<h1>TED Explore</h1>

<p>
	TED Explore is an attempt to determine the factors of a transcript that make it a good speech. This is modeled based on TED talk transcripts and their corresponding user ratings. We picked 175 TED Talk transcripts from 3 chosen categories - Informative, funny and confusing. 

	The process included creating feature sets for each category, running Lasso regression and determining the features that contribute the most to the characteristic. Additionaly, the structure of a talk was also analysed with the *What is-What could be* metric proposed by Nancy Duarte - a TED Partner who guides TED speakers with her presentation techniques.
