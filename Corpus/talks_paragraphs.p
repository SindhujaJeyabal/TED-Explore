S"\nGood morning. How are you? It's been great, hasn't it?\nI've been blown away by the whole thing.\nIn fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter)\nThere have been three themes, haven't there,\nrunning through the conference, which are relevant\nto what I want to talk about.\nOne is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity\nin all of the presentations that we've had\nand in all of the people here. Just the variety of it\nand the range of it. The second is that\nit's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen,\nin terms of the future. No idea\nhow this may play out."
p2
aS'\nI have an interest in education --\nactually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.\nDon\'t you? I find this very interesting.\nIf you\'re at a dinner party, and you say\nyou work in education --\nactually, you\'re not often at dinner parties, frankly, if you work in education.\n(Laughter) You\'re not asked.\nAnd you\'re never asked back, curiously. That\'s strange to me.\nBut if you are, and you say to somebody,\nyou know, they say, "What do you do?"\nand you say you work in education,\nyou can see the blood run from their face. They\'re like,\n"Oh my God," you know, "Why me? My one night out all week." (Laughter)\nBut if you ask about their education,\nthey pin you to the wall. Because it\'s one of those things\nthat goes deep with people, am I right?\nLike religion, and money and other things.\nI have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.\nWe have a huge vested interest in it,\npartly because it\'s education that\'s meant to\ntake us into this future that we can\'t grasp.\nIf you think of it, children starting school this year\nwill be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue --\ndespite all the expertise that\'s been on parade for the past four days --\nwhat the world will look like\nin five years\' time. And yet we\'re meant\nto be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think,\nis extraordinary.'
p3
aS"\nAnd the third part of this is that\nwe've all agreed, nonetheless, on the\nreally extraordinary capacities that children have --\ntheir capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel,\nwasn't she? Just seeing what she could do.\nAnd she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,\nexceptional in the whole of childhood.\nWhat you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication\nwho found a talent. And my contention is,\nall kids have tremendous talents.\nAnd we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.\nSo I want to talk about education and\nI want to talk about creativity. My contention is that\ncreativity now is as important in education as literacy,\nand we should treat it with the same status.\n(Applause) Thank you. That was it, by the way.\nThank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left.\nWell, I was born ... no. (Laughter)"
p4
aS'\nI heard a great story recently -- I love telling it --\nof a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six\nand she was at the back, drawing,\nand the teacher said this little girl hardly ever\npaid attention, and in this drawing lesson she did.\nThe teacher was fascinated and she went over to her\nand she said, "What are you drawing?"\nAnd the girl said, "I\'m drawing a picture of God."\nAnd the teacher said, "But nobody knows what God looks like."\nAnd the girl said, "They will in a minute."\n(Laughter)'
p5
aS'\nWhen my son was four in England --\nactually he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter)\nIf we\'re being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.\nHe was in the Nativity play.\nDo you remember the story? No, it was big.\nIt was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel.\nYou may have seen it: "Nativity II." But James got the part of Joseph,\nwhich we were thrilled about.\nWe considered this to be one of the lead parts.\nWe had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:\n"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)\nHe didn\'t have to speak, but you know the bit\nwhere the three kings come in. They come in bearing gifts,\nand they bring gold, frankincense and myrrh.\nThis really happened. We were sitting there\nand I think they just went out of sequence,\nbecause we talked to the little boy afterward and we said,\n"You OK with that?" And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"\nThey just switched, that was it.\nAnyway, the three boys came in --\nfour-year-olds with tea towels on their heads --\nand they put these boxes down,\nand the first boy said, "I bring you gold."\nAnd the second boy said, "I bring you myrrh."\nAnd the third boy said, "Frank sent this." (Laughter)'
p6
aS"\nWhat these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.\nIf they don't know, they'll have a go.\nAm I right? They're not frightened of being wrong.\nNow, I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.\nWhat we do know is,\nif you're not prepared to be wrong,\nyou'll never come up with anything original --\nif you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults,\nmost kids have lost that capacity.\nThey have become frightened of being wrong.\nAnd we run our companies like this, by the way.\nWe stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running\nnational education systems where\nmistakes are the worst thing you can make.\nAnd the result is that we are educating people out of\ntheir creative capacities. Picasso once said this --\nhe said that all children are born artists.\nThe problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately,\nthat we don't grow into creativity,\nwe grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out if it.\nSo why is this?"
p7
aS'\nI lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.\nIn fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.\nSo you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.\n(Laughter) Actually,\nwe lived in a place called Snitterfield,\njust outside Stratford, which is where\nShakespeare\'s father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was.\nYou don\'t think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?\nDo you? Because you don\'t think of\nShakespeare being a child, do you?\nShakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was\nseven at some point. He was in\nsomebody\'s English class, wasn\'t he? How annoying would that be?\n(Laughter) "Must try harder." Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,\nto Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now,"\nto William Shakespeare, "and put the pencil down.\nAnd stop speaking like that. It\'s confusing everybody."\n(Laughter)'
p8
aS'\nAnyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles,\nand I just want to say a word about the transition, actually.\nMy son didn\'t want to come.\nI\'ve got two kids. He\'s 21 now; my daughter\'s 16.\nHe didn\'t want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it,\nbut he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah.\nHe\'d known her for a month.\nMind you, they\'d had their fourth anniversary,\nbecause it\'s a long time when you\'re 16.\nAnyway, he was really upset on the plane,\nand he said, "I\'ll never find another girl like Sarah."\nAnd we were rather pleased about that, frankly,\nbecause she was the main reason we were leaving the country.\n(Laughter)'
p9
aS"\nBut something strikes you when you move to America\nand when you travel around the world:\nEvery education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.\nEvery one. Doesn't matter where you go.\nYou'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.\nAt the top are mathematics and languages,\nthen the humanities, and the bottom are the arts.\nEverywhere on Earth.\nAnd in pretty much every system too,\nthere's a hierarchy within the arts.\nArt and music are normally given a higher status in schools\nthan drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet\nthat teaches dance everyday to children\nthe way we teach them mathematics. Why?\nWhy not? I think this is rather important.\nI think math is very important, but so is dance.\nChildren dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do.\nWe all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?\n(Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is,\nas children grow up, we start to educate them\nprogressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads.\nAnd slightly to one side."
p10
aS'\nIf you were to visit education, as an alien,\nand say "What\'s it for, public education?"\nI think you\'d have to conclude -- if you look at the output,\nwho really succeeds by this,\nwho does everything that they should,\nwho gets all the brownie points, who are the winners --\nI think you\'d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education\nthroughout the world\nis to produce university professors. Isn\'t it?\nThey\'re the people who come out the top.\nAnd I used to be one, so there. (Laughter)\nAnd I like university professors, but you know,\nwe shouldn\'t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement.\nThey\'re just a form of life,\nanother form of life. But they\'re rather curious,\nand I say this out of affection for them.\nThere\'s something curious about professors in my experience --\nnot all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads.\nThey live up there, and slightly to one side.\nThey\'re disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.\nThey look upon their body\nas a form of transport for their heads, don\'t they?\n(Laughter) It\'s a way of getting their head to meetings.\nIf you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences,\nby the way, get yourself along to a residential conference\nof senior academics,\nand pop into the discotheque on the final night.\n(Laughter) And there you will see it -- grown men and women\nwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat,\nwaiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.'
p11
aS"\nNow our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.\nAnd there's a reason.\nThe whole system was invented -- around the world, there were\nno public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.\nThey all came into being\nto meet the needs of industrialism.\nSo the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.\nNumber one, that the most useful subjects for work\nare at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away\nfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked,\non the grounds that you would\nnever get a job doing that. Is that right?\nDon't do music, you're not going to be a musician;\ndon't do art, you won't be an artist.\nBenign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world\nis engulfed in a revolution.\nAnd the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate\nour view of intelligence,\nbecause the universities designed the system in their image.\nIf you think of it, the whole system\nof public education around the world is a protracted process\nof university entrance.\nAnd the consequence is that many highly talented,\nbrilliant, creative people think they're not,\nbecause the thing they were good at at school\nwasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized.\nAnd I think we can't afford to go on that way."
p12
aS"\nIn the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,\nmore people worldwide will be graduating\nthrough education than since the beginning of history.\nMore people, and it's the combination\nof all the things we've talked about --\ntechnology and its transformation effect on work, and demography\nand the huge explosion in population.\nSuddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true?\nWhen I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.\nIf you didn't have a job it's because you didn't want one.\nAnd I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)\nBut now kids with degrees are often\nheading home to carry on playing video games,\nbecause you need an MA where the previous job required a BA,\nand now you need a PhD for the other.\nIt's a process of academic inflation.\nAnd it indicates the whole structure of education\nis shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink\nour view of intelligence."
p13
aS"\nWe know three things about intelligence.\nOne, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways\nthat we experience it. We think visually,\nwe think in sound, we think kinesthetically.\nWe think in abstract terms, we think in movement.\nSecondly, intelligence is dynamic.\nIf you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard\nyesterday from a number of presentations,\nintelligence is wonderfully interactive.\nThe brain isn't divided into compartments.\nIn fact, creativity -- which I define as the process\nof having original ideas that have value --\nmore often than not comes about through the interaction\nof different disciplinary ways of seeing things."
p14
aS'\nThe brain is intentionally -- by the way,\nthere\'s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain\ncalled the corpus callosum. It\'s thicker in women.\nFollowing off from Helen yesterday, I think\nthis is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.\nBecause you are, aren\'t you?\nThere\'s a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.\nIf my wife is cooking a meal at home --\nwhich is not often, thankfully. (Laughter)\nBut you know, she\'s doing -- no, she\'s good at some things --\nbut if she\'s cooking, you know,\nshe\'s dealing with people on the phone,\nshe\'s talking to the kids, she\'s painting the ceiling,\nshe\'s doing open-heart surgery over here.\nIf I\'m cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out,\nthe phone\'s on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.\nI say, "Terry, please, I\'m trying to fry an egg in here. Give me a break." (Laughter)\nActually, you know that old philosophical thing,\nif a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it,\ndid it happen? Remember that old chestnut?\nI saw a great t-shirt really recently which said, "If a man speaks his mind\nin a forest, and no woman hears him,\nis he still wrong?" (Laughter)'
p15
aS'\nAnd the third thing about intelligence is,\nit\'s distinct. I\'m doing a new book at the moment\ncalled "Epiphany," which is based on a series of\ninterviews with people about how they discovered\ntheir talent. I\'m fascinated by how people got to be there.\nIt\'s really prompted by a conversation I had\nwith a wonderful woman who maybe most people\nhave never heard of; she\'s called Gillian Lynne --\nhave you heard of her? Some have. She\'s a choreographer\nand everybody knows her work.\nShe did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."\nShe\'s wonderful. I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet in England,\nas you can see.\nAnyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said,\n"Gillian, how\'d you get to be a dancer?" And she said\nit was interesting; when she was at school,\nshe was really hopeless. And the school, in the \'30s,\nwrote to her parents and said, "We think\nGillian has a learning disorder." She couldn\'t concentrate;\nshe was fidgeting. I think now they\'d say\nshe had ADHD. Wouldn\'t you? But this was the 1930s,\nand ADHD hadn\'t been invented at this point.\nIt wasn\'t an available condition. (Laughter)\nPeople weren\'t aware they could have that.'
p16
aS'\nAnyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room,\nand she was there with her mother,\nand she was led and sat on this chair at the end,\nand she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while\nthis man talked to her mother about all\nthe problems Gillian was having at school. And at the end of it --\nbecause she was disturbing people;\nher homework was always late; and so on,\nlittle kid of eight -- in the end, the doctor went and sat\nnext to Gillian and said, "Gillian,\nI\'ve listened to all these things that your mother\'s\ntold me, and I need to speak to her privately."\nHe said, "Wait here. We\'ll be back; we won\'t be very long,"\nand they went and left her.\nBut as they went out the room, he turned on the radio\nthat was sitting on his desk. And when they\ngot out the room, he said to her mother,\n"Just stand and watch her." And the minute they left the room,\nshe said, she was on her feet, moving to the music.\nAnd they watched for a few minutes\nand he turned to her mother and said,\n"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn\'t sick; she\'s a dancer.\nTake her to a dance school."'
p17
aS'\nI said, "What happened?"\nShe said, "She did. I can\'t tell you how wonderful it was.\nWe walked in this room and it was full of\npeople like me. People who couldn\'t sit still.\nPeople who had to move to think." Who had to move to think.\nThey did ballet; they did tap; they did jazz;\nthey did modern; they did contemporary.\nShe was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School;\nshe became a soloist; she had a wonderful career\nat the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated\nfrom the Royal Ballet School and\nfounded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company --\nmet Andrew Lloyd Weber. She\'s been responsible for\nsome of the most successful musical theater\nproductions in history; she\'s given pleasure to millions;\nand she\'s a multi-millionaire. Somebody else\nmight have put her on medication and told her\nto calm down.'
p18
aS'\nNow, I think ... (Applause) What I think it comes to is this:\nAl Gore spoke the other night\nabout ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.\nI believe our only hope for the future\nis to adopt a new conception of human ecology,\none in which we start to reconstitute our conception\nof the richness of human capacity.\nOur education system has mined our minds in the way\nthat we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity.\nAnd for the future, it won\'t serve us.\nWe have to rethink the fundamental principles\non which we\'re educating our children. There was\na wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, "If all the insects\nwere to disappear from the earth,\nwithin 50 years all life on Earth would end.\nIf all human beings disappeared from the earth,\nwithin 50 years all forms of life would flourish."\nAnd he\'s right.'
p19
aS"\nWhat TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination.\nWe have to be careful now that we use this gift\nwisely and that we avert some of the scenarios\nthat we've talked about. And the only way\nwe'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities\nfor the richness they are and seeing\nour children for the hope that they are. And our task\nis to educate their whole being, so they can face this future.\nBy the way -- we may not see this future,\nbut they will. And our job is to help\nthem make something of it. Thank you very much."
p20
aa(lp21
S"\nSo I want to start by offering you a free\nno-tech life hack,\nand all it requires of you is this:\nthat you change your posture for two minutes.\nBut before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now\ndo a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.\nSo how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?\nMaybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,\nmaybe wrapping your ankles.\nSometimes we hold onto our arms like this.\nSometimes we spread out. (Laughter)\nI see you. (Laughter)\nSo I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.\nWe're going to come back to that in a few minutes,\nand I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit,\nit could significantly change the way your life unfolds."
p22
aS"\nSo, we're really fascinated with body language,\nand we're particularly interested\nin other people's body language.\nYou know, we're interested in, like, you know  (Laughter) \nan awkward interaction, or a smile,\nor a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,\nor maybe even something like a handshake."
p23
aS'\nNarrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10, and look at this\nlucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President\nof the United States. Oh, and here comes\nthe Prime Minister of the  ? No. (Laughter) (Applause)\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p24
aS"\nAmy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake,\ncan have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.\nEven the BBC and The New York Times.\nSo obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,\nor body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists --\nit's language, so we think about communication.\nWhen we think about communication, we think about interactions.\nSo what is your body language communicating to me?\nWhat's mine communicating to you?"
p25
aS"\nAnd there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid\nway to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot\nof time looking at the effects of our body language,\nor other people's body language, on judgments.\nAnd we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.\nAnd those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes\nlike who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.\nFor example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,\nshows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips\nof real physician-patient interactions,\ntheir judgments of the physician's niceness\npredict whether or not that physician will be sued.\nSo it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not\nthat physician was incompetent, but do we like that person\nand how they interacted?\nEven more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown\nus that judgments of political candidates' faces\nin just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate\nand gubernatorial race outcomes,\nand even, let's go digital,\nemoticons used well in online negotiations\ncan lead to you claim more value from that negotiation.\nIf you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?\nSo when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge\nothers, how they judge us and what the outcomes are.\nWe tend to forget, though, the other audience\nthat's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves."
p26
aS"\nWe are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts\nand our feelings and our physiology.\nSo what nonverbals am I talking about?\nI'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,\nand I teach at a competitive business school,\nso it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.\nI became especially interested in nonverbal expressions\nof power and dominance."
p27
aS"\nAnd what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?\nWell, this is what they are.\nSo in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.\nSo you make yourself big, you stretch out,\nyou take up space, you're basically opening up.\nIt's about opening up. And this is true\nacross the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates.\nAnd humans do the same thing. (Laughter)\nSo they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,\nand also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.\nAnd this one is especially interesting because it really shows us\nhow universal and old these expressions of power are.\nThis expression, which is known as pride,\nJessica Tracy has studied. She shows that\npeople who are born with sight\nand people who are congenitally blind do this\nwhen they win at a physical competition.\nSo when they cross the finish line and they've won,\nit doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.\nThey do this.\nSo the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.\nWhat do we do when we feel powerless? We do exactly\nthe opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up.\nWe make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us.\nSo again, both animals and humans do the same thing.\nAnd this is what happens when you put together high\nand low power. So what we tend to do\nwhen it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals.\nSo if someone is being really powerful with us,\nwe tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.\nWe do the opposite of them."
p28
aS"\nSo I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,\nand what do I notice? I notice that MBA students\nreally exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.\nSo you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,\nreally coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room\nbefore class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.\nWhen they sit down, they're sort of spread out.\nThey raise their hands like this.\nYou have other people who are virtually collapsing\nwhen they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.\nYou see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit\nin their chair and they make themselves tiny,\nand they go like this when they raise their hand.\nI notice a couple of things about this.\nOne, you're not going to be surprised.\nIt seems to be related to gender.\nSo women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.\nWomen feel chronically less powerful than men,\nso this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that\nit also seemed to be related to the extent to which\nthe students were participating, and how well they were participating.\nAnd this is really important in the MBA classroom,\nbecause participation counts for half the grade."
p29
aS"\nSo business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.\nYou get these equally qualified women and men coming in\nand then you get these differences in grades,\nand it seems to be partly attributable to participation.\nSo I started to wonder, you know, okay,\nso you have these people coming in like this, and they're\nparticipating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it\nand would it lead them to participate more?"
p30
aS"\nSo my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,\nand I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?\nLike, can you do this just for a little while and actually\nexperience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful?\nSo we know that our nonverbals govern how other people\nthink and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.\nBut our question really was, do our nonverbals\ngovern how we think and feel about ourselves?"
p31
aS"\nThere's some evidence that they do.\nSo, for example, we smile when we feel happy,\nbut also, when we're forced to smile\nby holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.\nSo it goes both ways. When it comes to power,\nit also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful,\nyou're more likely to do this, but it's also possible that\nwhen you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely\nto actually feel powerful."
p32
aS"\nSo the second question really was, you know,\nso we know that our minds change our bodies,\nbut is it also true that our bodies change our minds?\nAnd when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,\nwhat am I talking about?\nSo I'm talking about thoughts and feelings\nand the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,\nand in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.\nSo what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless\nlook like?\nSo powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,\nmore assertive and more confident, more optimistic.\nThey actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance.\nThey also tend to be able to think more abstractly.\nSo there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.\nThere are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.\nPhysiologically, there also are differences on two\nkey hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,\nand cortisol, which is the stress hormone.\nSo what we find is that\nhigh-power alpha males in primate hierarchies\nhave high testosterone and low cortisol,\nand powerful and effective leaders also have\nhigh testosterone and low cortisol.\nSo what does that mean? When you think about power,\npeople tended to think only about testosterone,\nbecause that was about dominance.\nBut really, power is also about how you react to stress.\nSo do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,\nhigh on testosterone, but really stress reactive?\nProbably not, right? You want the person\nwho's powerful and assertive and dominant,\nbut not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back."
p33
aS'\nSo we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha\nneeds to take over, if an individual needs to take over\nan alpha role sort of suddenly,\nwithin a few days, that individual\'s testosterone has gone up\nsignificantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.\nSo we have this evidence, both that the body can shape\nthe mind, at least at the facial level,\nand also that role changes can shape the mind.\nSo what happens, okay, you take a role change,\nwhat happens if you do that at a really minimal level,\nlike this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?\n"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this,\nand it\'s going to make you feel more powerful."'
p34
aS'\nSo this is what we did. We decided to bring people\ninto the lab and run a little experiment, and these people\nadopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses\nor low-power poses, and I\'m just going to show you\nfive of the poses, although they took on only two.\nSo here\'s one.\nA couple more.\nThis one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman"\nby the media.\nHere are a couple more.\nSo you can be standing or you can be sitting.\nAnd here are the low-power poses.\nSo you\'re folding up, you\'re making yourself small.\nThis one is very low-power.\nWhen you\'re touching your neck,\nyou\'re really protecting yourself.\nSo this is what happens. They come in,\nthey spit into a vial,\nwe for two minutes say, "You need to do this or this."\nThey don\'t look at pictures of the poses. We don\'t want to prime them\nwith a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power,\nright? So two minutes they do this.\nWe then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items,\nand then we give them an opportunity to gamble,\nand then we take another saliva sample.\nThat\'s it. That\'s the whole experiment.'
p35
aS"\nSo this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,\nwhat we find is that when you're in the high-power\npose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble.\nWhen you're in the low-power pose condition,\nonly 60 percent, and that's a pretty whopping significant difference.\nHere's what we find on testosterone.\nFrom their baseline when they come in, high-power people\nexperience about a 20-percent increase,\nand low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.\nSo again, two minutes, and you get these changes.\nHere's what you get on cortisol. High-power people\nexperience about a 25-percent decrease, and\nthe low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.\nSo two minutes lead to these hormonal changes\nthat configure your brain to basically be either\nassertive, confident and comfortable,\nor really stress-reactive, and, you know, feeling\nsort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right?\nSo it seems that our nonverbals do govern\nhow we think and feel about ourselves,\nso it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.\nAlso, our bodies change our minds."
p36
aS"\nBut the next question, of course, is\ncan power posing for a few minutes\nreally change your life in meaningful ways?\nSo this is in the lab. It's this little task, you know,\nit's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually\napply this? Which we cared about, of course.\nAnd so we think it's really, what matters, I mean,\nwhere you want to use this is evaluative situations\nlike social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated,\neither by your friends? Like for teenagers it's at the lunchroom table.\nIt could be, you know, for some people it's speaking\nat a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch\nor giving a talk like this\nor doing a job interview.\nWe decided that the one that most people could relate to\nbecause most people had been through\nwas the job interview."
p37
aS'\nSo we published these findings, and the media\nare all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do\nwhen you go in for the job interview, right? (Laughter)\nYou know, so we were of course horrified, and said,\nOh my God, no, no, no, that\'s not what we meant at all.\nFor numerous reasons, no, no, no, don\'t do that.\nAgain, this is not about you talking to other people.\nIt\'s you talking to yourself. What do you do\nbefore you go into a job interview? You do this.\nRight? You\'re sitting down. You\'re looking at your iPhone --\nor your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.\nYou are, you know, you\'re looking at your notes,\nyou\'re hunching up, making yourself small,\nwhen really what you should be doing maybe is this,\nlike, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.\nSo that\'s what we want to test. Okay?\nSo we bring people into a lab, and\nthey do either high- or low-power poses again,\nthey go through a very stressful job interview.\nIt\'s five minutes long. They are being recorded.\nThey\'re being judged also, and the judges\nare trained to give no nonverbal feedback,\nso they look like this. Like, imagine\nthis is the person interviewing you.\nSo for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.\nPeople hate this. It\'s what Marianne LaFrance calls\n"standing in social quicksand."\nSo this really spikes your cortisol.\nSo this is the job interview we put them through,\nbecause we really wanted to see what happened.\nWe then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.\nThey\'re blind to the hypothesis. They\'re blind to the conditions.\nThey have no idea who\'s been posing in what pose,\nand they end up looking at these sets of tapes,\nand they say, "Oh, we want to hire these people," --\nall the high-power posers -- "we don\'t want to hire these people.\nWe also evaluate these people much more positively overall."\nBut what\'s driving it? It\'s not about the content of the speech.\nIt\'s about the presence that they\'re bringing to the speech.\nWe also, because we rate them on all these variables\nrelated to competence, like, how well-structured\nis the speech? How good is it? What are their qualifications?\nNo effect on those things. This is what\'s affected.\nThese kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves,\nbasically. They\'re bringing themselves.\nThey bring their ideas, but as themselves,\nwith no, you know, residue over them.\nSo this is what\'s driving the effect, or mediating the effect.'
p38
aS'\nSo when I tell people about this,\nthat our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,\nand our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me,\n"I don\'t -- It feels fake." Right?\nSo I said, fake it till you make it. I don\'t -- It\'s not me.\nI don\'t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.\nI don\'t want to feel like an impostor.\nI don\'t want to get there only to feel like I\'m not supposed to be here.\nAnd that really resonated with me,\nbecause I want to tell you a little story about\nbeing an impostor and feeling like I\'m not supposed to be here.'
p39
aS'\nWhen I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.\nI was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.\nI was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury\nrehab ward, and I had been withdrawn from college,\nand I learned that my I.Q. had dropped by two standard deviations,\nwhich was very traumatic.\nI knew my I.Q. because I had identified with being smart,\nand I had been called gifted as a child.\nSo I\'m taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.\nThey say, "You\'re not going to finish college.\nJust, you know, there are other things for you to do,\nbut that\'s not going to work out for you."\nSo I really struggled with this, and I have to say,\nhaving your identity taken from you, your core identity,\nand for me it was being smart,\nhaving that taken from you, there\'s nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.\nSo I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked and worked,\nand I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked.'
p40
aS'\nEventually I graduated from college.\nIt took me four years longer than my peers,\nand I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,\nto take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,\nand I was like, I am not supposed to be here.\nI am an impostor.\nAnd the night before my first-year talk,\nand the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk\nto 20 people. That\'s it.\nI was so afraid of being found out the next day\nthat I called her and said, "I\'m quitting."\nShe was like, "You are not quitting,\nbecause I took a gamble on you, and you\'re staying.\nYou\'re going to stay, and this is what you\'re going to do.\nYou are going to fake it.\nYou\'re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.\nYou\'re just going to do it and do it and do it,\neven if you\'re terrified and just paralyzed\nand having an out-of-body experience, until you have\nthis moment where you say, \'Oh my gosh, I\'m doing it.\nLike, I have become this. I am actually doing this.\'"\nSo that\'s what I did. Five years in grad school,\na few years, you know, I\'m at Northwestern,\nI moved to Harvard, I\'m at Harvard, I\'m not really\nthinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,\n"Not supposed to be here. Not supposed to be here."'
p41
aS'\nSo at the end of my first year at Harvard,\na student who had not talked in class the entire semester,\nwho I had said, "Look, you\'ve gotta participate or else you\'re going to fail,"\ncame into my office. I really didn\'t know her at all.\nAnd she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said,\n"I\'m not supposed to be here."\nAnd that was the moment for me. Because two things happened.\nOne was that I realized,\noh my gosh, I don\'t feel like that anymore. You know.\nI don\'t feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.\nAnd the second was, she is supposed to be here!\nLike, she can fake it, she can become it.\nSo I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!\nAnd tomorrow you\'re going to fake it,\nyou\'re going to make yourself powerful, and, you know,\nyou\'re gonna  " (Applause)\n(Applause)\n"And you\'re going to go into the classroom,\nand you are going to give the best comment ever."\nYou know? And she gave the best comment ever,\nand people turned around and they were like,\noh my God, I didn\'t even notice her sitting there, you know? (Laughter)'
p42
aS"\nShe comes back to me months later, and I realized\nthat she had not just faked it till she made it,\nshe had actually faked it till she became it.\nSo she had changed.\nAnd so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.\nFake it till you become it. You know? It's not \nDo it enough until you actually become it and internalize."
p43
aS"\nThe last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.\nTiny tweaks can lead to big changes.\nSo this is two minutes.\nTwo minutes, two minutes, two minutes.\nBefore you go into the next stressful evaluative situation,\nfor two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator,\nin a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.\nThat's what you want to do. Configure your brain\nto cope the best in that situation.\nGet your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.\nDon't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.\nLeave that situation feeling like, oh, I really feel like\nI got to say who I am and show who I am."
p44
aS"\nSo I want to ask you first, you know,\nboth to try power posing,\nand also I want to ask you\nto share the science, because this is simple.\nI don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)\nGive it away. Share it with people,\nbecause the people who can use it the most are the ones\nwith no resources and no technology\nand no status and no power. Give it to them\nbecause they can do it in private.\nThey need their bodies, privacy and two minutes,\nand it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.\nThank you. (Applause)\n(Applause)"

S"\nHow do you explain when\nthings don't go as we assume?\nOr better, how do you explain\nwhen others are able to achieve things\nthat seem to defy all of the assumptions?\nFor example:\nWhy is Apple so innovative?\nYear after year, after year, after year,\nthey're more innovative than all their competition.\nAnd yet, they're just a computer company.\nThey're just like everyone else.\nThey have the same access to the same talent,\nthe same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.\nThen why is it that they\nseem to have something different?\nWhy is it that Martin Luther King\nled the Civil Rights Movement?\nHe wasn't the only man\nwho suffered in a pre-civil rights America,\nand he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.\nWhy him?\nAnd why is it that the Wright brothers\nwere able to figure out controlled, powered man flight\nwhen there were certainly other teams who were\nbetter qualified, better funded ...\nand they didn't achieve powered man flight,\nand the Wright brothers beat them to it.\nThere's something else at play here."
p47
aS"\nAbout three and a half years ago\nI made a discovery.\nAnd this discovery profoundly changed\nmy view on how I thought the world worked,\nand it even profoundly changed the way in which\nI operate in it.\nAs it turns out, there's a pattern.\nAs it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders\nand organizations in the world --\nwhether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers --\nthey all think, act and communicate\nthe exact same way.\nAnd it's the complete opposite\nto everyone else.\nAll I did was codify it,\nand it's probably the world's\nsimplest idea.\nI call it the golden circle."
p48
aS'\nWhy? How? What?\nThis little idea explains\nwhy some organizations and some leaders\nare able to inspire where others aren\'t.\nLet me define the terms really quickly.\nEvery single person, every single organization on the planet\nknows what they do,\n100 percent.\nSome know how they do it,\nwhether you call it your differentiated value proposition\nor your proprietary process or your USP.\nBut very, very few people or organizations\nknow why they do what they do.\nAnd by "why" I don\'t mean "to make a profit."\nThat\'s a result. It\'s always a result.\nBy "why," I mean: What\'s your purpose?\nWhat\'s your cause? What\'s your belief?\nWhy does your organization exist?\nWhy do you get out of bed in the morning?\nAnd why should anyone care?\nWell, as a result, the way we think, the way we act,\nthe way we communicate is from the outside in.\nIt\'s obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.\nBut the inspired leaders\nand the inspired organizations --\nregardless of their size, regardless of their industry --\nall think, act and communicate\nfrom the inside out.'
p49
aS'\nLet me give you an example.\nI use Apple because they\'re easy to understand and everybody gets it.\nIf Apple were like everyone else,\na marketing message from them might sound like this:\n"We make great computers.\nThey\'re beautifully designed, simple to use\nand user friendly.\nWant to buy one?" "Meh."\nAnd that\'s how most of us communicate.\nThat\'s how most marketing is done, that\'s how most sales is done\nand that\'s how most of us communicate interpersonally.\nWe say what we do, we say how we\'re different or how we\'re better\nand we expect some sort of a behavior,\na purchase, a vote, something like that.\nHere\'s our new law firm:\nWe have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,\nwe always perform for our clients who do business with us.\nHere\'s our new car:\nIt gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats, buy our car.\nBut it\'s uninspiring.'
p50
aS'\nHere\'s how Apple actually communicates.\n"Everything we do,\nwe believe in challenging the status quo.\nWe believe in thinking differently.\nThe way we challenge the status quo\nis by making our products beautifully designed,\nsimple to use and user friendly.\nWe just happen to make great computers.\nWant to buy one?"\nTotally different right? You\'re ready to buy a computer from me.\nAll I did was reverse the order of the information.\nWhat it proves to us is that people don\'t buy what you do;\npeople buy why you do it.\nPeople don\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.'
p51
aS"\nThis explains why\nevery single person in this room\nis perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.\nBut we're also perfectly comfortable\nbuying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,\nor a DVR from Apple.\nBut, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.\nThere's nothing that distinguishes them\nstructurally from any of their competitors.\nTheir competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.\nIn fact, they tried.\nA few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.\nThey're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs.\nThey've been making flat screen monitors for years.\nNobody bought one.\nDell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,\nand they make great quality products,\nand they can make perfectly well-designed products --\nand nobody bought one.\nIn fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine\nbuying an MP3 player from Dell.\nWhy would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?\nBut we do it every day.\nPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.\nThe goal is not to do business\nwith everybody who needs what you have.\nThe goal is to do business with people\nwho believe what you believe.\nHere's the best part:"
p52
aS'\nNone of what I\'m telling you is my opinion.\nIt\'s all grounded in the tenets of biology.\nNot psychology, biology.\nIf you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down,\nwhat you see is the human brain is actually broken\ninto three major components\nthat correlate perfectly with the golden circle.\nOur newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,\nour neocortex,\ncorresponds with the "what" level.\nThe neocortex is responsible for all of our\nrational and analytical thought\nand language.\nThe middle two sections make up our limbic brains,\nand our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,\nlike trust and loyalty.\nIt\'s also responsible for all human behavior,\nall decision-making,\nand it has no capacity for language.'
p53
aS'\nIn other words, when we communicate from the outside in,\nyes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information\nlike features and benefits and facts and figures.\nIt just doesn\'t drive behavior.\nWhen we can communicate from the inside out,\nwe\'re talking directly to the part of the brain\nthat controls behavior,\nand then we allow people to rationalize it\nwith the tangible things we say and do.\nThis is where gut decisions come from.\nYou know, sometimes you can give somebody\nall the facts and figures,\nand they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,\nbut it just doesn\'t feel right."\nWhy would we use that verb, it doesn\'t "feel" right?\nBecause the part of the brain that controls decision-making\ndoesn\'t control language.\nAnd the best we can muster up is, "I don\'t know. It just doesn\'t feel right."\nOr sometimes you say you\'re leading with your heart,\nor you\'re leading with your soul.\nWell, I hate to break it to you, those aren\'t other body parts\ncontrolling your behavior.\nIt\'s all happening here in your limbic brain,\nthe part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.'
p54
aS"\nBut if you don't know why you do what you do,\nand people respond to why you do what you do,\nthen how will you ever get people\nto vote for you, or buy something from you,\nor, more importantly, be loyal\nand want to be a part of what it is that you do.\nAgain, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;\nthe goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.\nThe goal is not just to hire people\nwho need a job;\nit's to hire people who believe what you believe.\nI always say that, you know,\nif you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,\nbut if you hire people who believe what you believe,\nthey'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.\nAnd nowhere else is there a better example of this\nthan with the Wright brothers."
p55
aS'\nMost people don\'t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.\nAnd back in the early 20th century,\nthe pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.\nEverybody was trying it.\nAnd Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,\nto be the recipe for success.\nI mean, even now, you ask people,\n"Why did your product or why did your company fail?"\nand people always give you the same permutation\nof the same three things:\nunder-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.\nIt\'s always the same three things, so let\'s explore that.\nSamuel Pierpont Langley\nwas given 50,000 dollars by the War Department\nto figure out this flying machine.\nMoney was no problem.\nHe held a seat at Harvard\nand worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;\nhe knew all the big minds of the day.\nHe hired the best minds\nmoney could find\nand the market conditions were fantastic.\nThe New York Times followed him around everywhere,\nand everyone was rooting for Langley.\nThen how come we\'ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?'
p56
aS"\nA few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio,\nOrville and Wilbur Wright,\nthey had none of what we consider\nto be the recipe for success.\nThey had no money;\nthey paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;\nnot a single person on the Wright brothers' team\nhad a college education,\nnot even Orville or Wilbur;\nand The New York Times followed them around nowhere.\nThe difference was,\nOrville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,\nby a purpose, by a belief.\nThey believed that if they\ncould figure out this flying machine,\nit'll change the course of the world.\nSamuel Pierpont Langley was different.\nHe wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.\nHe was in pursuit of the result.\nHe was in pursuit of the riches.\nAnd lo and behold, look what happened.\nThe people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream\nworked with them with blood and sweat and tears.\nThe others just worked for the paycheck.\nAnd they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,\nthey would have to take five sets of parts,\nbecause that's how many times they would crash\nbefore they came in for supper."
p57
aS'\nAnd, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,\nthe Wright brothers took flight,\nand no one was there to even experience it.\nWe found out about it a few days later.\nAnd further proof that Langley\nwas motivated by the wrong thing:\nThe day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.\nHe could have said,\n"That\'s an amazing discovery, guys,\nand I will improve upon your technology," but he didn\'t.\nHe wasn\'t first, he didn\'t get rich,\nhe didn\'t get famous so he quit.'
p58
aS"\nPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.\nAnd if you talk about what you believe,\nyou will attract those who believe what you believe.\nBut why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?\nSomething called the law of diffusion of innovation,\nand if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.\nThe first two and a half percent of our population\nare our innovators.\nThe next 13 and a half percent of our population\nare our early adopters.\nThe next 34 percent are your early majority,\nyour late majority and your laggards.\nThe only reason these people buy touch tone phones\nis because you can't buy rotary phones anymore."
p59
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p60
aS'\nWe all sit at various places at various times on this scale,\nbut what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us\nis that if you want mass-market success\nor mass-market acceptance of an idea,\nyou cannot have it\nuntil you achieve this tipping point\nbetween 15 and 18 percent market penetration,\nand then the system tips.\nAnd I love asking businesses, "What\'s your conversion on new business?"\nAnd they love to tell you, "Oh, it\'s about 10 percent," proudly.\nWell, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.\nWe all have about 10 percent who just "get it."\nThat\'s how we describe them, right?\nThat\'s like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."\nThe problem is: How do you find the ones that get it\nbefore you\'re doing business with them versus the ones who don\'t get it?\nSo it\'s this here, this little gap\nthat you have to close,\nas Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --\nbecause, you see, the early majority\nwill not try something\nuntil someone else\nhas tried it first.\nAnd these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,\nthey\'re comfortable making those gut decisions.\nThey\'re more comfortable making those intuitive decisions\nthat are driven by what they believe about the world\nand not just what product is available.'
p61
aS"\nThese are the people who stood in line for six hours\nto buy an iPhone when they first came out,\nwhen you could have just walked into the store the next week\nand bought one off the shelf.\nThese are the people who spent 40,000 dollars\non flat screen TVs when they first came out,\neven though the technology was substandard.\nAnd, by the way, they didn't do it\nbecause the technology was so great;\nthey did it for themselves.\nIt's because they wanted to be first.\nPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it\nand what you do simply\nproves what you believe.\nIn fact, people will do the things\nthat prove what they believe.\nThe reason that person bought the iPhone\nin the first six hours,\nstood in line for six hours,\nwas because of what they believed about the world,\nand how they wanted everybody to see them:\nThey were first.\nPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."
p62
aS"\nSo let me give you a famous example,\na famous failure and a famous success\nof the law of diffusion of innovation.\nFirst, the famous failure.\nIt's a commercial example.\nAs we said before, a second ago,\nthe recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions,\nright? You should have success then.\nLook at TiVo.\nFrom the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago\nto this current day,\nthey are the single highest-quality product on the market,\nhands down, there is no dispute.\nThey were extremely well-funded.\nMarket conditions were fantastic.\nI mean, we use TiVo as verb.\nI TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time."
p63
aS'\nBut TiVo\'s a commercial failure.\nThey\'ve never made money.\nAnd when they went IPO,\ntheir stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars\nand then plummeted, and it\'s never traded above 10.\nIn fact, I don\'t think it\'s even traded above six,\nexcept for a couple of little spikes.\nBecause you see, when TiVo launched their product\nthey told us all what they had.\nThey said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,\nskips commercials, rewinds live TV\nand memorizes your viewing habits\nwithout you even asking."\nAnd the cynical majority said,\n"We don\'t believe you.\nWe don\'t need it. We don\'t like it.\nYou\'re scaring us."\nWhat if they had said,\n"If you\'re the kind of person\nwho likes to have total control\nover every aspect of your life,\nboy, do we have a product for you.\nIt pauses live TV, skips commercials,\nmemorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."\nPeople don\'t buy what you do; they buy why you do it,\nand what you do simply serves as\nthe proof of what you believe.'
p64
aS'\nNow let me give you a successful example\nof the law of diffusion of innovation.\nIn the summer of 1963,\n250,000 people showed up\non the mall in Washington\nto hear Dr. King speak.\nThey sent out no invitations,\nand there was no website to check the date.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, Dr. King wasn\'t the only man in America\nwho was a great orator.\nHe wasn\'t the only man in America who suffered\nin a pre-civil rights America.\nIn fact, some of his ideas were bad.\nBut he had a gift.\nHe didn\'t go around telling people what needed to change in America.\nHe went around and told people what he believed.\n"I believe, I believe, I believe,"\nhe told people.\nAnd people who believed what he believed\ntook his cause, and they made it their own,\nand they told people.\nAnd some of those people created structures\nto get the word out to even more people.\nAnd lo and behold,\n250,000 people showed up\non the right day at the right time\nto hear him speak.'
p65
aS'\nHow many of them showed up for him?\nZero.\nThey showed up for themselves.\nIt\'s what they believed about America\nthat got them to travel in a bus for eight hours\nto stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.\nIt\'s what they believed, and it wasn\'t about black versus white:\n25 percent of the audience was white.\nDr. King believed that\nthere are two types of laws in this world:\nthose that are made by a higher authority\nand those that are made by man.\nAnd not until all the laws that are made by man\nare consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority\nwill we live in a just world.\nIt just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement\nwas the perfect thing to help him\nbring his cause to life.\nWe followed, not for him, but for ourselves.\nAnd, by the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,\nnot the "I have a plan" speech.'
p66
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p67
aS'\nListen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.\nThey\'re not inspiring anybody.\nBecause there are leaders and there are those who lead.\nLeaders hold a position of power\nor authority,\nbut those who lead inspire us.\nWhether they\'re individuals or organizations,\nwe follow those who lead,\nnot because we have to,\nbut because we want to.\nWe follow those who lead, not for them,\nbut for ourselves.\nAnd it\'s those who start with "why"\nthat have the ability\nto inspire those around them\nor find others who inspire them.'

S'\nSo, I\'ll start with this:\na couple years ago, an event planner called me\nbecause I was going to do a speaking event.\nAnd she called, and she said,\n"I\'m really struggling with how\nto write about you on the little flyer."\nAnd I thought, "Well, what\'s the struggle?"\nAnd she said, "Well, I saw you speak,\nand I\'m going to call you a researcher, I think,\nbut I\'m afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come,\nbecause they\'ll think you\'re boring and irrelevant."\n(Laughter)\nAnd I was like, "Okay."\nAnd she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk\nis you\'re a storyteller.\nSo I think what I\'ll do is just call you a storyteller."\nAnd of course, the academic, insecure part of me\nwas like, "You\'re going to call me a what?"\nAnd she said, "I\'m going to call you a storyteller."\nAnd I was like, "Why not magic pixie?"\n(Laughter)\nI was like, "Let me think about this for a second."\nI tried to call deep on my courage.\nAnd I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.\nI\'m a qualitative researcher.\nI collect stories; that\'s what I do.\nAnd maybe stories are just data with a soul.\nAnd maybe I\'m just a storyteller.\nAnd so I said, "You know what?\nWhy don\'t you just say I\'m a researcher-storyteller."\nAnd she went, "Haha. There\'s no such thing."\n(Laughter)\nSo I\'m a researcher-storyteller,\nand I\'m going to talk to you today --\nwe\'re talking about expanding perception --\nand so I want to talk to you and tell some stories\nabout a piece of my research\nthat fundamentally expanded my perception\nand really actually changed the way that I live and love\nand work and parent.'
p72
aS'\nAnd this is where my story starts.\nWhen I was a young researcher, doctoral student,\nmy first year I had a research professor\nwho said to us,\n"Here\'s the thing,\nif you cannot measure it, it does not exist."\nAnd I thought he was just sweet-talking me.\nI was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."\nAnd so you have to understand\nthat I have a bachelor\'s in social work, a master\'s in social work,\nand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\nso my entire academic career\nwas surrounded by people\nwho kind of believed\nin the "life\'s messy, love it."\nAnd I\'m more of the, "life\'s messy,\nclean it up, organize it\nand put it into a bento box."\n(Laughter)\nAnd so to think that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me --\nreally, one of the big sayings in social work\nis, "Lean into the discomfort of the work."\nAnd I\'m like, knock discomfort upside the head\nand move it over and get all A\'s.\nThat was my mantra.\nSo I was very excited about this.\nAnd so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me,\nbecause I am interested in some messy topics.\nBut I want to be able to make them not messy.\nI want to understand them.\nI want to hack into these things\nI know are important\nand lay the code out for everyone to see.'

aS'\nSo where I started was with connection.\nBecause, by the time you\'re a social worker for 10 years,\nwhat you realize\nis that connection is why we\'re here.\nIt\'s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.\nThis is what it\'s all about.\nIt doesn\'t matter whether you talk to people\nwho work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect,\nwhat we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is --\nneurobiologically that\'s how we\'re wired --\nit\'s why we\'re here.\nSo I thought, you know what, I\'m going to start with connection.\nWell, you know that situation\nwhere you get an evaluation from your boss,\nand she tells you 37 things you do really awesome,\nand one thing -- an "opportunity for growth?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right?\nWell, apparently this is the way my work went as well,\nbecause, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak.\nWhen you ask people about belonging,\nthey\'ll tell you their most excruciating experiences\nof being excluded.\nAnd when you ask people about connection,\nthe stories they told me were about disconnection.'
p74
aS'\nSo very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research --\nI ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\nin a way that I didn\'t understand or had never seen.\nAnd so I pulled back out of the research\nand thought, I need to figure out what this is.\nAnd it turned out to be shame.\nAnd shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection:\nIs there something about me\nthat, if other people know it or see it,\nthat I won\'t be worthy of connection?\nThe things I can tell you about it:\nit\'s universal; we all have it.\nThe only people who don\'t experience shame\nhave no capacity for human empathy or connection.\nNo one wants to talk about it,\nand the less you talk about it the more you have it.\nWhat underpinned this shame,\nthis "I\'m not good enough," --\nwhich we all know that feeling:\n"I\'m not blank enough. I\'m not thin enough,\nrich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough,\npromoted enough."\nThe thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability,\nthis idea of,\nin order for connection to happen,\nwe have to allow ourselves to be seen,\nreally seen.'
p75
aS"\nAnd you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.\nAnd so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick.\nI'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out,\nI'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,\nI'm going to understand how vulnerability works,\nand I'm going to outsmart it.\nSo I was ready, and I was really excited.\nAs you know, it's not going to turn out well.\n(Laughter)\nYou know this.\nSo, I could tell you a lot about shame,\nbut I'd have to borrow everyone else's time.\nBut here's what I can tell you that it boils down to --\nand this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned\nin the decade of doing this research.\nMy one year\nturned into six years:\nthousands of stories,\nhundreds of long interviews, focus groups.\nAt one point, people were sending me journal pages\nand sending me their stories --\nthousands of pieces of data in six years.\nAnd I kind of got a handle on it."
p76
aS"\nI kind of understood, this is what shame is,\nthis is how it works.\nI wrote a book,\nI published a theory,\nbut something was not okay --\nand what it was is that,\nif I roughly took the people I interviewed\nand divided them into people\nwho really have a sense of worthiness --\nthat's what this comes down to,\na sense of worthiness --\nthey have a strong sense of love and belonging --\nand folks who struggle for it,\nand folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.\nThere was only one variable\nthat separated the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\nand the people who really struggle for it.\nAnd that was, the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\nbelieve they're worthy of love and belonging.\nThat's it.\nThey believe they're worthy.\nAnd to me, the hard part\nof the one thing that keeps us out of connection\nis our fear that we're not worthy of connection,\nwas something that, personally and professionally,\nI felt like I needed to understand better.\nSo what I did\nis I took all of the interviews\nwhere I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way,\nand just looked at those."
p77
aS"\nWhat do these people have in common?\nI have a slight office supply addiction,\nbut that's another talk.\nSo I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie,\nand I was like, what am I going to call this research?\nAnd the first words that came to my mind\nwere whole-hearted.\nThese are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.\nSo I wrote at the top of the manila folder,\nand I started looking at the data.\nIn fact, I did it first\nin a four-day\nvery intensive data analysis,\nwhere I went back, pulled these interviews, pulled the stories, pulled the incidents.\nWhat's the theme? What's the pattern?\nMy husband left town with the kids\nbecause I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing,\nwhere I'm just like writing\nand in my researcher mode.\nAnd so here's what I found.\nWhat they had in common\nwas a sense of courage.\nAnd I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.\nCourage, the original definition of courage,\nwhen it first came into the English language --\nit's from the Latin word cor, meaning heart --\nand the original definition\nwas to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.\nAnd so these folks\nhad, very simply, the courage\nto be imperfect.\nThey had the compassion\nto be kind to themselves first and then to others,\nbecause, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people\nif we can't treat ourselves kindly.\nAnd the last was they had connection,\nand -- this was the hard part --\nas a result of authenticity,\nthey were willing to let go of who they thought they should be\nin order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that\nfor connection."
p78
aS'\nThe other thing that they had in common\nwas this:\nThey fully embraced vulnerability.\nThey believed\nthat what made them vulnerable\nmade them beautiful.\nThey didn\'t talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable,\nnor did they really talk about it being excruciating --\nas I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.\nThey just talked about it being necessary.\nThey talked about the willingness\nto say, "I love you" first,\nthe willingness\nto do something\nwhere there are no guarantees,\nthe willingness\nto breathe through waiting for the doctor to call\nafter your mammogram.\nThey\'re willing to invest in a relationship\nthat may or may not work out.\nThey thought this was fundamental.'
p79
aS'\nI personally thought it was betrayal.\nI could not believe I had pledged allegiance\nto research, where our job --\nyou know, the definition of research\nis to control and predict, to study phenomena,\nfor the explicit reason\nto control and predict.\nAnd now my mission\nto control and predict\nhad turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability\nand to stop controlling and predicting.\nThis led to a little breakdown --\n(Laughter)\n-- which actually looked more like this.\n(Laughter)\nAnd it did.\nI call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.\nA spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown,\nbut I assure you it was a breakdown.\nAnd I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.\nLet me tell you something: you know who you are\nwhen you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody.\nDo you have any recommendations?"\nBecause about five of my friends were like,\n"Wooo. I wouldn\'t want to be your therapist."\n(Laughter)\nI was like, "What does that mean?"\nAnd they\'re like, "I\'m just saying, you know.\nDon\'t bring your measuring stick."\nI was like, "Okay."'
p80
aS'\nSo I found a therapist.\nMy first meeting with her, Diana --\nI brought in my list\nof the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.\nAnd she said, "How are you?"\nAnd I said, "I\'m great. I\'m okay."\nShe said, "What\'s going on?"\nAnd this is a therapist who sees therapists,\nbecause we have to go to those,\nbecause their B.S. meters are good.\n(Laughter)\nAnd so I said,\n"Here\'s the thing, I\'m struggling."\nAnd she said, "What\'s the struggle?"\nAnd I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.\nAnd I know that vulnerability is the core\nof shame and fear\nand our struggle for worthiness,\nbut it appears that it\'s also the birthplace\nof joy, of creativity,\nof belonging, of love.\nAnd I think I have a problem,\nand I need some help."\nAnd I said, "But here\'s the thing:\nno family stuff,\nno childhood shit."\n(Laughter)\n"I just need some strategies."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nThank you.\nSo she goes like this.\n(Laughter)\nAnd then I said, "It\'s bad, right?"\nAnd she said, "It\'s neither good nor bad."\n(Laughter)\n"It just is what it is."\nAnd I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."'
p81
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p82
aS"\nAnd it did, and it didn't.\nAnd it took about a year.\nAnd you know how there are people\nthat, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important,\nthat they surrender and walk into it.\nA: that's not me,\nand B: I don't even hang out with people like that.\n(Laughter)\nFor me, it was a yearlong street fight.\nIt was a slugfest.\nVulnerability pushed, I pushed back.\nI lost the fight,\nbut probably won my life back."
p83
aS'\nAnd so then I went back into the research\nand spent the next couple of years\nreally trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted,\nwhat choices they were making,\nand what are we doing\nwith vulnerability.\nWhy do we struggle with it so much?\nAm I alone in struggling with vulnerability?\nNo.\nSo this is what I learned.\nWe numb vulnerability --\nwhen we\'re waiting for the call.\nIt was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook\nthat says, "How would you define vulnerability?\nWhat makes you feel vulnerable?"\nAnd within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses.\nBecause I wanted to know\nwhat\'s out there.\nHaving to ask my husband for help\nbecause I\'m sick, and we\'re newly married;\ninitiating sex with my husband;\ninitiating sex with my wife;\nbeing turned down; asking someone out;\nwaiting for the doctor to call back;\ngetting laid off; laying off people --\nthis is the world we live in.\nWe live in a vulnerable world.\nAnd one of the ways we deal with it\nis we numb vulnerability.'
p84
aS"\nAnd I think there's evidence --\nand it's not the only reason this evidence exists,\nbut I think it's a huge cause --\nwe are the most in-debt,\nobese,\naddicted and medicated\nadult cohort in U.S. history.\nThe problem is -- and I learned this from the research --\nthat you cannot selectively numb emotion.\nYou can't say, here's the bad stuff.\nHere's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame,\nhere's fear, here's disappointment.\nI don't want to feel these.\nI'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.\n(Laughter)\nI don't want to feel these.\nAnd I know that's knowing laughter.\nI hack into your lives for a living.\nGod.\n(Laughter)\nYou can't numb those hard feelings\nwithout numbing the other affects, our emotions.\nYou cannot selectively numb.\nSo when we numb those,\nwe numb joy,\nwe numb gratitude,\nwe numb happiness.\nAnd then we are miserable,\nand we are looking for purpose and meaning,\nand then we feel vulnerable,\nso then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.\nAnd it becomes this dangerous cycle."
p85
aS'\nOne of the things that I think we need to think about\nis why and how we numb.\nAnd it doesn\'t just have to be addiction.\nThe other thing we do\nis we make everything that\'s uncertain certain.\nReligion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery\nto certainty.\nI\'m right, you\'re wrong. Shut up.\nThat\'s it.\nJust certain.\nThe more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are,\nthe more afraid we are.\nThis is what politics looks like today.\nThere\'s no discourse anymore.\nThere\'s no conversation.\nThere\'s just blame.\nYou know how blame is described in the research?\nA way to discharge pain and discomfort.\nWe perfect.\nIf there\'s anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me,\nbut it doesn\'t work.\nBecause what we do is we take fat from our butts\nand put it in our cheeks.\n(Laughter)\nWhich just, I hope in 100 years,\npeople will look back and go, "Wow."'
p86
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p87
aS'\nAnd we perfect, most dangerously,\nour children.\nLet me tell you what we think about children.\nThey\'re hardwired for struggle when they get here.\nAnd when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand,\nour job is not to say, "Look at her, she\'s perfect.\nMy job is just to keep her perfect --\nmake sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade."\nThat\'s not our job.\nOur job is to look and say,\n"You know what? You\'re imperfect, and you\'re wired for struggle,\nbut you are worthy of love and belonging."\nThat\'s our job.\nShow me a generation of kids raised like that,\nand we\'ll end the problems I think that we see today.\nWe pretend that what we do\ndoesn\'t have an effect on people.\nWe do that in our personal lives.\nWe do that corporate --\nwhether it\'s a bailout, an oil spill,\na recall --\nwe pretend like what we\'re doing\ndoesn\'t have a huge impact on other people.\nI would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.\nWe just need you to be authentic and real\nand say, "We\'re sorry.\nWe\'ll fix it."'
p88
aS'\nBut there\'s another way, and I\'ll leave you with this.\nThis is what I have found:\nto let ourselves be seen,\ndeeply seen,\nvulnerably seen;\nto love with our whole hearts,\neven though there\'s no guarantee --\nand that\'s really hard,\nand I can tell you as a parent, that\'s excruciatingly difficult --\nto practice gratitude and joy\nin those moments of terror,\nwhen we\'re wondering, "Can I love you this much?\nCan I believe in this this passionately?\nCan I be this fierce about this?"\njust to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen,\nto say, "I\'m just so grateful,\nbecause to feel this vulnerable means I\'m alive."\nAnd the last, which I think is probably the most important,\nis to believe that we\'re enough.\nBecause when we work from a place,\nI believe, that says, "I\'m enough,"\nthen we stop screaming and start listening,\nwe\'re kinder and gentler to the people around us,\nand we\'re kinder and gentler to ourselves.'
p89
aS"\nThat's all I have. Thank you."

p91
aa(lp92
S"\nI grew up to study the brain\nbecause I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder:\nschizophrenia. And as a sister\nand later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand, why\nis it that I can take my dreams, I can connect\nthem to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true?\nWhat is it about my brother's brain and\nhis schizophrenia that he cannot connect his\ndreams to a common and shared reality, so they\ninstead become delusion?"
p93
aS'\nSo I dedicated my career to research into the\nsevere mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state\nof Indiana to Boston, where I was working in\nthe lab of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard\nDepartment of Psychiatry. And in the lab, we were asking the question,\n"What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals\nwho would be diagnosed as normal control,\nas compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with\nschizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"'
p94
aS"\nSo we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry\nof the brain: which cells are communicating with\nwhich cells, with which chemicals, and then in\nwhat quantities of those chemicals?\nSo there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing\nthis type of research during the day.\nBut then in the evenings and on the weekends,\nI traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nBut on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up\nto discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.\nA blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.\nAnd in the course of four hours,\nI watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to\nprocess all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage,\nI could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.\nI essentially became an infant in a woman's body."
p95
aS"\nIf you've ever seen a human brain,\nit's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.\nAnd I have brought for you a real human brain.\nSo this is a real human brain."
p96
aS"\nThis is the front of the brain,\nthe back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down,\nand this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.\nAnd when you look at the brain, it's obvious that\nthe two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another.\nFor those of you who understand computers,\nour right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor,\nwhile our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.\nThe two hemispheres do communicate with one another\nthrough the corpus collosum,\nwhich is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.\nBut other than that,\nthe two hemispheres are completely separate.\nBecause they process information differently,\neach of our hemispheres think about different things,\nthey care about different things, and, dare I say,\nthey have very different personalities."
p97
aS"\nExcuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been."
p98
aS'\nOur right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.\nIt\'s all about "right here, right now."\nOur right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures\nand it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.\nInformation, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously\nthrough all of our sensory systems\nand then it explodes into this enormous collage\nof what this present moment looks like,\nwhat this present moment smells like and tastes like,\nwhat it feels like and what it sounds like.\nI am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me\nthrough the consciousness of my right hemisphere.\nWe are energy-beings connected to one another\nthrough the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family.\nAnd right here,\nright now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,\nhere to make the world a better place.\nAnd in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.'
p99
aS'\nMy left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place.\nOur left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.\nOur left hemisphere\nis all about the past and it\'s all about the future.\nOur left hemisphere is designed to take that\nenormous collage of the present moment and start\npicking out details, details and more details about those details.\nIt then categorizes and\norganizes all that information, associates it\nwith everything in the past we\'ve ever learned, and\nprojects into the future all of our possibilities.\nAnd our left hemisphere thinks in language.\nIt\'s that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my\ninternal world to my external world.\nIt\'s that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you gotta remember\nto pick up bananas on your way home.\nI need them in the morning."'
p100
aS'\nIt\'s that calculating intelligence that reminds me\nwhen I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,\nit\'s that little voice that says to me,\n"I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am,"\nI become separate.\nI become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow\naround me and separate from you.\nAnd this was the portion of my brain that I lost\non the morning of my stroke.'
p101
aS'\nOn the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a\npounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain --\ncaustic pain -- that you get when you\nbite into ice cream. And it just gripped me --\nand then it released me. And then it just gripped me --\nand then it released me. And it was very unusual\nfor me to ever experience any kind of pain,\nso I thought, "OK, I\'ll just start my normal routine."'
p102
aS'\nSo I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,\nwhich is a full-body, full-exercise machine.\nAnd I\'m jamming away on this thing, and I\'m realizing\nthat my hands look like primitive claws grasping\nonto the bar. And I thought, "That\'s very peculiar."\nAnd I looked down at my body and I thought, "Whoa,\nI\'m a weird-looking thing." And it was as though\nmy consciousness had shifted away from my normal\nperception of reality, where I\'m the person on the\nmachine having the experience, to some esoteric space\nwhere I\'m witnessing myself having this experience.'
p103
aS'\nAnd it was all very peculiar, and my headache was\njust getting worse. So I get off the machine,\nand I\'m walking across my living room floor, and I\nrealize that everything inside of my body has\nslowed way down. And every step is very rigid and\nvery deliberate. There\'s no fluidity to my pace,\nand there\'s this constriction in my area of perceptions,\nso I\'m just focused on internal systems.\nAnd I\'m standing in my bathroom getting ready to\nstep into the shower, and I could actually hear the\ndialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice\nsaying, "OK. You muscles, you gotta contract.\nYou muscles, you relax."'
p104
aS"\nAnd then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.\nAnd I look down at my arm and I realize\nthat I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.\nI can't define where I begin and where I end,\nbecause the atoms and the molecules of my arm\nblended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.\nAnd all I could detect was this energy -- energy."
p105
aS'\nAnd I\'m asking myself, "What is wrong with me?\nWhat is going on?" And in that moment, my brain chatter --\nmy left hemisphere brain chatter -- went totally silent.\nJust like someone took a remote control\nand pushed the mute button. Total silence.\nAnd at first I was shocked to find myself\ninside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately\ncaptivated by the magnificence of the energy around me.\nAnd because I could no longer identify\nthe boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive.\nI felt at one with all the energy that was,\nand it was beautiful there.'
p106
aS'\nThen all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back\nonline, and it says to me, "Hey! We got a problem!\nWe got a problem! We gotta get some help."\nAnd I\'m going, "Ahh! I got a problem.\nI got a problem." So it\'s like, "OK. OK. I got a problem."'
p107
aS'\nBut then I immediately drifted right back\nout into the consciousness -- and I affectionately\nrefer to this space as La La Land.\nBut it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would\nbe like to be totally disconnected from your brain\nchatter that connects you to the external world.'
p108
aS'\nSo here I am in this space, and my job -- and any\nstress related to my job -- it was gone.\nAnd I felt lighter in my body. And imagine\nall of the relationships in the external world and any\nstressors related to any of those -- they were gone.\nAnd I felt this sense of peacefulness.\nAnd imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage!\n(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --\neuphoria. It was beautiful.'
p109
aS'\nAnd then, again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says,\n"Hey! You\'ve got to pay attention.\nWe\'ve got to get help." And I\'m thinking, "I got to get help.\nI gotta focus."\nSo I get out of the shower and I mechanically\ndress and I\'m walking around my apartment,\nand I\'m thinking, "I gotta get to work. I gotta get to work.\nCan I drive? Can I drive?"'
p110
aS'\nAnd in that moment my right arm went totally\nparalyzed by my side. Then I realized,\n"Oh my gosh! I\'m having a stroke! I\'m having a stroke!"'
p111
aS'\nAnd the next thing my brain says to me is, "Wow!\nThis is so cool." (Laughter) "This is so cool!\nHow many brain scientists have the opportunity\nto study their own brain from the inside out?"\n(Laughter)'
p112
aS'\nAnd then it crosses my mind, "But I\'m a very busy woman!"\n(Laughter) "I don\'t have time for a stroke!"'
p113
aS'\nSo I\'m like, "OK, I can\'t stop the stroke from happening,\nso I\'ll do this for a week or two, and\nthen I\'ll get back to my routine. OK.\nSo I gotta call help. I gotta call work."\nI couldn\'t remember the number at work,\nso I remembered, in my office I had a business card\nwith my number on it. So I go into my business room,\nI pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.\nAnd I\'m looking at the card on top and even though\nI could see clearly in my mind\'s eye what my business card looked like,\nI couldn\'t tell if this\nwas my card or not, because all I could see were pixels.\nAnd the pixels of the words blended\nwith the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,\nand I just couldn\'t tell.\nAnd then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.\nAnd in that moment, I would be able to\nreattach to normal reality and I could tell\nthat\'s not the card ... that\'s not the card ... that\'s not the card.\nIt took me 45 minutes to get one inch down\ninside of that stack of cards.\nIn the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is\ngetting bigger in my left hemisphere.\nI do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone,\nbut it\'s the only plan I have.\nSo I take the phone pad and I put it right here. I take the business card,\nI put it right here, and\nI\'m matching the shape of the squiggles on the card\nto the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.\nBut then I would drift back out into La La Land,\nand not remember when I came back if I\'d already\ndialed those numbers.\nSo I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump\nand cover the numbers as I went along and pushed\nthem, so that as I would come back to normal\nreality, I\'d be able to tell, "Yes, I\'ve already dialed that number."'
p114
aS'\nEventually, the whole number gets dialed\nand I\'m listening to the phone, and\nmy colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,\n"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) And I think to myself,\n"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"'
p115
aS'\nAnd so I say to him -- clear in my mind, I say to him:\n"This is Jill! I need help!"\nAnd what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo."\nI\'m thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever."\nSo I couldn\'t know -- I didn\'t know that\nI couldn\'t speak or understand language until I tried.\nSo he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.'
p116
aS'\nAnd a little while later, I am riding in an\nambulance from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.\nAnd I curl up into a little fetal ball.\nAnd just like a balloon with the last bit of air,\njust, just right out of the balloon,\nI just felt my energy lift and just -- I felt my spirit surrender.'
p117
aS'\nAnd in that moment, I knew that I\nwas no longer the choreographer of my life.\nAnd either the doctors rescue my body and give me a\nsecond chance at life, or this was perhaps\nmy moment of transition.'
p118
aS"\nWhen I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked\nto discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,\nI said goodbye to my life.\nAnd my mind was now suspended between two very\nopposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in\nthrough my sensory systems felt like pure pain.\nLight burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds\nwere so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a\nvoice out from the background noise,\nand I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the\nposition of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive,\nlike a genie just liberated from her bottle.\nAnd my spirit soared free, like a great whale\ngliding through the sea of silent euphoria.\nNirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking,\nthere's no way I would ever be able to squeeze\nthe enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body."
p119
aS'\nBut then I realized, "But I\'m still alive! I\'m still alive,\nand I have found Nirvana. And if I have\nfound Nirvana and I\'m still alive, then everyone\nwho is alive can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world\nfilled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate,\nloving people who knew that they could come to\nthis space at any time. And that they could\npurposely choose to step to the right of their\nleft hemispheres and find this peace. And then\nI realized what a tremendous gift this experience\ncould be, what a stroke of insight this could be\nto how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover.'
p120
aS'\nTwo and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the\nsurgeons went in and they removed a blood clot\nthe size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers.\nHere I am with my mama,\nwho is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years to completely recover.'

aS'\nSo who are we? We are the life-force power of the universe,\nwith manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.\nAnd we have the power to choose, moment by moment,\nwho and how we want to be in the world.\nRight here, right now, I can step into the\nconsciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.\nI am the life-force power of the universe.\nI am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful\nmolecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is.\nOr, I can choose to step into the consciousness of\nmy left hemisphere, where I become a single individual,\na solid. Separate from the flow,\nseparate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:\nintellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me.\nWhich would you choose? Which do you choose? And when?\nI believe that the more time we spend\nchoosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry\nof our right hemispheres, the more peace we will\nproject into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.'

S'\nAlright. I\'m going to show you a couple of images\nfrom a very diverting paper\nin The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.\nI\'m going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper\never published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.\nThe title is "Observations of In-Utero Masturbation."\n(Laughter)\nOkay. Now on the left you can see the hand -- that\'s the big arrow --\nand the penis on the right. The hand hovering.\nAnd over here we have,\nin the words of radiologist Israel Meisner,\n"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements."\nBear in mind this was an ultrasound,\nso it would have been moving images.'
p125
aS"\nOrgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system.\nNow this is the part of the nervous system\nthat deals with the things that we don't consciously control,\nlike digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal.\nAnd the orgasm reflex can be triggered\nby a surprisingly broad range of input.\nGenital stimulation. Duh.\nBut also Kinsey interviewed a woman\nwho could be brought to orgasm\nby having someone stroke her eyebrow.\nPeople with spinal cord injuries,\nlike paraplegias, quadriplegias,\nwill often develop a very, very sensitive area\nright above the level of their injury,\nwherever that is.\nThere is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature."
p126
aS'\nI think the most curious one that I came across\nwas a case report of a woman\nwho had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth.\n(Laughter)\nThis was something in the complex\nsensory-motor action of brushing her teeth\nwas triggering orgasm.\nAnd she went to a neurologist who was fascinated.\nHe checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste,\nbut no -- it happened with any brand.\nThey stimulated her gums\nwith a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.\nNo. It was the whole, you know, motion.\nAnd the amazing thing to me is that\nnow you would think this woman would like have\nexcellent oral hygiene.\n(Laughter)\nSadly she -- this is what it said in the journal paper --\n"She believed that she was possessed by demons\nand switched to mouthwash for her oral care."\nIt\'s so sad.'
p127
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p128
aS'\nI interviewed, when I was working on the book,\nI interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm.\nShe was part of a study at Rutgers University.\nYou gotta love that. Rutgers.\nSo I interviewed her in Oakland,\nin a sushi restaurant.\nAnd I said, "So, could you do it right here?"\nAnd she said, "Yeah, but you know I\'d rather finish my meal if you don\'t mind."\n(Laughter)\nBut afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate\non a bench outside.\nIt was remarkable. It took about one minute.\nAnd I said to her,\n"Are you just doing this all the time?"\n(Laughter)\nShe said, "No. Honestly when I get home I\'m usually too tired."\n(Laughter)\nShe said that the last time she had done it\nwas on the Disneyland tram.'
p129
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p130
aS"\nThe headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve,\nis something called the sacral nerve root, which is back here.\nAnd if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode,\nthe precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.\nAnd it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes\nin dead people --\na certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.\nNow this is somebody who is brain-dead,\nlegally dead, definitely checked out,\nbut is being kept alive on a respirator,\nso that their organs will be oxygenated\nfor transplantation.\nNow in one of these brain-dead people,\nif you trigger the right spot,\nyou will see something every now and then.\nThere is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.\nAnd this is -- I'll demonstrate as best I can, not being dead.\nIt's like this. You trigger the spot.\nThe dead guy, or gal, goes ... like that.\nVery unsettling for people working in pathology labs."
p131
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p132
aS'\nNow if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,\nwhy not the orgasm reflex?\nI asked this question to a brain death expert,\nStephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.\n(Laughter)\nI said, "So, could you conceivably\ntrigger an orgasm in a dead person?"\nShe said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated,\nyou conceivably could."\nObviously it wouldn\'t be as much fun for the person.\nBut it would be an orgasm --\n(Laughter)\nnonetheless.\nI actually suggested to -- there is a researcher at the University of Alabama\nwho does orgasm research.\nI said to her, "You should do an experiment.\nYou know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."\nI said, "You should actually do this."\nShe said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."'
p133
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p134
aS'\nAccording to 1930s marriage manual author,\nTheodoor van de Velde,\na slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman\nwithin about an hour after sexual intercourse.\nTheodoor van de Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.\n(Laughter)\nThis is a guy writing a book, "Ideal Marriage," you know.\nVery heavy hetero guy.\nBut he wrote in this book, "Ideal Marriage" --\nhe said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man,\nwhich he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell,\nand the semen of mature men,\nwhose semen smelled quote,\n"Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut.\nSometimes quite freshly floral,\nand then again sometimes extremely pungent."'
p135
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p136
aS'\nOkay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,\na man began hiccupping.\nAnd this was one of those cases that went on and on.\nHe tried everything his friends suggested.\nNothing seemed to help.\nDays went by. At a certain point, the man,\nstill hiccupping, had sex with his wife.\nAnd lo and behold, the hiccups went away.\nHe told his doctor, who published a case report\nin a Canadian medical journal under the title,\n"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment\nfor Intractable Hiccups."\nI love this article because at a certain point they suggested\nthat unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation.\n(Laughter)\nI love that because there is like a whole demographic: unattached hiccuppers.\n(Laughter)\nMarried, single, unattached hiccupper.'
p137
aS'\nIn the 1900s, early 1900s\ngynecologists, a lot of gynecologists believed\nthat when a woman has an orgasm\nthe contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix\nand sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg,\nthereby upping the odds of conception.\nIt was called the "upsuck" theory.\n(Laughter)\nIf you go all the way back to Hippocrates,\nphysicians believed that orgasm in women was not just\nhelpful for conception, but necessary.\nDoctors back then were routinely telling men\nthe importance of pleasuring their wives.\nMarriage-manual author and semen-sniffer\nTheodoor van de Velde --\n(Laughter)\nhas a line in his book.\nI loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van de Velde.\nHe had this line in his book\nthat supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy,\nwhere there was an empress Maria Theresa,\nwho was having trouble conceiving.\nAnd apparently the royal court physician said to her,\n"I am of the opinion\nthat the vulva of your most sacred majesty\nbe titillated for some time prior to intercourse."\n(Laughter)\nIt\'s apparently, I don\'t know, on the record somewhere.'
p138
aS'\nMasters and Johnson: now we\'re moving forward to the 1950s.\nMasters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,\nwhich is also really fun to say.\nThey didn\'t buy it.\nAnd they decided, being Masters and Johnson,\nthat they would get to the bottom of it.\nThey brought women into the lab -- I think it was five women --\nand outfitted them with cervical caps\ncontaining artificial semen.\nAnd in the artificial semen\nwas a radio-opaque substance,\nsuch that it would show up on an X-ray.\nThis is the 1950s.\nAnyway these women sat in front of an X-ray device.\nAnd they masturbated.\nAnd Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.\nDid not find any evidence of upsuck.\nYou may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"\n(Laughter)\nI have an answer for you. I have two answers.\nYou can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water.\nI actually found three separate recipes in the literature.\n(Laughter)\nMy favorite being the one that says --\nyou know, they have the ingredients listed,\nand then in a recipe it will say, for example,\n"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."\nThis one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."'
p139
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p140
aS'\nThere\'s another way that orgasm might boost fertility.\nThis one involves men.\nSperm that sit around in the body for a week or more\nstart to develop abnormalities\nthat make them less effective at head-banging their way\ninto the egg.\nBritish sexologist Roy Levin\nhas speculated that this is perhaps why men\nevolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators.\nHe said, "If I keep tossing myself off\nI get fresh sperm being made."\nWhich I thought was an interesting idea, theory.\nSo now you have an evolutionary excuse.'
p141
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p142
aS'\nOkay.'
p143
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p144
aS'\nAlrighty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom --\npigs, for instance.\nIn Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production\nfound out that if you\nsexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her,\nyou will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate,\nwhich is the number of piglets produced.\nSo they came up with this plan, this five-point stimulation plan\nfor the sows.\nAnd they had the farmers -- there is posters they put in the barn,\nand they have a DVD.\nAnd I got a copy of this DVD.\n(Laughter)\nThis is my unveiling, because I am going to show you a clip.'
p145
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p146
aS'\nSo uh, okay.\nNow here we go in to the -- la la la, off to work.\nIt all looks very innocent.\nHe\'s going to be doing things with his hands\nthat the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay.\n(Laughter)\nThis is it. The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire.\n(Laughter)\nThis is to mimic the weight of the boar.\n(Laughter)\nYou should know, the clitoris of the pig, inside the vagina.\nSo this may be sort of titillating for her. Here we go.\n(Laughter)\nAnd the happy result.\n(Applause)\nI love this video.\nThere is a point in this video, towards the beginning\nwhere they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring,\nas if to say, "It\'s okay, it\'s just his job. He really does like women."'
p147
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p148
aS'\nOkay. Now I said -- when I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie.\nAnd I said, "So why don\'t you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig?\nWhy don\'t you have the farmers do that?\nThat\'s not one of your five steps."\nShe said -- I have to read you what she said, because I love it.\nShe said, "It was a big hurdle\njust to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva.\nSo we thought, let\'s not mention the clitoris right now."\n(Laughter)\nShy but ambitious pig farmers, however, can purchase a -- this is true --\na sow vibrator,\nthat hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.\nBecause, as I mentioned,\nthe clitoris is inside the vagina.\nSo possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks.\nAnd I also said to her,\n"Now these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there,\nThe sow doesn\'t look to be in the throes of ecstasy."\nAnd she said, you can\'t make that conclusion,\nbecause animals don\'t register\npain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do.\nThey tend to -- pigs, for example, are more like dogs.\nThey use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.\nSo you\'re not really sure what\'s going on with the pig.'
p149
aS'\nPrimates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more.\nThis is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque.\n(Laughter)\nAnd, interestingly, this has been observed in female macaques,\nbut only when mounting another female.'
p150
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p151
aS"\nMasters and Johnson, in the 1950s, they decided,\nokay, we're going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle,\nfrom arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women --\neverything that happens in the human body.\nOkay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside.\nThis did not stop Masters and Johnson.\nThey developed an artificial coition machine.\nThis is basically a penis camera on a motor.\nThere is a phallus,\nclear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source,\nattached to a motor that is kind of going like this.\nAnd the woman would have sex with it.\nThat is what they would do. Pretty amazing.\nSadly, this device has been dismantled.\nThis just kills me, not because I wanted to use it --\nI wanted to see it."
p152
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p153
aS"\nOne fine day\nAlfred Kinsey decided\nto calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen.\nThis was not idle curiosity.\nDoctor Kinsey had heard --\nand there was a theory kind of going around at the time, this being the 1940s --\nthat the force with which\nsemen is thrown against the cervix\nwas a factor in fertility.\nKinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.\nHe got together in his lab\n300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.\n(Laughter)\nAnd in fact he found\nthat in three quarters of the men\nthe stuff just kind of slopped out.\nIt wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.\nHowever, the record holder\nlanded just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nYes. Exactly.\n(Laughter)\nSadly, he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned."
p154
aS'\nIn his write-up,\nin his write-up of this experiment in his book,\nKinsey wrote,\n"Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets."\n(Laughter)\nWhich is my second favorite line\nin the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.\nMy favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats\nwill distract the female, but not the male."'

aS'\nThank you very much.'

p159
aa(lp160
S'\nWe grew up\ninteracting with the physical objects around us.\nThere are an enormous number of them\nthat we use every day.\nUnlike most of our computing devices,\nthese objects are much more fun to use.\nWhen you talk about objects,\none other thing automatically comes attached to that thing,\nand that is gestures:\nhow we manipulate these objects,\nhow we use these objects in everyday life.\nWe use gestures not only to interact with these objects,\nbut we also use them to interact with each other.\nA gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone,\nor maybe --\nin India I don\'t need to teach a kid that this means\n"four runs" in cricket.\nIt comes as a part of our everyday learning.'
p161
aS'\nSo, I am very interested,\nfrom the beginning, that how --\nhow our knowledge\nabout everyday objects and gestures,\nand how we use these objects,\ncan be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.\nRather than using a keyboard and mouse,\nwhy can I not use my computer\nin the same way that I interact in the physical world?'
p162
aS'\nSo, I started this exploration around eight years back,\nand it literally started with a mouse on my desk.\nRather than using it for my computer,\nI actually opened it.\nMost of you might be aware that, in those days,\nthe mouse used to come with a ball inside,\nand there were two rollers\nthat actually guide the computer where the ball is moving,\nand, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.\nSo, I was interested in these two rollers,\nand I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend --\nnever returned to him --\nand I now had four rollers.\nInterestingly, what I did with these rollers is,\nbasically, I took them off of these mouses\nand then put them in one line.\nIt had some strings and pulleys and some springs.\nWhat I got is basically a gesture interface device\nthat actually acts as a motion-sensing device\nmade for two dollars.\nSo, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world\nis actually replicated inside the digital world\njust using this small device that I made, around eight years back,\nin 2000.'
p163
aS'\nBecause I was interested in integrating these two worlds,\nI thought of sticky notes.\nI thought, "Why can I not connect\nthe normal interface of a physical sticky note\nto the digital world?"\nA message written on a sticky note to my mom\non paper\ncan come to an SMS,\nor maybe a meeting reminder\nautomatically syncs with my digital calendar --\na to-do list that automatically syncs with you.\nBut you can also search in the digital world,\nor maybe you can write a query, saying,\n"What is Dr. Smith\'s address?"\nand this small system actually prints it out --\nso it actually acts like a paper input-output system,\njust made out of paper.'
p164
aS"\nIn another exploration,\nI thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.\nSo, I implemented this pen\nthat can help designers and architects\nnot only think in three dimensions,\nbut they can actually draw\nso that it's more intuitive to use that way."
p165
aS'\nThen I thought, "Why not make a Google Map,\nbut in the physical world?"\nRather than typing a keyword to find something,\nI put my objects on top of it.\nIf I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.\nA coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee,\nor where you can trash the cup.'
p166
aS'\nSo, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because\nthe goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.\nAmong all these experiments,\nthere was one thing in common:\nI was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world.\nI was taking some part of the objects,\nor any of the intuitiveness of real life,\nand bringing them to the digital world,\nbecause the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.'
p167
aS'\nBut then I realized that we humans\nare not actually interested in computing.\nWhat we are interested in is information.\nWe want to know about things.\nWe want to know about dynamic things going around.'
p168
aS'\nSo I thought, around last year -- in the beginning of the last year --\nI started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"\nMaybe, "How about I take my digital world\nand paint the physical world with that digital information?"\nBecause pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices\nthat fit in our pockets.\nWhy can I not remove this confine\nand take that to my everyday objects, everyday life\nso that I don\'t need to learn the new language\nfor interacting with those pixels?'
p169
aS"\nSo, in order to realize this dream,\nI actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.\nI think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?\nI took it very literally,\nand took my bike helmet,\nput a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.\nSo now, what I can do --\nI can augment the world around me with this digital information."
p170
aS'\nBut later,\nI realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also.\nSo I put a small camera over there,\nthat acts as a digital eye.\nLater, we moved to a much better,\nconsumer-oriented pendant version of that,\nthat many of you now know as the SixthSense device.'
p171
aS"\nBut the most interesting thing about this particular technology\nis that you can carry your digital world with you\nwherever you go.\nYou can start using any surface, any wall around you,\nas an interface.\nThe camera is actually tracking all your gestures.\nWhatever you're doing with your hands,\nit's understanding that gesture.\nAnd, actually, if you see, there are some color markers\nthat in the beginning version we are using with it.\nYou can start painting on any wall.\nYou stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.\nBut we are not only tracking one finger, here.\nWe are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands,\nso you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out\nof a map just by pinching all present.\nThe camera is actually doing --\njust, getting all the images --\nis doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition\nand so many other small algorithms are going on inside.\nSo, technically, it's a little bit complex,\nbut it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense."
p172
aS"\nBut I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.\nRather than getting your camera out of your pocket,\nyou can just do the gesture of taking a photo\nand it takes a photo for you."
p173
aS'\n(Applause)'
p174
aS'\nThank you.'
p175
aS'\nAnd later I can find a wall, anywhere,\nand start browsing those photos\nor maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit\nand send it as an email to a friend."\nSo, we are looking for an era where\ncomputing will actually merge with the physical world.\nAnd, of course, if you don\'t have any surface,\nyou can start using your palm for simple operations.\nHere, I\'m dialing a phone number just using my hand.\nThe camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements,\nbut, interestingly,\nis also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.'
p176
aS'\nWhat we\'re doing here is actually --\nfor example, in this case,\nthe book cover is matched\nwith so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online,\nand checking out which book it is.\nOnce it has that information,\nit finds out more reviews about that,\nor maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that,\nso you can actually hear, on a physical book,\na review as sound.\n("famous talk at Harvard University ...")'
p177
aS'\nThis was Obama\'s visit last week to MIT.\n("... and particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT ...")\nSo, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk, outside, on just a newspaper.\nYour newspaper will show you live weather information\nrather than having it updated -- like, you have to check your computer\nin order to do that, right?'
p178
aS'\n(Applause)'
p179
aS"\nWhen I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass\nto check how much my flight has been delayed,\nbecause at that particular time,\nI'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,\nand checking out a particular icon.\nAnd I think this technology will not only change the way --\nyes. (Laughter)\nIt will change the way we interact with people, also,\nnot only the physical world.\nThe fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro,\nand playing a pong game inside the train\non the ground, right?\n(Laughter)\nAnd I think the imagination is the only limit\nof what you can think of\nwhen this kind of technology merges with real life."
p180
aS"\nBut many of you argue, actually, that\nall of our work is not only about physical objects.\nWe actually do lots of accounting and paper editing\nand all those kinds of things; what about that?\nAnd many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers\nto come out in the market.\nSo, rather than waiting for that,\nI actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.\nSo, what I did here is remove the camera --\nAll the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.\nI removed the microphone from that,\nand then just pinched that --\nlike I just made a clip out of the microphone --\nand clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.\nSo now the sound of the touch\nis getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.\nBut the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving."
p181
aS'\nYou can of course watch movies.\n("Good afternoon. My name is Russell ...\nand I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54.")'
p182
aS"\nAnd you can of course play games.\n(Car engine)\nHere, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper\nand playing a car-racing game.\n(Applause)"
p183
aS"\nMany of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.\nYeah. Of course you can browse to any websites\nor you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper\nwherever you need it.\nSo, more interestingly,\nI'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.\nWhen I come back to my desk I can just pinch that information\nback to my desktop\nso I can use my full-size computer."
p184
aS'\n(Applause)'
p185
aS'\nAnd why only computers? We can just play with papers.\nPaper world is interesting to play with.\nHere, I\'m taking a part of a document\nand putting over here a second part from a second place --\nand I\'m actually modifying the information\nthat I have over there.\nYeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,\nlet me print it out, that thing."\nSo I now have a print-out of that thing, and now --\nthe workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it\nmaybe 20 years back,\nrather than now switching between these two worlds.'
p186
aS'\nSo, as a last thought,\nI think that integrating information to everyday objects\nwill not only help us to get rid of the digital divide,\nthe gap between these two worlds,\nbut will also help us, in some way,\nto stay human,\nto be more connected to our physical world.\nAnd it will actually help us not end up being machines\nsitting in front of other machines.'

I want to know why you do what you do.'
p207
aS"\nWhat is your motive for action?\nWhat is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago.\nOr are you running the same pattern? Because I believe\nthat the invisible force of internal drive, activated,\nis the most important thing in the world.\nI'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life.\nAll of us here have great minds.\nYou know? Most of us here have great minds, right?\nI don't know about another category, but we all know how to think.\nAnd with our minds we can rationalize anything.\nWe can make anything happen. We can -- I agree with what was described\na few days ago, about this idea that people work in their self-interest."
p208
aS"\nBut we all know that that's bullshit at times.\nYou don't work in your self-interest all the time,\nbecause when emotion comes into it,\nthe wiring changes in the way it functions.\nAnd so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is, and especially\nthose who are very smart -- we can play this game in our head.\nBut I really want to know what's driving you."
p209
aS'\nAnd what I would like to maybe invite you to do\nby the end of this talk is explore where you are today,\nfor two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two:\nso that hopefully we can not just understand other people more,\nbut maybe appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections\nthat can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face in our society today.\nThey\'re only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that\'s connecting us,\nbecause it\'s making us intersect. And that intersection\ndoesn\'t always create the view of "everybody now understands everybody,\nand everybody appreciates everybody."'
p210
aS'\nSo, I\'ve had an obsession basically for 30 years, and that obsession has been,\n"What makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives?\nWhat makes the difference in their performance?"\nBecause that\'s what I got hired to do.\nI\'ve got to produce the result now.\nThat\'s what I\'ve done for 30 years. I get the phone call\nwhen the athlete is burning down on national television,\nand they were ahead by five strokes\nand now they can\'t get back on the course.\nAnd I\'ve got to do something right now to get the result\nor nothing matters. I get the phone call\nwhen the child is going commit suicide,\nand I\'ve got to do something right now. And in 29 years --\nI\'m very grateful to tell you I\'ve never lost one in 29 years.\nIt doesn\'t mean I won\'t some day. But I haven\'t done it,\nand the reason is an understanding of these human needs that I want to talk to you about.'
p211
aS'\nSo, when I get those calls about performance, that\'s one thing.\nHow do you make a change?\nBut also, I\'m looking to see what is it\nthat\'s shaping that person\'s ability to contribute,\nto do something beyond themselves. So maybe the real question is,\nyou know, I look at life and say, there\'s two master lessons.\nOne is: there\'s the science of achievement,\nwhich almost everything that\'s run is mastered to an amazing extent.\nThat\'s "How do you take the invisible and make it visible," right?\nHow do you take what you\'re dreaming of and make it happen?\nWhether it be your business, your contribution to society, money --\nwhatever it is for you -- your body, your family.'
p212
aS"\nBut the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment.\nBecause science is easy, right?\nWe know the rules. You write the code. You follow the --\nand you get the results. Once you know the game\nyou just, you know, you up the ante, don't you?\nBut when it comes to fulfillment -- that's an art.\nAnd the reason is, it's about appreciation\nand it's about contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself.\nSo, I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question\nof the real question, which is what's the difference\nin somebody's life if you look at somebody like those people\nthat you've given everything to? Like all the resources\nthey say they need. You gave them not a 100-dollar computer;\nyou gave them the best computer. You gave them love;\nyou gave them joy. You were there to comfort them.\nAnd those people very often -- and you know some of them, I'm sure --\nend up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money\nand background, spending their life going in and out of rehab.\nAnd then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain --\npsychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused --\nand not always, but often, they become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society."
p213
aS"\nSo, the question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it?\nWhat is it that shapes us? And we live in a therapy culture.\nMost of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture.\nAnd what I mean by that is the mindset that we are our past.\nAnd everybody in this room -- you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that theory --\nbut the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny.\nThe past equals the future. And of course it does if you live there.\nBut what people in this room know,\nand what we have to remind ourselves, though --\nbecause you can know something intellectually, you can know what to do\nand then not use it, not apply it."
p214
aS'\nSo really, we\'re going to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power. That\'s what it really is.\nNow, when you ask people, you know,\nhave you failed to achieve something?\nHow many have ever failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life? Say, "Aye."'
p215
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p216
aS'\nTR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there.\n(Laughter)'
p217
aS"\nBut if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something?\nSomebody who's working for you, you know, or a partner,\nor even yourself. When you fail to achieve a goal,\nwhat's the reason people say they fail to achieve?\nWhat do they tell you? Don't have the -- didn't know enough,\ndidn't have the -- knowledge. Didn't have the -- money.\nDidn't have the -- time. Didn't have the -- technology. You know,\nI didn't have the right manager. Didn't have the ..."
p218
aS'\nAl Gore: Supreme Court. (Laughter)'
p219
aS"\nTR: And --\n(Applause)\nand --\n(Applause)\n-- what do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?\n(Laughter)\nThey are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate.\nYou may not have the money; you may not have the Supreme Court;\nbut that is not the defining factor.\n(Applause)\nAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.\nThe defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness.\nAnd what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase,\nis if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced\nfrom you a day before yesterday at a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced, and if you'd communicated with that emotion\nI believe you would have beat his ass and won.\n(Applause)"
p220
aS'\nBut, how easy for me to tell him what he should do.\n(Laughter)\nIdiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time,\nthere were emotions that blocked people\'s ability\nto get this man\'s intellect and capacity.\nAnd the way that it came across to some people on that day --\nbecause I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn\'t,\nand I was upset. But there was emotion that was there.\nHow many know what I\'m talking about here? Say, "Aye."'
p221
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p222
aS"\nTR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything. We can get through it.\nIf you're creative enough, playful enough, fun enough,\ncan you get through to anybody? Yes or no?"
p223
aS'\nAudience: Yes.'
p224
aS"\nTR: If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined enough,\nyou find the way. So this is the ultimate resource.\nBut this is not the story that people tell us, right?\nThe story people tell us is a bunch of different stories.\nThey tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately,\nif you take a look here -- flip it up, if you would --\nthey say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that?\nNext one, please. He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.\n(Laughter)\nBut I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.\n(Laughter)"
p225
aS"\nWhat determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it\nis three decisions. What are you going to focus on?\nRight now, you have to decide what you're going to focus on.\nIn this second, consciously or unconsciously, the minute you decide\nto focus on something you've got to give it a meaning,\nand whatever that meaning is produces emotion.\nIs this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me\nor rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice?\nAn emotion, then, creates what we're going to do or the action."
p226
aS'\nSo, think about your own life,\nthe decisions that have shaped your destiny.\nAnd that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years,\n15 years, how have there been some decisions you\'ve made\nthat if you\'d made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different? How many can think about it?\nHonestly, better or worse? Say, "Aye."'
p227
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p228
aS'\nTR: So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work,\nand you met the love of your life there.\nMaybe it was a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here --\nI mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology at first. What if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture? How would the world be different?\nHow would their lives be different? Their impact?\nThe history of our world is these decisions.\nWhen a woman stands up and says, "No, I won\'t go to the back of the bus,"\nshe didn\'t just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture.\nOr someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong, and someone says to you,\n"You\'ve got testicular cancer." That\'s pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike.\n(Laughter)\nYou\'ve got it in your brain; you\'ve got it in your lungs.\nBut what was his decision of what to focus on?\nDifferent than most people. What did it mean?\nIt wasn\'t the end; it was the beginning. What am I going to do?\nHe goes off and wins seven championships he never once won\nbefore the cancer, because he got emotional fitness,\npsychological strength. That\'s the difference in human beings\nthat I\'ve seen of the three million that I\'ve been around.'
p229
aS'\nBecause that\'s about my lab. I\'ve had three million people\nfrom 80 different countries that I\'ve had a chance to interact with\nover the last 29 years. And after a while, patterns become obvious.\nYou see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right? Other people say,\n"Oh, that sounds ridiculous." It\'s simple. So, what shaped Lance?\nWhat shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state.\nWe all have had time.\nSo if you had a time you did something, and after you did it\nyou thought to yourself, I can\'t believe I said that,\nI can\'t believe I did that, that was so stupid -- who\'s been there?\nSay, "Aye."'
p230
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p231
aS'\nTR: Have you ever done something, after you did it, you go, "That was me!"\n(Laughter)\nRight? It wasn\'t your ability; it was your state.\nYour model of the world is what shapes you long term.\nYour model of the world is the filter. That\'s what\'s shaping us.\nThat\'s what makes people make decisions.\nWhen we want to influence somebody, we\'ve got to know\nwhat already influences them.\nAnd it\'s made up of three parts, I believe.\nFirst, what\'s your target? What are you after?\nWhich, I believe -- it\'s not your desires.\nYou can get your desires or goals. How many have ever got a goal\nor desire and thought, is this all there is?\nHow many have been there? Say, "Aye."'
p232
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p233
aS"\nTR: So, it's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs.\nSecond, once you know what the target that's driving you is\nand you uncover it for the truth -- you don't form it; you uncover it --\nthen you find out what's your map,\nwhat's the belief systems that are telling you how to get those needs.\nSome people think the way to get those needs is destroy the world,\nsome people is to build something, create something, love someone.\nAnd then there's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs."
p234
aS'\nLet me tell you what they are. First one: certainty.\nNow, these are not goals or desires, these are universal.\nEveryone needs certainty that they can avoid pain\nand at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it?\nControl everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette?\nAnd if you got totally certain, ironically,\neven though we all need that --\nlike if you\'re not certain about your health, or your children,\nor money, you don\'t think about much.\nYou\'re not sure if the ceiling\'s going to hold up,\nyou\'re not going to listen to any speaker.\nBut, while we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty,\nwe get what? What do you feel if you\'re certain?\nYou know what\'s going to happen, when it\'s going to happen,\nhow it\'s going to happen -- what would you feel?\nBored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,\n(Laughter)\ngave us a second human need, which is uncertainty.\nWe need variety. We need surprise.\nHow many of you here love surprises? Say, "Aye."'
p235
aS'\nAudience: Aye.'
p236
aS"\nTR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want.\n(Laughter)\nThe ones you don't want you call problems, but you need them.\nSo, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film\nthat you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life.\n(Laughter)\nAll right. Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good\nbecause you read it before, saw it before, but you're hoping\nit's been long enough you've forgotten, that there's variety."
p237
aS"\nThird human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel\nimportant, special, unique. You can get it by making more money.\nYou can do it by being more spiritual.\nYou can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put\nmore tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know.\nWhatever it takes. The fastest way to do this,\nif you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources\nor resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head\nand I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.\nZero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that\nyou're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty?\nWho knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting.\nLike climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff\nall the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty.\nAnd it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it.\nSo that's why violence has always been around and will be around\nunless we have a consciousness change as a species.\nNow, you can get significance a million ways,\nbut to be significant, you've got to be unique and different."
p238
aS'\nHere\'s what we really need: connection and love -- fourth need.\nWe all want it. Most people settle for connection\nbecause love\'s too scary. Don\'t want to get hurt.\nWho here has ever been hurt in an intimate relationship? Say, "Aye."\n(Laughter)\nIf you don\'t raise your hand, you\'ll have had other shit too, come on.\n(Laughter)\nAnd you\'re going to get hurt again.\nAren\'t you glad you came to this positive visit?\n(Laughter)\nBut here\'s what\'s true -- we need it. We can do it through intimacy,\nthrough friendship, through prayer, through walking in nature.\nIf nothing else works for you, get a dog. Don\'t get a cat. Get a dog,\nbecause if you leave for two minutes, it\'s like you\'ve been gone\nfor six months when you show back up again five minutes later, right?\n(Laughter)'
p239
aS"\nNow, these first four needs, every human finds a way to meet.\nEven if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities.\nBut the last two needs -- the first four needs are called\nthe needs of the personalities, is what I call it --\nthe last two are the needs of the spirit.\nAnd this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get fulfillment\nfrom the first four. You'll figure a way -- smoke, drink, do whatever --\nto meet the first four, but the last two -- number five:\nyou must grow. We all know the answer here.\nIf you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship's not growing,\nif a business is not growing, if you're not growing,\nit doesn't matter how much money you have,\nhow many friends you have, how many people love you,\nyou feel like hell. And the reason we grow, I believe,\nis so we have something to give of value."
p240
aS'\nBecause the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves.\nBecause we all know, corny as it sounds,\nthe secret to living is giving. We all know life\'s not about me;\nit\'s about we. This culture knows that. This room knows that.\nAnd it\'s exciting. When you see Nicholas up here talking about\nhis $100 computer, the most passionate exciting thing is:\nhere\'s a genius, but he\'s got a calling now.\nYou can feel the difference in him and it\'s beautiful.\nAnd that calling can touch other people. In my own life,\nmy life was touched because when I was 11 years old,\nThanksgiving, no money, no food -- we\'re not going to starve,\nbut my father was totally messed up. My mom was letting him know\nhow bad he messed up. And somebody came to the door\nand delivered food. My father made three decisions.\nI know what they were briefly. His focus was: "This is charity.\nWhat does it mean? I\'m worthless. What\'ve I got to do?\nLeave my family." Which he did. The time was one of the most painful\nexperiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path.\nI said, "Focus on: \'there\'s food\'" -- what a concept, you know.\n(Laughter)'
p241
aS'\nSecond -- but this is what changed my life,\nthis is what shaped me as a human being -- "Somebody\'s gift.\nI don\'t even know who it is." My father always said,\n"No one gives a shit." And all of a sudden, somebody I don\'t know,\nthey\'re not asking for anything, they\'re just giving our family food,\nlooking out for us. It made me believe this: "What does it mean\nthat strangers care?" And what that made me decide is,\nif strangers care about me and my family, I care about them.\nWhat am I going to do? I\'m going to do something\nto make a difference. So, when I was 17, I went out one day\non Thanksgiving. It was my target for years to\nhave enough money to feed two families.\nThe most fun thing I ever did in my life, the most moving.\nThen next year I did four. I didn\'t tell anybody what I was doing.\nNext year eight. I wasn\'t doing it for brownie points,\nbut after eight, I thought, shit, I could use some help.\n(Laughter)'
p242
aS"\nSo sure enough, I went out and what did I do?\nI got my friends involved and I grew companies\nand then I got 11 companies and I built the foundation.\nNow, 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you, last year\nwe fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation,\nall during the holidays: Thanksgiving, Christmas --\n(Applause)\n-- in all the different countries around the world.\nIt's been fantastic.\n(Applause)\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nSo, I don't tell you that to brag; I tell you because I'm proud\nof human beings, because they get excited to contribute\nonce they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it."
p243
aS'\nSo, finally -- and I\'m about out of time -- the target that shapes you --\nhere\'s what\'s different about people. We have the same needs,\nbut are you a certainty freak? Is that what you value most,\nor uncertainty? This man here couldn\'t be a certainty freak\nif he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance\nor love? We all need all six, but whatever\nyour lead system is, tilts you in a different direction.\nAnd as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny.\nThe second piece is the map. Think of that as the operating system\nthat tells you how to get there. And some people\'s map is:\n"I\'m going to save lives even if I die for other people,"\nand they\'re firemen. Somebody else is:\n"I\'m going to kill people to do it." They\'re trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance, right? They want to honor God\nor honor their family, but they have a different map.'
p244
aS"\nAnd there are seven different beliefs. I can't go through them\nbecause I'm done. The last piece is emotion.\nI'd say one of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have.\n(Laughter)\nAnd the last one I've already mentioned, that fell to you.\nIf you've got a target and you've got a map and let's say --\nI can't use Google because I love Macs and they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet -- so if you use MapQuest -- how many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using MapQuest at some time?\n(Laughter)\nYou use this thing and you don't get there. Well, imagine\nif your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go?\n(Laughter)"
p245
aS'\nThe last thing is emotion.\nNow, here\'s what I\'ll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions\nthat we all have words for in the English language,\nwhich is just a linguistic representation, right,\nthat changes by language. But if your dominant emotions --\nif I had more time, I have 20,000 people or 1,000,\nand I have them write down all the emotions that they experience\nin an average week, and I gave them as long as they needed,\nand on one side they write empowering emotions,\nthe other\'s disempowering --\nguess how many emotions people experience? Less than 12.\nAnd half of those make them feel like shit. So they got five or six\ngood frickin\' feelings, right? It\'s like they feel "happy, happy,\nexcited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed."\nHow many of you know somebody who no matter what happens\nfinds a way to get pissed off? How many know somebody like this?\n(Laughter)\nOr, no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited.\nHow may know somebody like this? Come on.'
p246
aS'\nWhen 9/11 happened -- I\'ll finish with this -- I was in Hawaii.\nI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries. We were translating\nfour languages simultaneously for a program\nthat I was conducting for a week. The night before was called\n"Emotional Mastering." I got up, had no plan for the this, and I said --\nwe had all these fireworks -- I do crazy shit, fun stuff --\nand then at the end I stopped -- I had this plan I was going to say\nbut I never do what I\'m going to say. And all of a sudden I said,\n"When do people really start to live? When they face death."\nAnd then I went through this whole thing about,\nif you weren\'t going to get off this island, if nine days from now\nyou were going to die, who would you call, what would you say,\nwhat would you do? One woman -- well, that night is when 9/11 happened --\none woman had come to the seminar and when she came there,\nher previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered.\nHer friend, her new boyfriend, wanted to marry her, and she said no.'
p247
aS'\nHe said, "If you leave and go to that Hawaii thing, it\'s over with us."\nShe said, "It\'s over." When I finished that night, she called him\nand left a message -- true story -- at the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying, "Honey, I love you, I just want you to know\nI want to marry you. It was stupid of me." She was asleep,\nbecause it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back\nfrom the top and said, "Honey, I can\'t tell you what this means."\nHe said, "I don\'t know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift because I\'m going to die."\nAnd she played the recording for us in the room.\nShe was on Larry King later, and he said, "You\'re probably wondering\nhow on Earth this could happen to you twice." And he said,\n"All I can say to you is, this must be God\'s message to you,\nhoney. From now on, every day give your all, love your all.\nDon\'t let anything ever stop you." She finishes, and a man stands up\nand he says, "I\'m from Pakistan; I\'m a Muslim.\nI\'d love to hold your hand and say\nI\'m sorry, but, frankly, this is retribution." I can\'t tell you the rest\nbecause I\'m out of time.\n(Laughter)\n10 seconds.\n(Applause)'
p248
aS'\n10 seconds, that\'s all. I want to be respectful. 10 seconds.\nAll I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage\nwith a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center,\nbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50\nlost their entire companies, their friends, marking off their\nPalm Pilots -- one financial trader, this woman made of steel, bawling --\n30 friends crossing off that all died.\nAnd what I did to people is said, "What are we going to focus on?\nWhat does this mean and what are we going to do?"'
p249
aS'\nAnd I took the group and got people to focus on:\nif you didn\'t lose somebody today, your focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else. There are people --\nthen one woman got up and she was so angry and screaming and yelling.\nThen I found out she wasn\'t from New York; she\'s not an American;\nshe doesn\'t know anybody here. I said, "Do you always get angry?"\nShe said, "Yes." Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.\nAnd I took these two men and did what I call an indirect negotiation.\nJewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in New York\nwho would have died if he was at work that day, and this man\nwho wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear.\nAnd the integration that happened is on a film,\nwhich I\'ll be happy to send you, so you can really see\nwhat actually happened instead of my verbalization of it,\nbut the two of them not only came together and\nchanged their beliefs and morals of the world,\nbut they worked together to bring, for almost four years now,\nthrough various mosques and synagogues, the idea\nof how to create peace. And he wrote a book, which is called\n"My Jihad, My Way of Peace." So, transformation can happen.'
p250
aS"\nSo my invitation to you is this: explore your web, the web in here --\nthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you,\nfor two reasons: so there's more of you to give -- and achieve too,\nwe all want to do it -- but I mean give,\nbecause that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly,\nso you can appreciate -- not just understand, that's intellectual,\nthat's the mind -- but appreciate what's driving other people.\nIt's the only way our world's going to change. God bless you.\nThank you. I hope this was of service.\n(Applause)"

S"\nI need to make a confession at the outset here.\nA little over 20 years ago\nI did something that I regret,\nsomething that I'm not particularly proud of,\nsomething that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,\nbut here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.\n(Laughter)\nIn the late 1980s,\nin a moment of youthful indiscretion,\nI went to law school.\n(Laughter)"
p253
aS"\nNow, in America law is a professional degree:\nyou get your university degree, then you go on to law school.\nAnd when I got to law school,\nI didn't do very well.\nTo put it mildly, I didn't do very well.\nI, in fact, graduated in the part of my law school class\nthat made the top 90 percent possible.\n(Laughter)\nThank you.\nI never practiced law a day in my life;\nI pretty much wasn't allowed to.\n(Laughter)"
p254
aS"\nBut today, against my better judgment,\nagainst the advice of my own wife,\nI want to try to dust off some of those legal skills --\nwhat's left of those legal skills.\nI don't want to tell you a story.\nI want to make a case.\nI want to make a hard-headed, evidence-based,\ndare I say lawyerly case,\nfor rethinking how we run our businesses."
p255
aS'\nSo, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, take a look at this.\nThis is called the candle problem.\nSome of you might have seen this before.\nIt\'s created in 1945\nby a psychologist named Karl Duncker.\nKarl Duncker created this experiment\nthat is used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science.\nAnd here\'s how it works. Suppose I\'m the experimenter.\nI bring you into a room. I give you a candle,\nsome thumbtacks and some matches.\nAnd I say to you, "Your job\nis to attach the candle to the wall\nso the wax doesn\'t drip onto the table." Now what would you do?'

aS"\nNow many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.\nDoesn't work.\nSomebody, some people -- and I saw somebody\nkind of make the motion over here --\nsome people have a great idea where they\nlight the match, melt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.\nIt's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.\nAnd eventually, after five or 10 minutes,\nmost people figure out the solution,\nwhich you can see here.\nThe key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.\nYou look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.\nBut it can also have this other function,\nas a platform for the candle. The candle problem."
p257
aS'\nNow I want to tell you about an experiment\nusing the candle problem,\ndone by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,\nwho is now at Princeton University in the U.S.\nThis shows the power of incentives.\nHere\'s what he did. He gathered his participants.\nAnd he said, "I\'m going to time you. How quickly you can solve this problem?"\nTo one group he said,\n"I\'m going to time you to establish norms,\naverages for how long it typically takes\nsomeone to solve this sort of problem."'
p258
aS'\nTo the second group he offered rewards.\nHe said, "If you\'re in the top 25 percent of the fastest times,\nyou get five dollars.\nIf you\'re the fastest of everyone we\'re testing here today,\nyou get 20 dollars."\nNow this is several years ago. Adjusted for inflation,\nit\'s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.\nIt\'s a nice motivator.'
p259
aS"\nQuestion: How much faster\ndid this group solve the problem?\nAnswer: It took them, on average,\nthree and a half minutes longer.\nThree and a half minutes longer. Now this makes no sense right?\nI mean, I'm an American. I believe in free markets.\nThat's not how it's supposed to work. Right?\n(Laughter)\nIf you want people to perform better,\nyou reward them. Right?\nBonuses, commissions, their own reality show.\nIncentivize them. That's how business works.\nBut that's not happening here.\nYou've got an incentive designed to\nsharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,\nand it does just the opposite.\nIt dulls thinking and blocks creativity."
p260
aS"\nAnd what's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration.\nThis has been replicated over and over\nand over again, for nearly 40 years.\nThese contingent motivators --\nif you do this, then you get that --\nwork in some circumstances.\nBut for a lot of tasks, they actually either don't work\nor, often, they do harm.\nThis is one of the most robust findings\nin social science,\nand also one of the most ignored."
p261
aS"\nI spent the last couple of years looking at the science of\nhuman motivation,\nparticularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators\nand intrinsic motivators.\nAnd I'm telling you, it's not even close.\nIf you look at the science, there is a mismatch\nbetween what science knows and what business does.\nAnd what's alarming here is that our business operating system --\nthink of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses,\nhow we motivate people, how we apply our human resources --\nit's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators,\naround carrots and sticks.\nThat's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.\nBut for 21st century tasks,\nthat mechanistic, reward-and-punishment approach\ndoesn't work, often doesn't work, and often does harm.\nLet me show you what I mean."
p262
aS"\nSo Glucksberg did another experiment similar to this\nwhere he presented the problem in a slightly different way,\nlike this up here. Okay?\nAttach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.\nSame deal. You: we're timing for norms.\nYou: we're incentivizing.\nWhat happened this time?\nThis time, the incentivized group\nkicked the other group's butt.\nWhy? Because when the tacks are out of the box,\nit's pretty easy isn't it?\n(Laughter)"
p263
aS"\nIf-then rewards work really well\nfor those sorts of tasks,\nwhere there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination\nto go to.\nRewards, by their very nature,\nnarrow our focus, concentrate the mind;\nthat's why they work in so many cases.\nAnd so, for tasks like this,\na narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there,\nzoom straight ahead to it,\nthey work really well.\nBut for the real candle problem,\nyou don't want to be looking like this.\nThe solution is not over here. The solution is on the periphery.\nYou want to be looking around.\nThat reward actually narrows our focus\nand restricts our possibility."
p264
aS'\nLet me tell you why this is so important.\nIn western Europe,\nin many parts of Asia,\nin North America, in Australia,\nwhite-collar workers are doing less of\nthis kind of work,\nand more of this kind of work.\nThat routine, rule-based, left-brain work --\ncertain kinds of accounting, certain kinds of financial analysis,\ncertain kinds of computer programming --\nhas become fairly easy to outsource,\nfairly easy to automate.\nSoftware can do it faster.\nLow-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper.\nSo what really matters are the more right-brained\ncreative, conceptual kinds of abilities.'
p265
aS"\nThink about your own work.\nThink about your own work.\nAre the problems that you face, or even the problems\nwe've been talking about here,\nare those kinds of problems -- do they have a clear set of rules,\nand a single solution? No.\nThe rules are mystifying.\nThe solution, if it exists at all,\nis surprising and not obvious.\nEverybody in this room\nis dealing with their own version\nof the candle problem.\nAnd for candle problems of any kind,\nin any field,\nthose if-then rewards,\nthe things around which we've built so many of our businesses,\ndon't work."
p266
aS"\nNow, I mean it makes me crazy.\nAnd this is not -- here's the thing.\nThis is not a feeling.\nOkay? I'm a lawyer; I don't believe in feelings.\nThis is not a philosophy.\nI'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy.\n(Laughter)\nThis is a fact --\nor, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C.,\na true fact.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nLet me give you an example of what I mean.\nLet me marshal the evidence here,\nbecause I'm not telling you a story, I'm making a case."
p267
aS'\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, some evidence:\nDan Ariely, one of the great economists of our time,\nhe and three colleagues, did a study of some MIT students.\nThey gave these MIT students a bunch of games,\ngames that involved creativity,\nand motor skills, and concentration.\nAnd the offered them, for performance,\nthree levels of rewards:\nsmall reward, medium reward, large reward.\nOkay? If you do really well you get the large reward, on down.\nWhat happened? As long as the task involved only mechanical skill\nbonuses worked as they would be expected:\nthe higher the pay, the better the performance.\nOkay? But one the task called for\neven rudimentary cognitive skill,\na larger reward led to poorer performance.'
p268
aS'\nThen they said,\n"Okay let\'s see if there\'s any cultural bias here.\nLets go to Madurai, India and test this."\nStandard of living is lower.\nIn Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,\nis more meaningful there.\nSame deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.\nWhat happens?\nPeople offered the medium level of rewards\ndid no better than people offered the small rewards.\nBut this time, people offered the highest rewards,\nthey did the worst of all.\nIn eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,\nhigher incentives led to worse performance.'
p269
aS"\nIs this some kind of touchy-feely\nsocialist conspiracy going on here?\nNo. These are economists from MIT,\nfrom Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.\nAnd do you know who sponsored this research?\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.\nThat's the American experience."
p270
aS'\nLet\'s go across the pond to the London School of Economics --\nLSE, London School of Economics,\nalma mater of 11 Nobel Laureates in economics.\nTraining ground for great economic thinkers\nlike George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,\nand Mick Jagger. (Laughter)\nLast month, just last month,\neconomists at LSE looked at 51 studies\nof pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.\nHere\'s what the economists there said: "We find that financial incentives\ncan result in a negative impact on overall performance."'
p271
aS'\nThere is a mismatch between what science knows\nand what business does.\nAnd what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble\nof the economic collapse,\nis that too many organizations\nare making their decisions,\ntheir policies about talent and people,\nbased on assumptions that are outdated, unexamined,\nand rooted more in folklore than in science.\nAnd if we really want to get out of this economic mess,\nand if we really want high performance on those\ndefinitional tasks of the 21st century,\nthe solution is not to do more of the wrong things,\nto entice people with a sweeter carrot,\nor threaten them with a sharper stick.\nWe need a whole new approach.'
p272
aS"\nAnd the good news about all of this is that the scientists\nwho've been studying motivation have given us this new approach.\nIt's an approach built much more around intrinsic motivation.\nAround the desire to do things because they matter,\nbecause we like it, because they're interesting,\nbecause they are part of something important.\nAnd to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses\nrevolves around three elements:\nautonomy, mastery and purpose.\nAutonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.\nMastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.\nPurpose: the yearning to do what we do\nin the service of something larger than ourselves.\nThese are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system\nfor our businesses."
p273
aS"\nI want to talk today only about autonomy.\nIn the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.\nManagement did not emanate from nature.\nManagement is like -- it's not a tree,\nit's a television set.\nOkay? Somebody invented it.\nAnd it doesn't mean it's going to work forever.\nManagement is great.\nTraditional notions of management are great\nif you want compliance.\nBut if you want engagement, self-direction works better."
p274
aS"\nLet me give you some examples of some kind of radical\nnotions of self-direction.\nWhat this means -- you don't see a lot of it,\nbut you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on,\nbecause what it means is paying people adequately\nand fairly, absolutely --\ngetting the issue of money off the table,\nand then giving people lots of autonomy.\nLet me give you some examples."
p275
aS'\nHow many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?\nIt looks like less than half.\n(Laughter)\nAtlassian is an Australian software company.\nAnd they do something incredibly cool.\nA few times a year they tell their engineers,\n"Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,\nas long as it\'s not part of your regular job.\nWork on anything you want."\nSo that engineers use this time to come up with\na cool patch for code, come up with an elegant hack.\nThen they present all of the stuff that they\'ve developed\nto their teammates, to the rest of the company,\nin this wild and wooly all-hands meeting\nat the end of the day.\nAnd then, being Australians, everybody has a beer.'
p276
aS"\nThey call them FedEx Days.\nWhy? Because you have to deliver something overnight.\nIt's pretty. It's not bad. It's a huge trademark violation,\nbut it's pretty clever.\n(Laughter)\nThat one day of intense autonomy\nhas produced a whole array of software fixes\nthat might never have existed."
p277
aS"\nAnd it's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level\nwith 20 Percent Time --\ndone, famously, at Google --\nwhere engineers can work, spend 20 percent of their time\nworking on anything they want.\nThey have autonomy over their time,\ntheir task, their team, their technique.\nOkay? Radical amounts of autonomy.\nAnd at Google, as many of you know,\nabout half of the new products in a typical year\nare birthed during that 20 Percent Time:\nthings like Gmail, Orkut, Google News."
p278
aS"\nLet me give you an even more radical example of it:\nsomething called the Results Only Work Environment,\nthe ROWE,\ncreated by two American consultants, in place\nin place at about a dozen companies around North America.\nIn a ROWE people don't have schedules.\nThey show up when they want.\nThey don't have to be in the office at a certain time,\nor any time.\nThey just have to get their work done.\nHow they do it, when they do it,\nwhere they do it, is totally up to them.\nMeetings in these kinds of environments are optional."
p279
aS'\nWhat happens?\nAlmost across the board, productivity goes up,\nworker engagement goes up,\nworker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.\nAutonomy, mastery and purpose,\nThese are the building blocks of a new way of doing things.\nNow some of you might look at this and say,\n"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it\'s Utopian."\nAnd I say, "Nope. I have proof."'
p280
aS'\nThe mid-1990s, Microsoft started\nan encyclopedia called Encarta.\nThey had deployed all the right incentives,\nall the right incentives. They paid professionals to\nwrite and edit thousands of articles.\nWell-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing\nto make sure it came in on budget and on time.\nA few years later another encyclopedia got started.\nDifferent model, right?\nDo it for fun. No one gets paid a cent, or a Euro or a Yen.\nDo it because you like to do it.'
p281
aS'\nNow if you had, just 10 years ago,\nif you had gone to an economist, anywhere,\nand said, "Hey, I\'ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.\nIf they went head to head, who would win?"\n10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere\non planet Earth\nwho would have predicted the Wikipedia model.'
p282
aS"\nThis is the titanic battle between these two approaches.\nThis is the Ali-Frazier of motivation. Right?\nThis is the Thrilla' in Manila.\nAlright? Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.\nAutonomy, mastery and purpose,\nversus carrot and sticks. And who wins?\nIntrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery and purpose,\nin a knockout. Let me wrap up."
p283
aS"\nThere is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.\nAnd here is what science knows.\nOne: Those 20th century rewards,\nthose motivators we think are a natural part of business,\ndo work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.\nTwo: Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.\nThree: The secret to high performance\nisn't rewards and punishments,\nbut that unseen intrinsic drive --\nthe drive to do things for their own sake.\nThe drive to do things cause they matter."
p284
aS"\nAnd here's the best part. Here's the best part.\nWe already know this. The science confirms what we know in our hearts.\nSo, if we repair this mismatch\nbetween what science knows and what business does,\nif we bring our motivation, notions of motivation\ninto the 21st century,\nif we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology\nof carrots and sticks,\nwe can strengthen our businesses,\nwe can solve a lot of those candle problems,\nand maybe, maybe, maybe\nwe can change the world.\nI rest my case.\n(Applause)"

S"\nWe're going to go on a dive to the deep sea,\nand anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows\nthat for about two and half hours on the way down,\nit's a perfectly positively pitch-black world.\nAnd we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window\nthat you couldn't describe: these blinking lights --\na world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.\nDr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association --\nwas able to come up with a camera\nthat could capture some of these incredible animals,\nand that's what you're seeing here on the screen."
p287
aS"\nThat's all bioluminescence. So, like I said: just like fireflies.\nThere's a flying turkey under a tree. (Laughter)\nI'm a geologist by training. But I love that.\nAnd you see, some of the bioluminescence\nthey use to avoid being eaten,\nsome they use to attract prey,\nbut all of it, from an artistic point of view, is positively amazing.\nAnd a lot of what goes on inside ...\nthere's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.\nSome of the colors are designed to hypnotize,\nthese lovely patterns. And then this last one,\none of my favorites, this pinwheel design.\nJust absolutely amazing, every single dive."
p288
aS"\nThat's the unknown world, and today we've only explored about 3 percent\nof what's out there in the ocean.\nAlready we've found the world's highest mountains,\nthe world's deepest valleys,\nunderwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --\na lot of that we shared with you from the stage.\nAnd in a place where we thought no life at all,\nwe find more life, we think, and diversity and density\nthan the tropical rainforest, which tells us that\nwe don't know much about this planet at all.\nThere's still 97 percent, and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises."
p289
aS"\nBut I want to jump up to shallow water now\nand look at some creatures that are positively amazing.\nCephalopods -- head-foots. As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly. (Laughter)\nThis is an octopus --\nthis is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab --\nand it's just fascinating how cephalopods can,\nwith their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings,\nlook at light, look at patterns.\nHere's an octopus moving across the reef,\nfinds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background.\nTough thing to do."
p290
aS"\nIn the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid.\nThese are squid. Now males, when they fight,\nif they're really aggressive, they turn white.\nAnd these two males are fighting,\nthey do it by bouncing their butts together,\nwhich is an interesting concept. Now, here's a male on the left\nand a female on the right,\nand the male has managed to split his coloration\nso the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him.\nAnd the male ... (Laughter) We're going to see it again.\nLet's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration:\nwhite on the right, brown on the left.\nHe takes a step back -- so he's keeping off the other males\nby splitting his body -- and comes up on the other side ...\nBingo! Now I'm told that's\nnot just a squid phenomenon with males, but I don't know.\n(Laughter)"
p291
aS"\nCuttlefish. I love cuttlefish. This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.\nAnd there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.\nBut they can do pretty amazing things, too.\nHere we're going to see one backing into a crevice, and\nwatch his tentacles --\nhe just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.\nDisappears right into the background.\nPositively amazing. Here's two males fighting.\nOnce again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods;\nthey know not to hurt each other.\nBut look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.\nThat's an amazing thing."
p292
aS"\nHere's an octopus. Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move\nbecause predators can see them.\nHere, this guy actually can make himself look like a rock,\nand, looking at his environment,\ncan actually slide across the bottom,\nusing the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen.\nHis motion blends right into the background --\nthe moving rock trick. So, we're learning lots new from the shallow water.\nStill exploring the deep,\nbut learning lots from the shallow water.\nThere's a good reason why: the shallow water's\nfull of predators -- here's a barracuda --\nand if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,\nyou need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide."
p293
aS'\nIn the next scene, you\'re going to see a nice coral bottom.\nAnd you see that an octopus would stand out\nvery easily there if you couldn\'t use your camouflage,\nuse your skin to change color and texture.\nHere\'s some algae in the foreground ...\nand an octopus. Ain\'t that amazing? Now, Roger spooked him\nso he took off in a cloud of ink, and when he\nlands the octopus says, "Oh, I\'ve been seen.\nThe best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."\nThat big brown makes his eyespot very big.\nSo, he\'s bluffing. Let\'s do it backwards --\nI thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.\nI thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse.\nWatch the skin color; watch the skin texture.\nJust an amazing animal, it can change color and texture\nto match the surroundings. Watch him blend right into this algae.\nOne, two, three. (Applause)\nAnd now he\'s gone, and so am I. Thank you very much.'

S'\nWhen you have 21 minutes to speak,\ntwo million years seems like a really long time.\nBut evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.\nAnd yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass,\ngoing from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,\nto the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears.\nWhat is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?'
p296
aS'\nWell, it turns out when brains triple in size,\nthey don\'t just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.\nAnd one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part,\ncalled the "frontal lobe." And particularly, a part called the "pre-frontal cortex."\nNow what does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify\nthe entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time?'
p297
aS"\nWell, it turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things,\nbut one of the most important things it does\nis it is an experience simulator.\nFlight pilots practice in flight simulators\nso that they don't make real mistakes in planes.\nHuman beings have this marvelous adaptation\nthat they can actually have experiences in their heads\nbefore they try them out in real life.\nThis is a trick that none of our ancestors could do,\nand that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation.\nIt's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language\nas one of the things that got our species out of the trees\nand into the shopping mall."
p298
aS'\nNow -- (Laughter) -- all of you have done this.\nI mean, you know,\nBen and Jerry\'s doesn\'t have liver-and-onion ice cream,\nand it\'s not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."\nIt\'s because, without leaving your armchair,\nyou can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.'
p299
aS"\nLet's see how your experience simulators are working.\nLet's just run a quick diagnostic \nbefore I proceed with the rest of the talk.\nHere's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate,\nand you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.\nOne of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.\nAnd the other is becoming paraplegic.\nSo, just give it a moment of thought.\nYou probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought."
p300
aS"\nInterestingly, there are data on these two groups of people,\ndata on how happy they are.\nAnd this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?\nBut these aren't the data. I made these up!"
p301
aS"\nThese are the data. You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.\nBecause the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs,\nand a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics\nare equally happy with their lives."
p302
aS'\nNow, don\'t feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz,\nbecause everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.\nThe research that my laboratory has been doing,\nthat economists and psychologists around the country have been doing,\nhave revealed something really quite startling to us,\nsomething we call the "impact bias,"\nwhich is the tendency for the simulator to work badly.\nFor the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes\nare more different than in fact they really are.'
p303
aS'\nFrom field studies to laboratory studies,\nwe see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner,\ngetting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test,\non and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration\nthan people expect them to have.\nIn fact, a recent study -- this almost floors me --\na recent study showing how major life traumas affect people\nsuggests that if it happened over three months ago,\nwith only a few exceptions,\nit has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.'
p304
aS'\nWhy?\nBecause happiness can be synthesized.\nSir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.\nI have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity.\nI am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."\nWhat kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?'
p305
aS'\nWell, it turns out it\'s precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.\nHuman beings have something that we might think of as a "psychological immune system."\nA system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes,\nthat help them change their views of the world,\nso that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves.\nLike Sir Thomas, you have this machine.\nUnlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it. (Laughter)'
p306
aS"\nWe synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.\nNow, you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness,\nI suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence,\nyou don't have to look very far for evidence."
p307
aS'\nAs a challenge to myself, since I say this once in a while in lectures,\nI took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.\nAnd here are three guys synthesizing happiness.\n"I am so much better off physically, financially, emotionally, mentally\nand almost every other way." "I don\'t have one minute\'s regret.\nIt was a glorious experience." "I believe it turned out for the best."'
p308
aS'\nWho are these characters who are so damn happy?\nWell, the first one is Jim Wright.\nSome of you are old enough to remember: he was the chairman of the House of Representatives\nand he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich\nfound out about a shady book deal he had done.\nHe lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country,\nhe lost everything.\nHe lost his money; he lost his power.\nWhat does he have to say all these years later about it?\n"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally\nand in almost every other way."\nWhat other way would there be to be better off?\nVegetably? Minerally? Animally? He\'s pretty much covered them there.'
p309
aS'\nMoreese Bickham is somebody you\'ve never heard of.\nMoreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.\nHe was 78 years old. He spent 37 years\nin a Louisiana State Penitentiary \nfor a crime he didn\'t commit.\n[He was ultimately\nreleased for good behavior \nhalfway through his sentence.]\nAnd what did he have to say about his experience?\n"I don\'t have one minute\'s regret. It was a glorious experience."\nGlorious! This guy is not saying,\n"Well, you know, there were some nice guys. They had a gym."\nIt\'s "glorious,"\na word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.'
p310
aS'\nHarry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he\'s somebody you might have known\nbut didn\'t, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper\nabout a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonalds.\nAnd he thought, "That\'s a really neat idea!"\nSo he went to find them. They said,\n"We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."\nHarry went back to New York, asked his brother who\'s an investment banker\nto loan him the 3,000 dollars,\nand his brother\'s immortal words were,\n"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."\nHe wouldn\'t lend him the money, and of course six months later\nRay Croc had exactly the same idea.\nIt turns out people do eat hamburgers,\nand Ray Croc, for a while, became the richest man in America.'
p311
aS'\nAnd then finally -- you know, the best of all possible worlds --\nsome of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best,\nwho was the original drummer for the Beatles,\nuntil they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away\nand picked up Ringo on a tour.\nWell, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed\n-- yes, he\'s still a drummer; yes, he\'s a studio musician --\nhe had this to say: "I\'m happier than I would have been with the Beatles."'
p312
aS"\nOkay. There's something important to be learned from these people,\nand it is the secret of happiness.\nHere it is, finally to be revealed.\nFirst: accrue wealth, power, and prestige,\nthen lose it. (Laughter)\nSecond: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.\n(Laughter) Third: make somebody else really, really rich. (Laughter)\nAnd finally: never ever join the Beatles. (Laughter)"
p313
aS'\nOK. Now I, like Ze Frank, can predict your next thought,\nwhich is, "Yeah, right." Because when\npeople synthesize happiness, as these gentlemen seem to have done,\nwe all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say,\n"Yeah right, you never really wanted the job."\n"Oh yeah, right. You really didn\'t\nhave that much in common with her,\nand you figured that out just about the time\nshe threw the engagement ring in your face."'
p314
aS'\nWe smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness\nis not of the same quality as what we might call "natural happiness."\nWhat are these terms?\nNatural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted,\nand synthetic happiness is what we make when we don\'t get what we wanted.\nAnd in our society, we have a strong belief\nthat synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.\nWhy do we have that belief?\nWell, it\'s very simple. What kind of economic engine\nwould keep churning\nif we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it?'

aS"\nWith all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard,\na shopping mall full of Zen monks\nis not going to be particularly profitable\nbecause they don't want stuff enough.\nI want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness\nis every bit as real and enduring\nas the kind of happiness you stumble upon\nwhen you get exactly what you were aiming for.\nNow, I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric,\nbut by marinating you in a little bit of data."
p316
aS'\nLet me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used\nto demonstrate the synthesis of happiness\namong regular old folks. And this isn\'t mine.\nThis is a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."\nIt\'s very simple.\nYou bring in, say, six objects,\nand you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.\nIn this case, because the experiment I\'m going to tell you about uses them,\nthese are Monet prints.\nSo, everybody can rank these Monet prints\nfrom the one they like the most, to the one they like the least.\nNow we give you a choice:\n"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.\nWe\'re going to give you one as your prize to take home.\nWe happen to have number three and number four,"\nwe tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice,\nbecause neither one is preferred strongly to the other,\nbut naturally, people tend to pick number three\nbecause they liked it a little better than number four.'
p317
aS'\nSometime later -- it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days --\nthe same stimuli are put before the subject,\nand the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.\n"Tell us how much you like them now."\nWhat happens? Watch as happiness is synthesized.\nThis is the result that has been replicated over and over again.\nYou\'re watching happiness be synthesized.\nWould you like to see it again? Happiness!\n"The one I got is really better than I thought!\nThat other one I didn\'t get sucks!"\n(Laughter) That\'s the synthesis of happiness.'
p318
aS'\nNow what\'s the right response to that? "Yeah, right!"\nNow, here\'s the experiment we did,\nand I would hope this is going to convince you that\n"Yeah, right!" was not the right response.'
p319
aS"\nWe did this experiment with a group of patients\nwho had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients.\nMost of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,\na polyneuritic psychosis that -- they drank way too much,\nand they can't make new memories.\nOK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself,\nand then leave the room,\nwhen you come back, they don't know who you are."
p320
aS'\nWe took our Monet prints to the hospital.\nAnd we asked these patients to rank them\nfrom the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.\nWe then gave them the choice between number three and number four.\nLike everybody else, they said,\n"Gee, thanks Doc! That\'s great! I could use a new print.\nI\'ll take number three."\nWe explained we would have number three mailed to them.\nWe gathered up our materials and we went out of the room,\nand counted to a half hour.\nBack into the room, we say, "Hi, we\'re back."\nThe patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I\'m sorry,\nI\'ve got a memory problem; that\'s why I\'m here.\nIf I\'ve met you before, I don\'t remember."\n"Really, Jim, you don\'t remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?"\n"Sorry, Doc, I just don\'t have a clue."\n"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me\nfrom the one you like the most to the one you like the least."'
p321
aS"\nWhat do they do? Well, let's first check and make sure\nthey're really amnesiac. We ask these\namnesiac patients to tell us which one they own,\nwhich one they chose last time, which one is theirs.\nAnd what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.\nThese are normal controls, where if I did this with you,\nall of you would know which print you chose.\nBut if I do this with amnesiac patients,\nthey don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup."
p322
aS'\nHere\'s what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness.\nRight? This is the change in liking score,\nthe change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.\nNormal controls show\n-- that was the magic I showed you;\nnow I\'m showing it to you in graphical form --\n"The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn\'t own,\nthe one I left behind, is not as good as I thought."\nAmnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.'
p323
aS'\nThese people like better the one they own,\nbut they don\'t know they own it.\n"Yeah, right" is not the right response!\nWhat these people did when they synthesized happiness\nis they really, truly changed\ntheir affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.\nThey\'re not just saying it because they own it,\nbecause they don\'t know they own it.'
p324
aS"\nNow, when psychologists show you bars,\nyou know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.\nAnd yet, all of us have this psychological immune system,\nthis capacity to synthesize happiness,\nbut some of us do this trick better than others.\nAnd some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively\nthan other situations do.\nIt turns out that freedom\n-- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind --\nis the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose\namong all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy.\nBut freedom to choose\n-- to change and make up your mind -- is the enemy of synthetic happiness.\nAnd I'm going to show you why."
p325
aS'\nDilbert already knows, of course.\nYou\'re reading the cartoon as I\'m talking.\n"Dogbert\'s tech support. How may I abuse you?"\n"My printer prints a blank page after every document."\n"Why would you complain about getting free paper?"\n"Free? Aren\'t you just giving me my own paper?"\n"Egad, man! Look at the quality of the free paper\ncompared to your lousy regular paper!\nOnly a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"\n"Ah! Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"\n"What are you doing?"\n"I\'m helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed.'
p326
aS"\nThe psychological immune system works best\nwhen we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.\nThis is the difference between dating and marriage, right?\nI mean, you go out on a date with a guy,\nand he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.\nYou're married to a guy and he picks his nose?\nYeah, he has a heart of gold;\ndon't touch the fruitcake. Right? (Laughter)\nYou find a way to be happy with what's happened.\nNow what I want to show you is that\npeople don't know this about themselves,\nand not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage."
p327
aS'\nHere\'s an experiment we did at Harvard.\nWe created a photography course, a black-and-white photography course,\nand we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.\nSo we gave them cameras; they went around campus;\nthey took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog,\nand all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.\nThey bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet;\nthey figure out which are the two best pictures;\nand we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms.\nAnd they blow two of them up,\nand they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of\nmeaningful things to them, and we say,\n"Which one would you like to give up?"\nThey say, "I have to give one up?"\n"Oh, yes. We need one as evidence of the class project.\nSo you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.\nYou get to keep one, and I get to keep one."'
p328
aS'\nNow, there are two conditions in this experiment.\nIn one case, the students are told, "But you know,\nif you want to change your mind, I\'ll always have the other one here,\nand in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters,\nI\'ll be glad to" -- (Laughter) -- yeah, "headquarters" --\n"I\'ll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact,\nI\'ll come to your dorm room and give\n-- just give me an email. Better yet, I\'ll check with you.\nYou ever want to change your mind, it\'s totally returnable."\nThe other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:\n"Make your choice. And by the way,\nthe mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.\nYour picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.\nYou will never see it again."\nNow, half of the students in each of these conditions\nare asked to make predictions about how much\nthey\'re going to come to like the picture that they keep\nand the picture they leave behind.\nOther students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms\nand they are measured over the next three to six days\non their liking, satisfaction with the pictures.\nAnd look at what we find.'
p329
aS"\nFirst of all, here's what students think is going to happen.\nThey think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose\na little more than the one they left behind,\nbut these are not statistically significant differences.\nIt's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter\nwhether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition."
p330
aS'\nWrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here\'s what\'s really happening.\nBoth right before the swap and five days later,\npeople who are stuck with that picture,\nwho have no choice,\nwho can never change their mind, like it a lot!\nAnd people who are deliberating -- "Should I return it?\nHave I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn\'t the good one?\nMaybe I left the good one?" -- have killed themselves.\nThey don\'t like their picture, and in fact\neven after the opportunity to swap has expired,\nthey still don\'t like their picture. Why?\nBecause the reversible condition is not conducive\nto the synthesis of happiness.'
p331
aS'\nSo here\'s the final piece of this experiment.\nWe bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students\nand we say, "You know, we\'re doing a photography course,\nand we can do it one of two ways.\nWe could do it so that when you take the two pictures,\nyou\'d have four days to change your mind,\nor we\'re doing another course where you take the two pictures\nand you make up your mind right away\nand you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in?"\nDuh! 66 percent of the students, two-thirds,\nprefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.\nHello? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will\nultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture.\nBecause they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.'
p332
aS'\nThe Bard said everything best, of course, and he\'s making my point here\nbut he\'s making it hyperbolically:\n"\'Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so."\nIt\'s nice poetry, but that can\'t exactly be right.\nIs there really nothing good or bad?\nIs it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris\nare just the same thing? That seems like a one-question IQ test.\nThey can\'t be exactly the same.'
p333
aS'\nIn more turgid prose, but closer to the truth,\nwas the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.\nThis is worth contemplating:\n"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life\nseems to arise from overrating the difference\nbetween one permanent situation and another ...\nSome of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others,\nbut none of them can deserve to be pursued\nwith that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules\neither of prudence or of justice, or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds,\neither by shame from the remembrance of our own folly,\nor by remorse for the horror of our own injustice."\nIn other words: yes, some things are better than others.'
p334
aS"\nWe should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.\nBut when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast\nbecause we have overrated the difference between these futures,\nwe are at risk.\nWhen our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully.\nWhen our ambition is unbounded, it leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others,\nto sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded,\nwe're prudent; we're cautious; we're thoughtful.\nWhen our fears are unbounded and overblown,\nwe're reckless, and we're cowardly."
p335
aS'\nThe lesson I want to leave you with from these data\nis that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown,\nbecause we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity\nwe are constantly chasing when we choose experience.'
p336
aS'\nThank you.'
p337
aa(lp338
S'\nWhen I was nine years old\nI went off to summer camp for the first time.\nAnd my mother packed me a suitcase\nfull of books,\nwhich to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.\nBecause in my family,\nreading was the primary group activity.\nAnd this might sound antisocial to you,\nbut for us it was really just a different way of being social.\nYou have the animal warmth of your family\nsitting right next to you,\nbut you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland\ninside your own mind.\nAnd I had this idea\nthat camp was going to be just like this, but better.\n(Laughter)\nI had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin\ncozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.'
p339
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p340
aS'\nCamp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.\nAnd on the very first day\nour counselor gathered us all together\nand she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing\nevery day for the rest of the summer\nto instill camp spirit.\nAnd it went like this:\n"R-O-W-D-I-E,\nthat\'s the way we spell rowdie.\nRowdie, rowdie, let\'s get rowdie."\nYeah.\nSo I couldn\'t figure out for the life of me\nwhy we were supposed to be so rowdy,\nor why we had to spell this word incorrectly.\n(Laughter)\nBut I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.\nI did my best.\nAnd I just waited for the time\nthat I could go off and read my books.'
p341
aS'\nBut the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase,\nthe coolest girl in the bunk came up to me\nand she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" --\nmellow, of course, being the exact opposite\nof R-O-W-D-I-E.\nAnd then the second time I tried it,\nthe counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face\nand she repeated the point about camp spirit\nand said we should all work very hard\nto be outgoing.'
p342
aS"\nAnd so I put my books away,\nback in their suitcase,\nand I put them under my bed,\nand there they stayed for the rest of the summer.\nAnd I felt kind of guilty about this.\nI felt as if the books needed me somehow,\nand they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.\nBut I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again\nuntil I was back home with my family\nat the end of the summer."
p343
aS"\nNow, I tell you this story about summer camp.\nI could have told you 50 others just like it --\nall the times that I got the message\nthat somehow my quiet and introverted style of being\nwas not necessarily the right way to go,\nthat I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.\nAnd I always sensed deep down that this was wrong\nand that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.\nBut for years I denied this intuition,\nand so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things,\ninstead of the writer that I had always longed to be --\npartly because I needed to prove to myself\nthat I could be bold and assertive too.\nAnd I was always going off to crowded bars\nwhen I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.\nAnd I made these self-negating choices\nso reflexively,\nthat I wasn't even aware that I was making them."
p344
aS"\nNow this is what many introverts do,\nand it's our loss for sure,\nbut it is also our colleagues' loss\nand our communities' loss.\nAnd at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.\nBecause when it comes to creativity and to leadership,\nwe need introverts doing what they do best.\nA third to a half of the population are introverts --\na third to a half.\nSo that's one out of every two or three people you know.\nSo even if you're an extrovert yourself,\nI'm talking about your coworkers\nand your spouses and your children\nand the person sitting next to you right now --\nall of them subject to this bias\nthat is pretty deep and real in our society.\nWe all internalize it from a very early age\nwithout even having a language for what we're doing."
p345
aS"\nNow to see the bias clearly\nyou need to understand what introversion is.\nIt's different from being shy.\nShyness is about fear of social judgment.\nIntroversion is more about,\nhow do you respond to stimulation,\nincluding social stimulation.\nSo extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation,\nwhereas introverts feel at their most alive\nand their most switched-on and their most capable\nwhen they're in quieter, more low-key environments.\nNot all the time -- these things aren't absolute --\nbut a lot of the time.\nSo the key then\nto maximizing our talents\nis for us all to put ourselves\nin the zone of stimulation that is right for us."
p346
aS"\nBut now here's where the bias comes in.\nOur most important institutions,\nour schools and our workplaces,\nthey are designed mostly for extroverts\nand for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.\nAnd also we have this belief system right now\nthat I call the new groupthink,\nwhich holds that all creativity and all productivity\ncomes from a very oddly gregarious place."
p347
aS'\nSo if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:\nWhen I was going to school,\nwe sat in rows.\nWe sat in rows of desks like this,\nand we did most of our work pretty autonomously.\nBut nowadays, your typical classroom\nhas pods of desks --\nfour or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.\nAnd kids are working in countless group assignments.\nEven in subjects like math and creative writing,\nwhich you think would depend on solo flights of thought,\nkids are now expected to act as committee members.\nAnd for the kids who prefer\nto go off by themselves or just to work alone,\nthose kids are seen as outliers often\nor, worse, as problem cases.\nAnd the vast majority of teachers reports believing\nthat the ideal student is an extrovert\nas opposed to an introvert,\neven though introverts actually get better grades\nand are more knowledgeable,\naccording to research.\n(Laughter)'
p348
aS"\nOkay, same thing is true in our workplaces.\nNow, most of us work in open plan offices,\nwithout walls,\nwhere we are subject\nto the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.\nAnd when it comes to leadership,\nintroverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions,\neven though introverts tend to be very careful,\nmuch less likely to take outsize risks --\nwhich is something we might all favor nowadays.\nAnd interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School\nhas found that introverted leaders\noften deliver better outcomes than extroverts do,\nbecause when they are managing proactive employees,\nthey're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas,\nwhereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly,\nget so excited about things\nthat they're putting their own stamp on things,\nand other people's ideas might not as easily then\nbubble up to the surface."
p349
aS"\nNow in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.\nI'll give you some examples.\nEleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --\nall these peopled described themselves\nas quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.\nAnd they all took the spotlight,\neven though every bone in their bodies\nwas telling them not to.\nAnd this turns out to have a special power all its own,\nbecause people could feel that these leaders were at the helm,\nnot because they enjoyed directing others\nand not out of the pleasure of being looked at;\nthey were there because they had no choice,\nbecause they were driven to do what they thought was right."
p350
aS"\nNow I think at this point it's important for me to say\nthat I actually love extroverts.\nI always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts,\nincluding my beloved husband.\nAnd we all fall at different points, of course,\nalong the introvert/extrovert spectrum.\nEven Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said\nthat there's no such thing as a pure introvert\nor a pure extrovert.\nHe said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum,\nif he existed at all.\nAnd some people fall smack in the middle\nof the introvert/extrovert spectrum,\nand we call these people ambiverts.\nAnd I often think that they have the best of all worlds.\nBut many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other."
p351
aS"\nAnd what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance.\nWe need more of a yin and yang\nbetween these two types.\nThis is especially important\nwhen it comes to creativity and to productivity,\nbecause when psychologists look\nat the lives of the most creative people,\nwhat they find\nare people who are very good at exchanging ideas\nand advancing ideas,\nbut who also have a serious streak of introversion in them."
p352
aS'\nAnd this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often\nto creativity.\nSo Darwin,\nhe took long walks alone in the woods\nand emphatically turned down dinner party invitations.\nTheodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,\nhe dreamed up many of his amazing creations\nin a lonely bell tower office that he had\nin the back of his house in La Jolla, California.\nAnd he was actually afraid to meet\nthe young children who read his books\nfor fear that they were expecting him\nthis kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure\nand would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.\nSteve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer\nsitting alone in his cubical\nin Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time.\nAnd he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place\nhad he not been too introverted to leave the house\nwhen he was growing up.'
p353
aS"\nNow of course,\nthis does not mean that we should all stop collaborating --\nand case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs\nto start Apple Computer --\nbut it does mean that solitude matters\nand that for some people\nit is the air that they breathe.\nAnd in fact, we have known for centuries\nabout the transcendent power of solitude.\nIt's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.\nIf you look at most of the world's major religions,\nyou will find seekers --\nMoses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --\nseekers who are going off by themselves\nalone to the wilderness\nwhere they then have profound epiphanies and revelations\nthat they then bring back to the rest of the community.\nSo no wilderness, no revelations."
p354
aS"\nThis is no surprise though\nif you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.\nIt turns out that we can't even be in a group of people\nwithout instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.\nEven about seemingly personal and visceral things\nlike who you're attracted to,\nyou will start aping the beliefs of the people around you\nwithout even realizing that that's what you're doing."
p355
aS"\nAnd groups famously follow the opinions\nof the most dominant or charismatic person in the room,\neven though there's zero correlation\nbetween being the best talker and having the best ideas --\nI mean zero.\nSo ...\n(Laughter)\nYou might be following the person with the best ideas,\nbut you might not.\nAnd do you really want to leave it up to chance?\nMuch better for everybody to go off by themselves,\ngenerate their own ideas\nfreed from the distortions of group dynamics,\nand then come together as a team\nto talk them through in a well-managed environment\nand take it from there."
p356
aS'\nNow if all this is true,\nthen why are we getting it so wrong?\nWhy are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces?\nAnd why are we making these introverts feel so guilty\nabout wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?\nOne answer lies deep in our cultural history.\nWestern societies,\nand in particular the U.S.,\nhave always favored the man of action\nover the man of contemplation\nand "man" of contemplation.\nBut in America\'s early days,\nwe lived in what historians call a culture of character,\nwhere we still, at that point, valued people\nfor their inner selves and their moral rectitude.\nAnd if you look at the self-help books from this era,\nthey all had titles with things like\n"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."\nAnd they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln\nwho was praised for being modest and unassuming.\nRalph Waldo Emerson called him\n"A man who does not offend by superiority."'
p357
aS'\nBut then we hit the 20th century\nand we entered a new culture\nthat historians call the culture of personality.\nWhat happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy\nto a world of big business.\nAnd so suddenly people are moving\nfrom small towns to the cities.\nAnd instead of working alongside people they\'ve known all their lives,\nnow they are having to prove themselves\nin a crowd of strangers.\nSo, quite understandably,\nqualities like magnetism and charisma\nsuddenly come to seem really important.\nAnd sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs\nand they start to have names\nlike "How to Win Friends and Influence People."\nAnd they feature as their role models\nreally great salesmen.\nSo that\'s the world we\'re living in today.\nThat\'s our cultural inheritance.'
p358
aS"\nNow none of this is to say\nthat social skills are unimportant,\nand I'm also not calling\nfor the abolishing of teamwork at all.\nThe same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops\nalso teach us love and trust.\nAnd the problems that we are facing today\nin fields like science and in economics\nare so vast and so complex\nthat we are going to need armies of people coming together\nto solve them working together.\nBut I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves,\nthe more likely that they are\nto come up with their own unique solutions to these problems."
p359
aS'\nSo now I\'d like to share with you\nwhat\'s in my suitcase today.\nGuess what?\nBooks.\nI have a suitcase full of books.\nHere\'s Margaret Atwood, "Cat\'s Eye."\nHere\'s a novel by Milan Kundera.\nAnd here\'s "The Guide for the Perplexed"\nby Maimonides.\nBut these are not exactly my books.\nI brought these books with me\nbecause they were written by my grandfather\'s favorite authors.'
p360
aS"\nMy grandfather was a rabbi\nand he was a widower\nwho lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn\nthat was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up,\npartly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence\nand partly because it was filled with books.\nI mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment\nhad yielded its original function\nto now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.\nJust like the rest of my family,\nmy grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read."
p361
aS"\nBut he also loved his congregation,\nand you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave\nevery week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.\nHe would takes the fruits of each week's reading\nand he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.\nAnd people would come from all over\nto hear him speak."
p362
aS"\nBut here's the thing about my grandfather.\nUnderneath this ceremonial role,\nhe was really modest and really introverted --\nso much so that when he delivered these sermons,\nhe had trouble making eye contact\nwith the very same congregation\nthat he had been speaking to for 62 years.\nAnd even away from the podium,\nwhen you called him to say hello,\nhe would often end the conversation prematurely\nfor fear that he was taking up too much of your time.\nBut when he died at the age of 94,\nthe police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood\nto accommodate the crowd of people\nwho came out to mourn him.\nAnd so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example\nin my own way."
p363
aS"\nSo I just published a book about introversion,\nand it took me about seven years to write.\nAnd for me, that seven years was like total bliss,\nbecause I was reading, I was writing,\nI was thinking, I was researching.\nIt was my version\nof my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.\nBut now all of a sudden my job is very different,\nand my job is to be out here talking about it,\ntalking about introversion.\n(Laughter)\nAnd that's a lot harder for me,\nbecause as honored as I am\nto be here with all of you right now,\nthis is not my natural milieu."
p364
aS'\nSo I prepared for moments like these\nas best I could.\nI spent the last year practicing public speaking\nevery chance I could get.\nAnd I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."\n(Laughter)\nAnd that actually helped a lot.\nBut I\'ll tell you, what helps even more\nis my sense, my belief, my hope\nthat when it comes to our attitudes\nto introversion and to quiet and to solitude,\nwe truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.\nI mean, we are.\nAnd so I am going to leave you now\nwith three calls for action\nfor those who share this vision.'
p365
aS"\nNumber one:\nStop the madness for constant group work.\nJust stop it.\n(Laughter)\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nAnd I want to be clear about what I'm saying,\nbecause I deeply believe our offices\nshould be encouraging\ncasual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions --\nyou know, the kind where people come together\nand serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.\nThat is great.\nIt's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.\nBut we need much more privacy and much more freedom\nand much more autonomy at work.\nSchool, same thing.\nWe need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure,\nbut we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.\nThis is especially important for extroverted children too.\nThey need to work on their own\nbecause that is where deep thought comes from in part."
p366
aS"\nOkay, number two: Go to the wilderness.\nBe like Buddha, have your own revelations.\nI'm not saying\nthat we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods\nand never talk to each other again,\nbut I am saying that we could all stand to unplug\nand get inside our own heads\na little more often."
p367
aS"\nNumber three:\nTake a good look at what's inside your own suitcase\nand why you put it there.\nSo extroverts,\nmaybe your suitcases are also full of books.\nOr maybe they're full of champagne glasses\nor skydiving equipment.\nWhatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get\nand grace us with your energy and your joy.\nBut introverts, you being you,\nyou probably have the impulse to guard very carefully\nwhat's inside your own suitcase.\nAnd that's okay.\nBut occasionally, just occasionally,\nI hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see,\nbecause the world needs you and it needs the things you carry."
p368

S"\nOkay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room,\nbut it's just come to my attention\nthat the person to your right is a liar.\n(Laughter)\nAlso, the person to your left is a liar.\nAlso the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.\nWe're all liars.\nWhat I'm going to do today\nis I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars,\nhow you can become a liespotter\nand why you might want to go the extra mile\nand go from liespotting to truth seeking,\nand ultimately to trust building."
p375
aS'\nNow speaking of trust,\never since I wrote this book, "Liespotting,"\nno one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.\nThey say, "It\'s okay, we\'ll email you."\n(Laughter)\nI can\'t even get a coffee date at Starbucks.\nMy husband\'s like, "Honey, deception?\nMaybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"'
p376
aS'\nSo before I get started, what I\'m going to do\nis I\'m going to clarify my goal for you,\nwhich is not to teach a game of Gotcha.\nLiespotters aren\'t those nitpicky kids,\nthose kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!\nYour eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril.\nI watch that TV show \'Lie To Me.\' I know you\'re lying."\nNo, liespotters are armed\nwith scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.\nThey use it to get to the truth,\nand they do what mature leaders do everyday;\nthey have difficult conversations with difficult people,\nsometimes during very difficult times.\nAnd they start up that path\nby accepting a core proposition,\nand that proposition is the following:\nLying is a cooperative act.\nThink about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.\nIts power emerges\nwhen someone else agrees to believe the lie.'
p377
aS'\nSo I know it may sound like tough love,\nbut look, if at some point you got lied to,\nit\'s because you agreed to get lied to.\nTruth number one about lying: Lying\'s a cooperative act.\nNow not all lies are harmful.\nSometimes we\'re willing participants in deception\nfor the sake of social dignity,\nmaybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.\nWe say, "Nice song."\n"Honey, you don\'t look fat in that, no."\nOr we say, favorite of the digiratti,\n"You know, I just fished that email out of my spam folder.\nSo sorry."'
p378
aS"\nBut there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.\nAnd that can have dramatic costs for us.\nLast year saw 997 billion dollars\nin corporate fraud alone in the United States.\nThat's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.\nThat's seven percent of revenues.\nDeception can cost billions.\nThink Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.\nOr in the case of double agents and traitors,\nlike Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,\nlies can betray our country,\nthey can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy,\nthey can cause the deaths of those that defend us."
p379
aS'\nDeception is actually serious business.\nThis con man, Henry Oberlander,\nhe was such an effective con man\nBritish authorities say\nhe could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.\nAnd you can\'t find this guy on Google; you can\'t find him anywhere.\nHe was interviewed once, and he said the following.\nHe said, "Look, I\'ve got one rule."\nAnd this was Henry\'s rule, he said,\n"Look, everyone is willing to give you something.\nThey\'re ready to give you something for whatever it is they\'re hungry for."\nAnd that\'s the crux of it.\nIf you don\'t want to be deceived, you have to know,\nwhat is it that you\'re hungry for?\nAnd we all kind of hate to admit it.\nWe wish we were better husbands, better wives,\nsmarter, more powerful,\ntaller, richer --\nthe list goes on.\nLying is an attempt to bridge that gap,\nto connect our wishes and our fantasies\nabout who we wish we were, how we wish we could be,\nwith what we\'re really like.\nAnd boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.'
p380
aS"\nOn a given day, studies show that you may be lied to\nanywhere from 10 to 200 times.\nNow granted, many of those are white lies.\nBut in another study,\nit showed that strangers lied three times\nwithin the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.\n(Laughter)\nNow when we first hear this data, we recoil.\nWe can't believe how prevalent lying is.\nWe're essentially against lying.\nBut if you look more closely,\nthe plot actually thickens.\nWe lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.\nExtroverts lie more than introverts.\nMen lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people.\nWomen lie more to protect other people.\nIf you're an average married couple,\nyou're going to lie to your spouse\nin one out of every 10 interactions.\nNow you may think that's bad.\nIf you're unmarried, that number drops to three."
p381
aS"\nLying's complex.\nIt's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.\nWe're deeply ambivalent about the truth.\nWe parse it out on an as-needed basis,\nsometimes for very good reasons,\nother times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.\nThat's truth number two about lying.\nWe're against lying,\nbut we're covertly for it\nin ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries and centuries and centuries.\nIt's as old as breathing.\nIt's part of our culture, it's part of our history.\nThink Dante, Shakespeare,\nthe Bible, News of the World."
p382
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p383
aS"\nLying has evolutionary value to us as a species.\nResearchers have long known\nthat the more intelligent the species,\nthe larger the neocortex,\nthe more likely it is to be deceptive.\nNow you might remember Koko.\nDoes anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?\nKoko was taught to communicate via sign language.\nHere's Koko with her kitten.\nIt's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.\nKoko once blamed her pet kitten\nfor ripping a sink out of the wall.\n(Laughter)\nWe're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.\nIt's starts really, really early.\nHow early?\nWell babies will fake a cry,\npause, wait to see who's coming\nand then go right back to crying.\nOne-year-olds learn concealment.\n(Laughter)\nTwo-year-olds bluff.\nFive-year-olds lie outright.\nThey manipulate via flattery.\nNine-year-olds, masters of the cover up.\nBy the time you enter college,\nyou're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.\nBy the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners,\nwe enter a world that is just cluttered\nwith spam, fake digital friends,\npartisan media,\ningenious identity thieves,\nworld-class Ponzi schemers,\na deception epidemic --\nin short, what one author calls\na post-truth society.\nIt's been very confusing\nfor a long time now."
p384
aS"\nWhat do you do?\nWell there are steps we can take\nto navigate our way through the morass.\nTrained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.\nThe rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.\nWhy is it so easy to learn?\nThere are good liars and there are bad liars. There are no real original liars.\nWe all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.\nSo what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.\nAnd then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves.\nWe're going to start with speech."
p385
aS"\n(Video) Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.\nI'm going to say this again.\nI did not have sexual relations\nwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\nI never told anybody to lie,\nnot a single time, never.\nAnd these allegations are false.\nAnd I need to go back to work for the American people.\nThank you."
p386
aS'\nPamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs?\nWell first we heard what\'s known as a non-contracted denial.\nStudies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial\nwill resort to formal rather than informal language.\nWe also heard distancing language: "that woman."\nWe know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves\nfrom their subject\nusing language as their tool.\nNow if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ... "\nor Richard Nixon\'s favorite, "In all candor ... "\nhe would have been a dead giveaway\nfor any liespotter than knows\nthat qualifying language, as it\'s called, qualifying language like that,\nfurther discredits the subject.\nNow if he had repeated the question in its entirety,\nor if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail --\nand we\'re all really glad he didn\'t do that --\nhe would have further discredited himself.\nFreud had it right.\nFreud said, look, there\'s much more to it than speech:\n"No mortal can keep a secret.\nIf his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."\nAnd we all do it no matter how powerful you are.\nWe all chatter with our fingertips.\nI\'m going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama\nwho\'s chattering with his fingertips.'
p387
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p388
aS"\nNow this brings us to our next pattern,\nwhich is body language.\nWith body language, here's what you've got to do.\nYou've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.\nLet the science temper your knowledge a little bit.\nBecause we think liars fidget all the time.\nWell guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.\nWe think liars won't look you in the eyes.\nWell guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much\njust to compensate for that myth.\nWe think warmth and smiles\nconvey honesty, sincerity.\nBut a trained liespotter\ncan spot a fake smile a mile away.\nCan you all spot the fake smile here?\nYou can consciously contract\nthe muscles in your cheeks.\nBut the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.\nThey cannot be consciously contracted,\nespecially if you overdid the Botox.\nDon't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest."
p389
aS"\nNow we're going to look at the hot spots.\nCan you tell what's happening in a conversation?\nCan you start to find the hot spots\nto see the discrepancies\nbetween someone's words and someone's actions?\nNow I know it seems really obvious,\nbut when you're having a conversation\nwith someone you suspect of deception,\nattitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators."
p390
aS'\nAn honest person is going to be cooperative.\nThey\'re going to show they\'re on your side.\nThey\'re going to be enthusiastic.\nThey\'re going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.\nThey\'re going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects,\nprovide details.\nThey\'re going to say, "Hey,\nmaybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."\nThey\'re going to be infuriated if they sense they\'re wrongly accused\nthroughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes;\nthey\'ll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.\nAnd if you ask someone honest\nwhat should happen to whomever did forge those checks,\nan honest person is much more likely\nto recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.'
p391
aS'\nNow let\'s say you\'re having that exact same conversation\nwith someone deceptive.\nThat person may be withdrawn,\nlook down, lower their voice,\npause, be kind of herky-jerky.\nAsk a deceptive person to tell their story,\nthey\'re going to pepper it with way too much detail\nin all kinds of irrelevant places.\nAnd then they\'re going to tell their story in strict chronological order.\nAnd what a trained interrogator does\nis they come in and in very subtle ways\nover the course of several hours,\nthey will ask that person to tell that story backwards,\nand then they\'ll watch them squirm,\nand track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.\nWhy do they do that? Well we all do the same thing.\nWe rehearse our words,\nbut we rarely rehearse our gestures.\nWe say "yes," we shake our heads "no."\nWe tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.\nWe commit terrible crimes,\nand we smile at the delight in getting away with it.\nNow that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."'
p392
aS'\nAnd we\'re going to see that in several videos moving forward,\nbut we\'re going to start -- for those of you who don\'t know him,\nthis is presidential candidate John Edwards\nwho shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.\nWe\'re going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.\nSee now if you can spot him\nsaying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"\nslightly shrugging his shoulders.'
p393
aS"\n(Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.\nI know that it's not possible that this child could be mine,\nbecause of the timing of events.\nSo I know it's not possible.\nHappy to take a paternity test,\nand would love to see it happen.\nInterviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody --\nJE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test.\nBut I'm happy to participate in one."
p394
aS'\nPM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot\nonce you know to look for them.\nThere\'re going to be times\nwhen someone makes one expression\nwhile masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.\nMurderers are known to leak sadness.\nYour new joint venture partner might shake your hand,\ncelebrate, go out to dinner with you\nand then leak an expression of anger.\nAnd we\'re not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here,\nbut there\'s one I can teach you that\'s very dangerous, and it\'s easy to learn,\nand that\'s the expression of contempt.\nNow with anger, you\'ve got two people on an even playing field.\nIt\'s still somewhat of a healthy relationship.\nBut when anger turns to contempt,\nyou\'ve been dismissed.\nIt\'s associated with moral superiority.\nAnd for that reason, it\'s very, very hard to recover from.\nHere\'s what it looks like.\nIt\'s marked by one lip corner\npulled up and in.\nIt\'s the only asymmetrical expression.\nAnd in the presence of contempt,\nwhether or not deception follows --\nand it doesn\'t always follow --\nlook the other way, go the other direction,\nreconsider the deal,\nsay, "No thank you. I\'m not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."'
p395
aS'\nScience has surfaced\nmany, many more indicators.\nWe know, for example,\nwe know liars will shift their blink rate,\npoint their feet towards an exit.\nThey will take barrier objects\nand put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.\nThey\'ll alter their vocal tone,\noften making their vocal tone much lower.\nNow here\'s the deal.\nThese behaviors are just behaviors.\nThey\'re not proof of deception.\nThey\'re red flags.\nWe\'re human beings.\nWe make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.\nThey don\'t mean anything in and of themselves.\nBut when you see clusters of them, that\'s your signal.\nLook, listen, probe, ask some hard questions,\nget out of that very comfortable mode of knowing,\nwalk into curiosity mode, ask more questions,\nhave a little dignity, treat the person you\'re talking to with rapport.\nDon\'t try to be like those folks on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows\nthat pummel their subjects into submission.\nDon\'t be too aggressive, it doesn\'t work.'
p396
aS"\nNow we've talked a little bit\nabout how to talk to someone who's lying\nand how to spot a lie.\nAnd as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.\nBut I'm going to show you two videos,\ntwo mothers -- one is lying, one is telling the truth.\nAnd these were surfaced\nby researcher David Matsumoto in California.\nAnd I think they're an excellent example\nof what the truth looks like."
p397
aS"\nThis mother, Diane Downs,\nshot her kids at close range,\ndrove them to the hospital\nwhile they bled all over the car,\nclaimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.\nAnd you'll see when you see the video,\nshe can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.\nWhat you want to look for here\nis an incredible discrepancy\nbetween horrific events that she describes\nand her very, very cool demeanor.\nAnd if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video."
p398
aS"\n(Video) Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes,\nI can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving,\nand the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.\nAnd that -- maybe it'll fade too with time --\nbut I don't think so.\nThat bothers me the most."
p399
aS"\nPM: Now I'm going to show you a video\nof an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion,\nconfronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.\nHere you're going to see no false emotion,\njust the authentic expression of a mother's agony."
p400
aS"\n(Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement on the third anniversary\nof the night you took my baby,\nand you hurt her,\nand you crushed her,\nyou terrified her until her heart stopped.\nAnd she fought, and I know she fought you.\nBut I know she looked at you\nwith those amazing brown eyes,\nand you still wanted to kill her.\nAnd I don't understand it,\nand I never will."
p401
aS"\nPM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions."
p402
aS"\nNow the technology around what the truth looks like\nis progressing on, the science of it.\nWe know for example\nthat we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans,\nMRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out\nwhen we're trying to be deceptive.\nAnd these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us\nas panaceas for deceit,\nand they will prove incredibly useful some day.\nBut you've got to ask yourself in the meantime:\nWho do you want on your side of the meeting,\nsomeone who's trained in getting to the truth\nor some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram\nthrough the door?"
p403
aS'\nLiespotters rely on human tools.\nThey know, as someone once said,\n"Character\'s who you are in the dark."\nAnd what\'s kind of interesting\nis that today we have so little darkness.\nOur world is lit up 24 hours a day.\nIt\'s transparent\nwith blogs and social networks\nbroadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people\nthat have made a choice to live their lives in public.\nIt\'s a much more noisy world.\nSo one challenge we have\nis to remember,\noversharing, that\'s not honesty.\nOur manic tweeting and texting\ncan blind us to the fact\nthat the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity --\nthat\'s still what matters, that\'s always what\'s going to matter.\nSo in this much noisier world,\nit might make sense for us\nto be just a little bit more explicit\nabout our moral code.'
p404
aS'\nWhen you combine the science of recognizing deception\nwith the art of looking, listening,\nyou exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.\nYou start up that path\nof being just a little bit more explicit,\nbecause you signal to everyone around you,\nyou say, "Hey, my world, our world,\nit\'s going to be an honest one.\nMy world is going to be one where truth is strengthened\nand falsehood is recognized and marginalized."\nAnd when you do that,\nthe ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.'
p405
aS"\nAnd that's the truth. Thank you."

p407
aa(lp408
S'\nI am a writer.\nWriting books is my profession but it\'s more than that, of course.\nIt is also my great lifelong love and fascination.\nAnd I don\'t expect that that\'s ever going to change.\nBut, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently\nin my life and in my career,\nwhich has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.\nAnd the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,\nthis memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"\nwhich, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,\nwent out in the world for some reason, and became this big,\nmega-sensation, international bestseller thing.\nThe result of which is that everywhere I go now,\npeople treat me like I\'m doomed.\nSeriously -- doomed, doomed!\nLike, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,\n"Aren\'t you afraid you\'re never going to be able to top that?\nAren\'t you afraid you\'re going to keep writing for your whole life\nand you\'re never again going to create a book\nthat anybody in the world cares about at all,\never again?"'
p409
aS'\nSo that\'s reassuring, you know.\nBut it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember\nthat over 20 years ago, when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager --\nthat I wanted to be a writer,\nI was met with this same kind of, sort of fear-based reaction.\nAnd people would say, "Aren\'t you afraid you\'re never going to have any success?\nAren\'t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?\nAren\'t you afraid that you\'re going to work your whole life at this craft\nand nothing\'s ever going to come of it\nand you\'re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams\nwith your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"\n(Laughter)\nLike that, you know.'
p410
aS'\nThe answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."\nYes, I\'m afraid of all those things.\nAnd I always have been.\nAnd I\'m afraid of many, many more things besides\nthat people can\'t even guess at,\nlike seaweed and other things that are scary.\nBut, when it comes to writing,\nthe thing that I\'ve been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?\nYou know, is it rational?\nIs it logical that anybody should be expected\nto be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.\nAnd what is it specifically about creative ventures\nthat seems to make us really nervous about each other\'s mental health\nin a way that other careers kind of don\'t do, you know?\nLike my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer\nand I don\'t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering\nanybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?\nIt didn\'t -- that chemical-engineering block, John, how\'s it going?\nIt just didn\'t come up like that, you know?\nBut to be fair, chemical engineers as a group\nhaven\'t really earned a reputation over the centuries\nfor being alcoholic manic-depressives.\n(Laughter)'
p411
aS'\nWe writers, we kind of do have that reputation,\nand not just writers, but creative people across all genres,\nit seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.\nAnd all you have to do is look at the very grim death count\nin the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds\nwho died young and often at their own hands, you know?\nAnd even the ones who didn\'t literally commit suicide\nseem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.\nNorman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said\n"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."\nAn extraordinary statement to make about your life\'s work.\nBut we don\'t even blink when we hear somebody say this\nbecause we\'ve heard that kind of stuff for so long\nand somehow we\'ve completely internalized and accepted collectively\nthis notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked\nand that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.'
p412
aS"\nAnd the question that I want to ask everybody here today\nis are you guys all cool with that idea?\nAre you comfortable with that?\nBecause you look at it even from an inch away and, you know ...\nI'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.\nI think it's odious.\nAnd I also think it's dangerous,\nand I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.\nI think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live."
p413
aS"\nAnd I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --\nit would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path\nof assumption, particularly given the circumstance\nthat I'm in right now in my career.\nWhich is -- you know, like check it out,\nI'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.\nI still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.\nAnd it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward\nis going to be judged by the world as the work that came after\nthe freakish success of my last book, right?\nI should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --\nit's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.\nSo Jesus, what a thought!\nThat's the kind of thought that could lead a person\nto start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,\nand I don't want to go there.\n(Laughter)\nI would prefer to keep doing this work that I love."
p414
aS"\nAnd so, the question becomes, how?\nAnd so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,\nthat the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,\nis that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?\nI have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance\nbetween me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety\nabout what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.\nAnd, as I've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that\nI've been sort of looking across time,\nand I've been trying to find other societies\nto see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have\nabout how to help creative people, sort of manage\nthe inherent emotional risks of creativity."
p415
aS'\nAnd that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.\nSo stay with me, because it does circle around and back.\nBut, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --\npeople did not happen to believe that creativity\ncame from human beings back then, O.K.?\nPeople believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit\nthat came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,\nfor distant and unknowable reasons.\nThe Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."\nSocrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon\nwho spoke wisdom to him from afar.\nThe Romans had the same idea,\nbut they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.\nWhich is great, because the Romans did not actually think\nthat a genius was a particularly clever individual.\nThey believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,\nwho was believed to literally live in the walls\nof an artist\'s studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf,\nand who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work\nand would shape the outcome of that work.'
p416
aS"\nSo brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --\nthat psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.\nAnd everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?\nSo the ancient artist was protected from certain things,\nlike, for example, too much narcissism, right?\nIf your work was brilliant you couldn't take all the credit for it,\neverybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.\nIf your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?\nEveryone knew your genius was kind of lame.\nAnd this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time."
p417
aS"\nAnd then the Renaissance came and everything changed,\nand we had this big idea, and the big idea was\nlet's put the individual human being at the center of the universe\nabove all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room\nfor mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.\nAnd it's the beginning of rational humanism,\nand people started to believe that creativity\ncame completely from the self of the individual.\nAnd for the first time in history,\nyou start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius\nrather than having a genius."
p418
aS"\nAnd I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.\nYou know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person\nto believe that he or she is like, the vessel,\nyou know, like the font and the essence and the source\nof all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery\nis just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.\nIt's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.\nIt just completely warps and distorts egos,\nand it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.\nAnd I think the pressure of that\nhas been killing off our artists for the last 500 years."
p419
aS"\nAnd, if this is true,\nand I think it is true,\nthe question becomes, what now?\nCan we do this differently?\nMaybe go back to some more ancient understanding\nabout the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.\nMaybe not.\nMaybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought\nin one 18 minute speech.\nAnd there's probably people in this audience\nwho would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions\nabout the notion of, basically fairies\nwho follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.\nI'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this."
p420
aS'\nBut the question that I kind of want to pose is --\nyou know, why not?\nWhy not think about it this way?\nBecause it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard\nin terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness\nof the creative process.\nA process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something --\nwhich is to say basically everyone here ---\nknows does not always behave rationally.\nAnd, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.'
p421
aS'\nI had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,\nwho\'s now in her 90s, but she\'s been a poet her entire life\nand she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,\nshe would be out working in the fields,\nand she said she would feel and hear a poem\ncoming at her from over the landscape.\nAnd she said it was like a thunderous train of air.\nAnd it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.\nAnd she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.\nShe knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,\nand that was to, in her words, "run like hell."\nAnd she would run like hell to the house\nand she would be getting chased by this poem,\nand the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil\nfast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it\nand grab it on the page.\nAnd other times she wouldn\'t be fast enough,\nso she\'d be running and running and running, and she wouldn\'t get to the house\nand the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it\nand she said it would continue on across the landscape,\nlooking, as she put it "for another poet."\nAnd then there were these times --\nthis is the piece I never forgot --\nshe said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?\nSo, she\'s running to the house and she\'s looking for the paper\nand the poem passes through her,\nand she grabs a pencil just as it\'s going through her,\nand then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand\nand she would catch it.\nShe would catch the poem by its tail,\nand she would pull it backwards into her body\nas she was transcribing on the page.\nAnd in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact\nbut backwards, from the last word to the first.\n(Laughter)'
p422
aS"\nSo when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny,\nthat's exactly what my creative process is like.\n(Laughter)"
p423
aS"\nThat's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!\nI'm a mule, and the way that I have to work\nis that I have to get up at the same time every day,\nand sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.\nBut even I, in my mulishness,\neven I have brushed up against that thing, at times.\nAnd I would imagine that a lot of you have too.\nYou know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source\nthat I honestly cannot identify.\nAnd what is that thing?\nAnd how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,\nbut, in fact, might actually keep us sane?"
p424
aS'\nAnd for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that\nis the musician Tom Waits,\nwho I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.\nAnd we were talking about this,\nand you know, Tom, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment\nof the tormented contemporary modern artist,\ntrying to control and manage and dominate\nthese sort of uncontrollable creative impulses\nthat were totally internalized.'
p425
aS"\nBut then he got older, he got calmer,\nand one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me,\nand this is when it all changed for him.\nAnd he's speeding along, and all of a sudden\nhe hears this little fragment of melody,\nthat comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,\nand he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous,\nand he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.\nHe doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a pencil,\nhe doesn't have a tape recorder."
p426
aS'\nSo he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him\nlike, "I\'m going to lose this thing,\nand then I\'m going to be haunted by this song forever.\nI\'m not good enough, and I can\'t do it."\nAnd instead of panicking, he just stopped.\nHe just stopped that whole mental process\nand he did something completely novel.\nHe just looked up at the sky, and he said,\n"Excuse me, can you not see that I\'m driving?"\n(Laughter)\n"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?\nIf you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment\nwhen I can take care of you.\nOtherwise, go bother somebody else today.\nGo bother Leonard Cohen."'
p427
aS"\nAnd his whole work process changed after that.\nNot the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.\nBut the process, and the heavy anxiety around it\nwas released when he took the genie, the genius out of him\nwhere it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from,\nand realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.\nIt could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration\nkind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing\nthat was not quite Tom."
p428
aS'\nSo when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit\nthe way that I worked too, and it already saved me once.\nThis idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"\nand I fell into one of those, sort of pits of despair\nthat we all fall into when we\'re working on something and it\'s not coming\nand you start to think this is going to be a disaster,\nthis is going to be the worst book ever written.\nNot just bad, but the worst book ever written.\nAnd I started to think I should just dump this project.\nBut then I remembered Tom talking to the open air\nand I tried it.\nSo I just lifted my face up from the manuscript\nand I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.\nAnd I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,\nyou and I both know that if this book isn\'t brilliant\nthat is not entirely my fault, right?\nBecause you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,\nI don\'t have any more than this.\nSo if you want it to be better, then you\'ve got to show up and do your part of the deal.\nO.K. But if you don\'t do that, you know what, the hell with it.\nI\'m going to keep writing anyway because that\'s my job.\nAnd I would please like the record to reflect today\nthat I showed up for my part of the job."\n(Laughter)'
p429
aS"\nBecause --\n(Applause)\nin the end it's like this, O.K. --\ncenturies ago in the deserts of North Africa,\npeople used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music\nthat would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.\nAnd they were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals\nand they were terrific, right?\nBut every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,\nand one of these performers would actually become transcendent.\nAnd I know you know what I'm talking about,\nbecause I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.\nIt was like time would stop,\nand the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal\nand he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before,\nbut everything would align.\nAnd all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.\nHe would be lit from within, and lit from below\nand all lit up on fire with divinity."
p430
aS'\nAnd when this happened, back then,\npeople knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.\nThey would put their hands together and they would start to chant,\n"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."\nThat\'s God, you know.\nCurious historical footnote --\nwhen the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them\nand the pronunciation changed over the centuries\nfrom "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Ol, ol, ol,"\nwhich you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.\nIn Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,\n"Allah, ol, ol, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"\nincomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.\nWhich is great, because we need that.'
p431
aS"\nBut, the tricky bit comes the next morning,\nfor the dancer himself, when he wakes up\nand discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.\nHe's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,\nand maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.\nAnd maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,\nand what is he then to do with the rest of his life?\nThis is hard.\nThis is one of the most painful reconciliations to make\nin a creative life.\nBut maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish\nif you never happened to believe, in the first place,\nthat the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.\nBut maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you\nfrom some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life\nto be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.\nAnd, you know, if we think about it this way it starts to change everything."
p432
aS"\nThis is how I've started to think,\nand this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months\nas I've been working on the book that will soon be published,\nas the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up\nto my freakish success."
p433
aS'\nAnd what I have to, sort of keep telling myself\nwhen I get really psyched out about that,\nis, don\'t be afraid.\nDon\'t be daunted.\nJust do your job.\nContinue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.\nIf your job is to dance, do your dance.\nIf the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case\ndecides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment\nthrough your efforts, then "Ol!"\nAnd if not, do your dance anyhow.\nAnd "Ol!" to you, nonetheless.\nI believe this and I feel that we must teach it.\n"Ol!" to you, nonetheless,\njust for having the sheer human love and stubbornness\nto keep showing up.'
p434
aS'\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nThank you.\n(Applause)'

p436
aa(lp437
S'\nAbout 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development\nto Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent\nabout 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa,\nso I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.\nAnd I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute,\nan undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get\nthat opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students\ncoming to us actually have the highest grade you can get\nin Swedish college systems -- so, I thought, maybe they know everything\nI\'m going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came.\nAnd one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one:\n"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"'
p438
aS"\nAnd I put them together, so that in each pair of country,\none has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that\nit's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data.\nI won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey,\nwhich is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.\nAnd these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got\nthe confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy,\nof course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that\nthere was a place for a professor of international health --\n(Laughter) and for my course."
p439
aS'\nBut one late night, when I was compiling the report\nI really realized my discovery. I have shown\nthat Swedish top students know statistically significantly less\nabout the world than the chimpanzees.\n(Laughter)\nBecause the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them\ntwo bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases.'
p440
aS'\nBut the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance;\nit was preconceived ideas.'
p441
aS"\nI did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute\n(Laughter)\n-- that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine,\nand they are on par with the chimpanzee there.\n(Laughter)\nThis is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate,\nbecause the data of what's happening in the world\nand the child health of every country is very well aware."
p442
aS'\nWe did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country.\nThis country over here is China. This is India.\nThe size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here I put fertility rate.\nBecause my students, what they said\nwhen they looked upon the world, and I asked them,\n"What do you really think about the world?"\nWell, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.\n(Laughter)\nAnd they said, "The world is still \'we\' and \'them.\'\nAnd we is Western world and them is Third World."\n"And what do you mean with Western world?" I said.\n"Well, that\'s long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family."'
p443
aS'\nSo this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman:\none, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.\nWe have very good data since 1962 -- 1960 about -- on the size of families in all countries.\nThe error margin is narrow. Here I put life expectancy at birth,\nfrom 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.\nAnd 1962, there was really a group of countries here\nthat was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives.\nAnd these were the developing countries:\nthey had large families and they had relatively short lives.\nNow what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change.\nAre the students right? Is it still two types of countries?\nOr have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?\nOr have they got longer lives and live up there?'
p444
aS"\nLet's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics\nthat have been available. Here we go. Can you see there?\nIt's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.\nAll the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.\nYour yellow ones here are the Arabic countries,\nand they get larger families, but they -- no, longer life, but not larger families.\nThe Africans are the green down here. They still remain here.\nThis is India. Indonesia's moving on pretty fast.\n(Laughter)\nAnd in the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries there.\nBut now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s:\nthe imams start to promote family planning.\nThey move up into that corner. And in '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic\nthat takes down the life expectancy of the African countries\nand all the rest of them move up into the corner,\nwhere we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.\n(Applause)"
p445
aS"\nLet me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam.\n1964: America had small families and long life;\nVietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens:\nthe data during the war indicate that even with all the death,\nthere was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year,\nthe family planning started in Vietnam and they went for smaller families.\nAnd the United States up there is getting for longer life,\nkeeping family size. And in the '80s now,\nthey give up communist planning and they go for market economy,\nand it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have\nin Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size\nhere in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war.\nI think we all -- if we don't look in the data --\nwe underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was\nin social change before we saw the economical change."
p446
aS"\nLet's move over to another way here in which we could display\nthe distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people.\nOne dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.\nThere's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth.\nThere's a little hump here. But there are people all the way.\nAnd if we look where the income ends up -- the income --\nthis is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent,\nthey take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent,\nthey take about two percent. And this shows that the concept\nof developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like\nthese people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle,\nwe have most the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income."
p447
aS"\nWe heard it in other forms. And who are these?\nWhere are the different countries? I can show you Africa.\nThis is Africa. 10 percent the world population, most in poverty.\nThis is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N.\nAnd they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.\nAnd this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth,\nfrom the poorest to the richest, in Latin America.\nAnd on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia,\nand we put South Asia. And how did it look like if we go back in time,\nto about 1970? Then there was more of a hump.\nAnd we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.\nThe problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward,\nyou will see that while population increase, there are\nhundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others\ngetting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today.\nAnd the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen,\nand we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle."
p448
aS"\nOf course it's a logarithmic scale here,\nbut our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it\nas a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this, and I take\nGDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these\nindividual data into regional data of gross domestic product,\nand I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population.\nAnd you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,\nand we take off the Arab states there,\ncoming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately,\nand we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here,\nby adding the social values there, child survival.\nNow I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there.\nIn some countries, 99.7 percent of children survive to five years of age;\nothers, only 70. And here it seems there is a gap\nbetween OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,\nArab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe linearity is very strong between child survival and money."
p449
aS'\nBut let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there.\nI can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.\nAnd when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population.\nSierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country\nto get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar --\nthey could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.'
p450
aS"\nThere's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle.\nIn Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.\nHere in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there,\nyou can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation\nwithin Africa which we rarely often make -- that it's equal everything.\nI can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle.\nBut a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.\nI can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture,\nsame religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors.\nYemen, civil war. United Arab Emirate, money which was quite equally and well used.\nNot as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.\nData is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad.\nThere is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here:\nCambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger\nthan the weakness of the data. East Europe:\nSoviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years\nvery, very differently. And there is Latin America.\nToday, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.\nChile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.\nAnd here we have high-income countries in the OECD."
p451
aS"\nAnd we get the whole pattern here of the world,\nwhich is more or less like this. And if we look at it,\nhow it looks -- the world, in 1960, it starts to move. 1960.\nThis is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died.\nAnd then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again.\nAnd we have seen how countries move in different directions like this,\nso it's sort of difficult to get\nan example country which shows the pattern of the world.\nBut I would like to bring you back to about here at 1960.\nI would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil,\nwhich is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda,\nwhich is there. And I can run it forward, like this.\nAnd you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement,\nwhereas Brazil is much slower."
p452
aS"\nAnd if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this,\nyou can see again that the speed of development\nis very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less\nin the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move\nmuch faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.\nAnd to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirate.\nThey came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil;\nthey got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.\nYou have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling.\nYou have to train health staff. You have to educate the population.\nAnd Sheikh Sayed did that in a fairly good way.\nIn spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.\nSo we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world,\nwhere all countries tend to use their money\nbetter than they used in the past. Now, this is, more or less,\nif you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this."
p453
aS"\nNow that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot\nof difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see\nthat Uganda today is where South Korea was 1960. If I split Uganda,\nthere's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda.\nThe richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.\nThe poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this.\nAnd if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine,\nlastly, it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here,\nand the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there,\nand yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa.\nEverything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't\ndiscuss universal access to HIV [medicine] for that quintile up here\nwith the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world\nmust be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it\non regional level. We must be much more detailed.\nWe find that students get very excited when they can use this."
p454
aS"\nAnd even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see\nhow the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place?\nWhy are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations,\nin the national statistical agencies\nand in universities and other non-governmental organizations.\nBecause the data is hidden down in the databases.\nAnd the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively."
p455
aS'\nAll that information we saw changing in the world\ndoes not include publicly-funded statistics. There are some web pages\nlike this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases,\nbut people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p456
aS'\nAnd this won\'t work. So what is needed? We have the databases.\nIt\'s not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools,\nand more and more are added up here. So we started\na nonprofit venture which we called -- linking data to design --\nwe call it Gapminder, from the London underground, where they warn you,\n"mind the gap." So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.\nAnd we started to write software which could link the data like this.\nAnd it wasn\'t that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations.\nYou can take a data set and put it there.\nWe are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.'
p457
aS'\nSome countries accept that their databases can go out on the world,\nbut what we really need is, of course, a search function.\nA search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format\nand get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around?\nI\'ve done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says,\n"It\'s impossible. This can\'t be done. Our information is so peculiar\nin detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched.\nWe cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world."\nBut this is what we would like to see, isn\'t it?\nThe publicly-funded data is down here.\nAnd we would like flowers to grow out on the Net.\nAnd one of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use\nthe different design tool to animate it there.\nAnd I have a pretty good news for you. I have a good news that the present,\nnew Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn\'t say it\'s impossible.\nHe only says, "We can\'t do it."\n(Laughter)\nAnd that\'s a quite clever guy, huh?\n(Laughter)'
p458
aS"\nSo we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.\nWe will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.\nThis is the income distribution of China, 1970.\nthe income distribution of the United States, 1970.\nAlmost no overlap. Almost no overlap. And what has happened?\nWhat has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer,\nand it's appearing here, overlooking the United States.\nAlmost like a ghost, isn't it, huh?\n(Laughter)"
p459
aS"\nIt's pretty scary. But I think it's very important to have all this information.\nWe need really to see it. And instead of looking at this,\nI would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000.\nIn this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily.\nIt takes some time to change for this,\nbut on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.\nAnd the thing would be to get up the databases free,\nto get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them\ninto the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.\nNow, statisticians doesn't like it, because they say that this\nwill not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods.\nBut this is hypothesis-generating."
p460
aS"\nI end now with the world. There, the Internet is coming.\nThe number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita.\nAnd it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well\nit fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the 100 dollar\ncomputer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency.\nIt's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries\nare lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting\nto follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do\nwith all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much.\n(Applause)"

S"\nWhen I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old,\nwe were playing on top of a bunk bed.\nI was two years older than my sister at the time --\nI mean, I'm two years older than her now --\nbut at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do,\nand I wanted to play war.\nSo we were up on top of our bunk beds.\nAnd on one side of the bunk bed,\nI had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.\nAnd on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies\nready for a cavalry charge."
p463
aS"\nThere are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon,\nbut since my sister is not here with us today,\nlet me tell you the true story --\n(Laughter) --\nwhich is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side.\nSomehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all,\nsuddenly Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed\nand landed with this crash on the floor.\nNow I nervously peered over the side of the bed\nto see what had befallen my fallen sister\nand saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees\non all fours on the ground."
p464
aS"\nI was nervous because my parents had charged me\nwith making sure that my sister and I\nplayed as safely and as quietly as possible.\nAnd seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm\njust one week before ...\n(Laughter)\n... heroically pushing her out of the way\nof an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,\n(Laughter)\nfor which I have yet to be thanked,\nI was trying as hard as I could --\nshe didn't even see it coming --\nI was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior."
p465
aS'\nAnd I saw my sister\'s face,\nthis wail of pain and suffering and surprise\nthreatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake\nmy parents from the long winter\'s nap for which they had settled.\nSo I did the only thing\nmy little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.\nAnd if you have children, you\'ve seen this hundreds of times before.\nI said, "Amy, Amy, wait. Don\'t cry. Don\'t cry.\nDid you see how you landed?\nNo human lands on all fours like that.\nAmy, I think this means you\'re a unicorn."'

aS'\nNow that was cheating, because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more\nthan not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister,\nbut Amy the special unicorn.\nOf course, this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.\nAnd you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict,\nas her little brain attempted to devote resources\nto feeling the pain and suffering and surprise\nshe just experienced,\nor contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.\nAnd the latter won out.\nInstead of crying, instead of ceasing our play,\ninstead of waking my parents,\nwith all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me,\ninstead a smile spread across her face\nand she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...\n(Laughter)\n... with one broken leg.'
p468
aS"\nWhat we stumbled across\nat this tender age of just five and seven --\nwe had no idea at the time --\nwas something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution\noccurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.\nWhat we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology,\nwhich is the reason that I'm here today\nand the reason that I wake up every morning."
p469
aS"\nWhen I first started talking about this research\noutside of academia, out with companies and schools,\nthe very first thing they said to never do\nis to start your talk with a graph.\nThe very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph.\nThis graph looks boring,\nbut this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.\nAnd this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data.\nWhat we found is --"
p470
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p471
aS"\nIf I got this data back studying you here in the room, I would be thrilled,\nbecause there's very clearly a trend that's going on there,\nand that means that I can get published,\nwhich is all that really matters.\nThe fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve,\nthere's one weirdo in the room --\nI know who you are, I saw you earlier --\nthat's no problem.\nThat's no problem, as most of you know,\nbecause I can just delete that dot.\nI can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.\nAnd we know that's a measurement error\nbecause it's messing up my data."
p472
aS"\nSo one of the very first things we teach people\nin economics and statistics and business and psychology courses\nis how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.\nHow do we eliminate the outliers\nso we can find the line of best fit?\nWhich is fantastic if I'm trying to find out\nhow many Advil the average person should be taking -- two.\nBut if I'm interested in potential, if I'm interested in your potential,\nor for happiness or productivity\nor energy or creativity,\nwhat we're doing is we're creating the cult of the average with science."
p473
aS'\nIf I asked a question like,\n"How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"\nscientists change the answer to "How fast does the average child\nlearn how to read in that classroom?"\nand then we tailor the class right towards the average.\nNow if you fall below the average on this curve,\nthen psychologists get thrilled,\nbecause that means you\'re either depressed or you have a disorder,\nor hopefully both.\nWe\'re hoping for both because our business model is,\nif you come into a therapy session with one problem,\nwe want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10,\nso you keep coming back over and over again.\nWe\'ll go back into your childhood if necessary,\nbut eventually what we want to do is make you normal again.\nBut normal is merely average.'
p474
aS'\nAnd what I posit and what positive psychology posits\nis that if we study what is merely average,\nwe will remain merely average.\nThen instead of deleting those positive outliers,\nwhat I intentionally do is come into a population like this one\nand say, why?\nWhy is it that some of you are so high above the curve\nin terms of your intellectual ability, athletic ability, musical ability,\ncreativity, energy levels,\nyour resiliency in the face of challenge, your sense of humor?\nWhatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.\nBecause maybe we can glean information --\nnot just how to move people up to the average,\nbut how we can move the entire average up\nin our companies and schools worldwide.'
p475
aS"\nThe reason this graph is important to me\nis, when I turn on the news, it seems like the majority of the information\nis not positive, in fact it's negative.\nMost of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.\nAnd very quickly, my brain starts to think\nthat's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.\nWhat that's doing is creating something\ncalled the medical school syndrome --\nwhich, if you know people who've been to medical school,\nduring the first year of medical training,\nas you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen,\nsuddenly you realize you have all of them."
p476
aS'\nI have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story.\nBobo married Amy the unicorn.\nBobo called me on the phone\nfrom Yale Medical School,\nand Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."\n(Laughter)\nWhich, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.\nBut I had no idea how to console poor Bobo\nbecause he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.'

aS"\nSee what we're finding is it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us,\nbut the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.\nAnd if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness,\nwe can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time."
p479
aS"\nWhen I applied to Harvard, I applied on a dare.\nI didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.\nWhen I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they allowed me to go.\nSuddenly, something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.\nWhen I went there, I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well,\nthat they'd be excited to be there.\nEven if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you,\nyou'd be happy just to be in that classroom, which is what I felt.\nBut what I found there\nis, while some people experience that,\nwhen I graduated after my four years\nand then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students --\nHarvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.\n(Laughter)\nI was an officer of Harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years.\nAnd what I found in my research and my teaching\nis that these students, no matter how happy they were\nwith their original success of getting into the school,\ntwo weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there,\nnor on their philosophy or their physics.\nTheir brain was focused on the competition, the workload,\nthe hassles, the stresses, the complaints."
p480
aS'\nWhen I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall,\nwhich is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up --\nI know some of you have heard of it.\nWhen they\'d come to visit me, they\'d look around,\nthey\'d say, "This freshman dining hall looks like something\nout of Hogwart\'s from the movie "Harry Potter," which it does.\nThis is Hogwart\'s from the movie "Harry Potter" and that\'s Harvard.\nAnd when they see this,\nthey say, "Shawn, why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?\nSeriously, what does a Harvard student possibly have\nto be unhappy about?"'
p481
aS'\nEmbedded within that question\nis the key to understanding the science of happiness.\nBecause what that question assumes\nis that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels,\nwhen in reality, if I know everything about your external world,\nI can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness.\n90 percent of your long-term happiness\nis predicted not by the external world,\nbut by the way your brain processes the world.\nAnd if we change it,\nif we change our formula for happiness and success,\nwhat we can do is change the way\nthat we can then affect reality.\nWhat we found is that only 25 percent of job successes\nare predicted by I.Q.\n75 percent of job successes\nare predicted by your optimism levels, your social support\nand your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.'
p482
aS'\nI talked to a boarding school up in New England, probably the most prestigious boarding school,\nand they said, "We already know that.\nSo every year, instead of just teaching our students, we also have a wellness week.\nAnd we\'re so excited. Monday night we have the world\'s leading expert\ncoming in to speak about adolescent depression.\nTuesday night it\'s school violence and bullying.\nWednesday night is eating disorders.\nThursday night is elicit drug use.\nAnd Friday night we\'re trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."\n(Laughter)\nI said, "That\'s most people\'s Friday nights."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nWhich I\'m glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.\nSilence on the phone.\nAnd into the silence, I said, "I\'d be happy to speak at your school,\nbut just so you know, that\'s not a wellness week, that\'s a sickness week.\nWhat you\'ve done is you\'ve outlined all the negative things that can happen,\nbut not talked about the positive."'
p483
aS"\nThe absence of disease is not health.\nHere's how we get to health:\nWe need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.\nIn the last three years, I've traveled to 45 different countries,\nworking with schools and companies\nin the midst of an economic downturn.\nAnd what I found is that most companies and schools\nfollow a formula for success, which is this:\nIf I work harder, I'll be more successful.\nAnd if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.\nThat undergirds most of our parenting styles, our managing styles,\nthe way that we motivate our behavior."
p484
aS"\nAnd the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.\nFirst, every time your brain has a success,\nyou just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.\nYou got good grades, now you have to get better grades,\nyou got into a good school and after you get into a better school,\nyou got a good job, now you have to get a better job,\nyou hit your sales target, we're going to change your sales target.\nAnd if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.\nWhat we've done is we've pushed happiness\nover the cognitive horizon as a society.\nAnd that's because we think we have to be successful,\nthen we'll be happier."
p485
aS"\nBut the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order.\nIf you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present,\nthen their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage,\nwhich is your brain at positive\nperforms significantly better\nthan it does at negative, neutral or stressed.\nYour intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.\nIn fact, what we've found\nis that every single business outcome improves.\nYour brain at positive is 31 percent more productive\nthan your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.\nYou're 37 percent better at sales.\nDoctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate\nat coming up with the correct diagnosis\nwhen positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.\nWhich means we can reverse the formula.\nIf we can find a way of becoming positive in the present,\nthen our brains work even more successfully\nas we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently."
p486
aS"\nWhat we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula\nso we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of.\nBecause dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive,\nhas two functions.\nNot only does it make you happier,\nit turns on all of the learning centers in your brain\nallowing you to adapt to the world in a different way."
p487
aS"\nWe've found that there are ways that you can train your brain\nto be able to become more positive.\nIn just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row,\nwe can actually rewire your brain,\nallowing your brain to actually work\nmore optimistically and more successfully.\nWe've done these things in research now\nin every single company that I've worked with,\ngetting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for\nfor 21 days in a row, three new things each day.\nAnd at the end of that,\ntheir brain starts to retain a pattern\nof scanning the world, not for the negative, but for the positive first."
p488
aS"\nJournaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours\nallows your brain to relive it.\nExercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.\nWe find that meditation allows your brain\nto get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating\nby trying to do multiple tasks at once\nand allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.\nAnd finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.\nWe get people, when they open up their inbox,\nto write one positive email\npraising or thanking somebody in their social support network."
p489
aS"\nAnd by doing these activities\nand by training your brain just like we train our bodies,\nwhat we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success,\nand in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity,\nbut create a real revolution."

S'\nI\'ve been intrigued by this question\nof whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense --\na sense that would give us seamless access\nand easy access to meta-information\nor information that may exist somewhere\nthat may be relevant to help us make the right decision\nabout whatever it is that we\'re coming across.\nAnd some of you may argue,\nwell, don\'t today\'s cell phones do that already?\nBut I would say no.\nWhen you meet someone here at TED --\nand this is the top networking place, of course, of the year --\nyou don\'t shake somebody\'s hand\nand then say, "Can you hold on for a moment\nwhile I take out my phone and Google you?"\nOr when you go to the supermarket\nand you\'re standing there in that huge aisle\nof different types of toilet papers,\nyou don\'t take out your cell phone, and open a browser,\nand go to a website to try to decide\nwhich of these different toilet papers\nis the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.'
p494
aS"\nSo we don't really have easy access\nto all this relevant information\nthat can just help us make optimal decisions\nabout what to do next and what actions to take.\nAnd so my research group at the Media Lab\nhas been developing a series of inventions\nto give us access to this information\nin a sort of easy way,\nwithout requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.\nAnd I'm here to unveil\nour latest effort,\nand most successful effort so far,\nwhich is still very much a work in process.\nI'm actually wearing the device right now\nand we've sort of cobbled it together\nwith components that are off the shelf --\nand that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars\nat this point in time."
p495
aS"\nI'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam,\na portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.\nThese components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket\nwhich acts as the communication and computation device.\nAnd in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,\nwho's really the genius who's been implementing\nand designing this whole system.\nAnd we see how this system\nlets him walk up to any surface\nand start using his hands to interact with the information\nthat is projected in front of him.\nThe system tracks the four significant fingers.\nIn this case, he's wearing simple marker caps\nthat you may recognize.\nBut if you want a more stylish version\nyou could also paint your nails in different colors."
p496
aS'\nAnd the camera basically tracks these four fingers\nand recognizes any gestures that he\'s making\nso he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,\nzoom in and out, etc.\nThe system also recognizes iconic gestures\nsuch as the "take a picture" gesture,\nand then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.\nAnd when he then walks back to the Media Lab,\nhe can just go up to any wall\nand project all the pictures that he\'s taken,\nsort through them and organize them,\nand re-size them, etc.,\nagain using all natural gestures.\nSo, some of you most likely were here two years ago\nand saw the demo by Jeff Han\nor some of you may think, "Well, doesn\'t this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"\nAnd yes, you also interact using natural gestures,\nboth hands, etc.\nBut the difference here is that you can use any surface,\nyou can walk to up to any surface,\nincluding your hand if nothing else is available\nand interact with this projected data.\nThe device is completely portable,\nand can be ...\n(Applause)'
p497
aS'\nSo one important difference is that it\'s totally mobile.\nAnother even more important difference is that in mass production\nthis would not cost more tomorrow than today\'s cell phones\nand would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging --\ncould look a lot more stylish\nthan this version that I\'m wearing around my neck.\nBut other than letting some of you live out your fantasy\nof looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"\nthe reason why we\'re really excited about this device\nis that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices\nthat gives you relevant information\nabout whatever is in front of you.\nSo we see Pranav here going into the supermarket\nand he\'s shopping for some paper towels.\nAnd, as he picks up a product the system can recognize\nthe product that he\'s picking up,\nusing either image recognition or marker technology,\nand give him the green light or an orange light.\nHe can ask for additional information.\nSo this particular choice here\nis a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.\nSome of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it\nrather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.'

p499
aS"\nIf he picks up a book in the bookstore,\nhe can get an Amazon rating --\nit gets projected right on the cover of the book.\nThis is Juan's book, our previous speaker,\nwhich gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.\nAnd so, Pranav turns the page of the book\nand can then see additional information about the book --\nreader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.\nIf he turns to a particular page\nhe finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours\nthat gives him a little bit of additional information\nabout whatever is on that particular page.\nReading the newspaper --\nit never has to be outdated."
p500
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p501
aS"\nYou can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about\nYou can get the latest sports scores etc.\nThis is a more controversial one."
p502
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p503
aS"\nAs you interact with someone at TED,\nmaybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,\nthe words that are associated with that person\nin their blog and personal web pages.\nIn this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.\nOn your way to the airport,\nif you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,\nthat the gate has changed, etc.\nAnd, if you need to know what the current time is\nit's as simple as drawing a watch --\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\non your arm."
p504
aS"\nSo that's where we're at so far\nin developing this sixth sense\nthat would give us seamless access to all this relevant information\nabout the things that we may come across.\nMy student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this."

S"\nHi. My name is Cameron Russell,\nand for the last little while\nI've been a model.\nActually, for 10 years.\nAnd I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension\nin the room right now\nbecause I should not have worn this dress. (Laughter)"
p510
aS"\nSo luckily I brought an outfit change.\nThis is the first outfit change on the TED stage,\nso you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.\nIf some of the women were really horrified when I came out,\nyou don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.\n(Laughter)"
p511
aS"\nI'd also note that I'm quite privileged\nto be able to transform what you think of me\nin a very brief 10 seconds.\nNot everybody gets to do that.\nThese heels are very uncomfortable,\nso good thing I wasn't going to wear them.\nThe worst part is putting this sweater over my head,\nbecause that's when you'll all laugh at me,\nso don't do anything while it's over my head.\nAll right."
p512
aS"\nSo why did I do that?\nThat was awkward.\nWell,\nhopefully not as awkward as that picture.\nImage is powerful,\nbut also image is superficial.\nI just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds.\nAnd in this picture,\nI had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.\nI was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer\nwas telling me to arch my back and put my hand\nin that guy's hair.\nAnd of course, barring surgery,\nor the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,\nthere's very little that we can do to transform how we look,\nand how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,\nhas a huge impact on our lives."
p513
aS"\nSo today, for me, being fearless means being honest.\nAnd I am on this stage because I am a model.\nI am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,\nand in my industry we call that a sexy girl.\nAnd I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,\nbut with an honest twist."
p514
aS'\nSo the first question is, how do you become a model?\nAnd I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing.\nThe real way that I became a model is\nI won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,\nand maybe you\'re wondering what is a legacy.\nWell, for the past few centuries\nwe have defined beauty not just as health and youth\nand symmetry that we\'re biologically programmed to admire,\nbut also as tall, slender figures,\nand femininity and white skin.\nAnd this is a legacy that was built for me,\nand it\'s a legacy that I\'ve been cashing out on.\nAnd I know there are people in the audience\nwho are skeptical at this point,\nand maybe there are some fashionistas who are, like,\n"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."\nAnd first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.\n(Laughter)\nBut unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007,\na very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted\nall the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,\nand of the 677 models that were hired,\nonly 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.'
p515
aS'\nThe next question people always ask me is,\n"Can I be a model when I grow up?"\nAnd the first answer is, "I don\'t know, they don\'t put me in charge of that."\nBut the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, "Why?\nYou know? You can be anything.\nYou could be the President of the United States,\nor the inventor of the next Internet,\nor a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet,\nwhich would be awesome, because you\'d be the first one."\n(Laughter)\nIf, after this amazing list, they still are like,\n"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"\nwell then I say, "Be my boss."\nBecause I\'m not in charge of anything,\nand you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue\nor the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel.\nSaying that you want to be a model when you grow up\nis akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.\nIt\'s out of your control, and it\'s awesome,\nand it\'s not a career path.\nI will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,\nbecause unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons,\nit can just be distilled right into -- right now.\nSo if the photographer is right there\nand the light is right there, like a nice HMI,\nand the client says, "Cameron, we want a walking shot,"\nwell then this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,\nthe head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth,\njust do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends,\n300, 400, 500 times. (Laughter)\nIt will look something like this. (Laughter)\nHopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.\nThat was, I don\'t know what happened there.'
p516
aS'\nUnfortunately after you\'ve gone to school,\nand you have a rsum and you\'ve done a few jobs,\nyou can\'t say anything anymore,\nso if you say you want to be the President of the United States,\nbut your rsum reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"\npeople give you a funny look.'
p517
aS'\nThe next question people always ask me is, "Do they retouch all the photos?"\nAnd yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,\nbut that is only a small component of what\'s happening.\nThis picture is the very first picture that I ever took,\nand it\'s also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,\nand I didn\'t even have my period yet.\nI know we\'re getting personal, but\nI was a young girl.\nThis is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.\nHere\'s me on the same day as this shoot.\nMy friend got to come with me.\nHere\'s me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.\nHere\'s me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.\nAnd here\'s me today.\nAnd I hope what you\'re seeing is that\nthese pictures are not pictures of me.\nThey are constructions,\nand they are constructions by a group of professionals,\nby hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists\nand all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,\nand they build this. That\'s not me.'
p518
aS'\nOkay, so the next question people always ask me is,\n"Do you get free stuff?"\nI do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,\nexcept for earlier,\nbut the free stuff that I get\nis the free stuff that I get in real life, and that\'s what we don\'t like to talk about.\nI grew up in Cambridge,\nand one time I went into a store and I forgot my money\nand they gave me the dress for free.\nWhen I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend\nwho was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,\nwe got pulled over,\nand all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"\nand we were on our way.\nAnd I got these free things because of how I look,\nnot who I am, and there are people paying a cost\nfor how they look and not who they are.\nI live in New York, and last year,\nof the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,\n86 percent of them were black and Latino,\nand most of them were young men.\nAnd there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,\nso for them, it\'s not a question of, "Will I get stopped?"\nbut "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"\nWhen I was researching this talk,\nI found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,\n53 percent don\'t like their bodies,\nand that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they\'re 17.'
p519
aS'\nSo the last question people ask me is,\n"What is it like to be a model?"\nAnd I think the answer that they\'re looking for is,\n"If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,\nyou will be so happy and fabulous."\nAnd when we\'re backstage, we give an answer\nthat maybe makes it seem like that.\nWe say, "It\'s really amazing to travel,\nand it\'s amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."\nAnd those things are true, but they\'re only one half of the story,\nbecause the thing that we never say on camera,\nthat I have never said on camera,\nis, "I am insecure."\nAnd I\'m insecure because I have to think about\nwhat I look like every day.\nAnd if you ever are wondering,\n"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"\nyou just need to meet a group of models,\nbecause they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,\nand they\'re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.'
p520
aS'\nSo when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult\nto strike an honest balance, because on the one hand,\nI felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,\n"Look I\'ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"\nand it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,\n"and it doesn\'t always make me happy."\nBut mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy\nof gender and racial oppression\nwhen I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.\nBut I\'m also happy and honored to be up here\nand I think that it\'s great that I got to come\nbefore 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I\'d had more agency in my career,\nbecause maybe then I wouldn\'t tell the story of how I got my first job,\nor maybe I wouldn\'t tell the story of how I paid for college,\nwhich seems so important right now.'
p521
aS"\nIf there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that\nwe all feel more comfortable acknowledging\nthe power of image in our perceived successes\nand our perceived failures."

aS"\nAs a young magician\nI was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.\nSo, I began, early on, competing against the other kids,\nseeing how long I could stay underwater\nwhile they went up and down to breathe,\nyou know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.\nBy the time I was a teenager\nI was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.\nI would later find out that was Houdini's personal record."
p528
aS'\nIn 1987 I heard of a story\nabout a boy that fell through ice\nand was trapped under a river.\nHe was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes.\nWhen the rescue workers came\nthey resuscitated him and there was no brain damage.\nHis core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees.\nAs a magician, I think everything is possible.\nAnd I think if something is done by one person\nit can be done by others.\nI started to think, if the boy could survive\nwithout breathing for that long,\nthere must be a way that I could do it.'
p529
aS"\nSo, I met with a top neurosurgeon.\nAnd I asked him, how long is it possible\nto go without breathing, like how long could I go without air?\nAnd he said to me that anything over six minutes\nyou have a serious risk\nof hypoxic brain damage.\nSo, I took that as a challenge, basically.\n(Laughter)\nMy first try, I figured that I could do something similar,\nand I created a water tank,\nand I filled it with ice and freezing cold water.\nAnd I stayed inside of that water tank\nhoping my core temperature would start to drop.\nAnd I was shivering. In my first attempt to hold my breath\nI couldn't even last a minute.\nSo, I realized that was completely not going to work."
p530
aS'\nSo, I went to talk to a doctor friend,\nand I asked him how could I do that?\n"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?"\nAnd he said, "David, you\'re a magician,\ncreate the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."\n(Laughter)\nSo, he came up with this idea\nof creating a rebreather,\nwith a CO2 scrubber,\nwhich was basically a tube from Home Depot,\nwith a balloon duct-taped to it,\nthat he thought we could put inside of me,\nand somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe\nwith this thing in me.\nThis is a little hard to watch.\nBut this is that attempt.\nSo, that clearly wasn\'t going to work.\n(Laughter)'
p531
aS"\nThen I actually started thinking about\nliquid breathing.\nThere is a chemical that's called perflubron.\nAnd it's so high in oxygen levels\nthat in theory you could breathe it.\nSo, I got my hands on that chemical,\nfilled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink\nand tried to breathe that in,\nwhich was really impossible.\nIt's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said,\nwhile having an elephant standing on your chest.\nSo, that idea disappeared."
p532
aS'\nThen I started thinking,\nwould it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine\nand have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery,\nand then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?\nWhich was another insane idea, obviously.'
p533
aS"\nThen I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas:\nto actually do it.\n(Laughter)\nTo actually try to hold my breath past the point\nthat doctors would consider you brain dead.\nSo, I started researching\ninto pearl divers.\nYou know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.\nAnd when I was researching pearl divers, I found the world\nof free-diving.\nIt was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered, pretty much.\nThere is many different aspects to free-diving.\nThere is depth records, where people go as deep as they can.\nAnd then there is static apnea.\nThat's holding your breath as long as you can\nin one place without moving.\nThat was the one that I studied."
p534
aS"\nThe first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath\nyou should never move at all; that wastes energy.\nAnd that depletes oxygen,\nand it builds up CO2 in your blood. So, I learned never to move.\nAnd I learned how to slow my heart rate down.\nI had to remain perfectly still and just relax\nand think that I wasn't in my body,\nand just control that.\nAnd then I learned how to purge.\nPurging is basically hyperventilating.\nYou blow in and out ...\nYou do that, you get lightheaded, you get tingling.\nAnd you're really ridding your body of CO2.\nSo, when you hold your breath it's infinitely easier.\nThen I learned that you have to take a huge breath,\nand just hold and relax and never let any air out,\nand just hold and relax through all the pain."
p535
aS"\nEvery morning, this is for months,\nI would wake up and the first thing that I would do\nis I would hold my breath\nfor, out of 52 minutes,\nI would hold my breath for 44 minutes.\nSo, basically what that means is I would purge,\nI'd breath really hard for a minute.\nAnd I would hold, immediately after, for five and half minutes.\nThen I would breath again for a minute,\npurging as hard as I can,\nthen immediately after that I would hold again for five and half minutes.\nI would repeat this process eight times in a row.\nOut of 52 minutes you're only breathing for eight minutes.\nAt the end of that you're completely fried, your brain.\nYou feel like you're walking around in a daze.\nAnd you have these awful headaches.\nBasically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff."
p536
aS"\nI started learning about the world-record holder.\nHis name is Tom Sietas.\nAnd this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.\nHe's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.\nAnd his total lung capacity\nis twice the size of an average person.\nI'm six foot one, and fat.\nWe'll say big-boned.\n(Laughter)\nI had to drop 50 pounds in three months.\nSo, everything that I put into my body\nI considered as medicine.\nEvery bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value.\nI ate really small controlled portions\nthroughout the day.\nAnd I started to really adapt my body.\n(Laughter)"
p537
aS'\nThe thinner I was, the longer I was able to hold my breath.\nAnd by eating so well and training so hard,\nmy resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute.\nWhich is lower than most Olympic athletes.\nIn four months of training I was able to hold my breath\nfor over seven minutes.\nI wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.\nI wanted to try it in the most extreme situations\nto see if I could slow my heart rate down\nunder duress.\n(Laughter)'
p538
aS'\nI decided that I was going to break the world record\nlive on prime-time television.\nThe world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds,\nheld by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about.\n(Laughter)\nI assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center\nand if I stayed there a week not eating,\nI would get comfortable in that situation\nand I would slow my metabolism,\nwhich I was sure would help me hold my breath\nlonger than I had been able to do it.\nI was completely wrong.'
p539
aS'\nI entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date.\nAnd I thought everything seemed to be on track.\nTwo days before my big breath hold attempt, for the record,\nthe producers of my television special\nthought that just watching somebody\nholding their breath, and almost drowning,\nis too boring for television.\n(Laughter)\nSo, I had to add handcuffs,\nwhile holding my breath, to escape from.\nThis was a critical mistake.\nBecause of the movement I was wasting oxygen.\nAnd by seven minutes I had gone\ninto these awful convulsions.\nBy 7:08 I started to black out.\nAnd by seven minutes and 30 seconds\nthey had to pull my body out and bring me back.\nI had failed on every level.\n(Laughter)'
p540
aS'\nSo, naturally, the only way out of the slump\nthat I could think of\nwas, I decided to call Oprah.\n(Laughter)\nI told her that I wanted to up the ante\nand hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.\nThis was a different record. This was a pure O2\nstatic apnea record that Guinness\nhad set the world record at 13 minutes.\nSo, basically you breath pure O2 first,\noxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,\nand you are able to hold much longer.\nI realized that my real competition\nwas the beaver.\n(Laughter)'
p541
aS"\nIn January of '08\nOprah gave me four months to prepare and train.\nSo, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.\nA hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates\naltitude at 15,000 feet.\nSo, it's like base camp Everest.\nWhat that does is, you start building up\nthe red blood cell count in your body,\nwhich helps you carry oxygen better.\nEvery morning, again, after getting out of that tent\nyour brain is completely wiped out.\nMy first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes.\nSo, it was a pretty big success."
p542
aS"\nThe neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water\nbecause in his mind, at 15 minutes\nyour brain is done, you're brain dead.\nSo, he pulled me up, and I was fine.\nThere was one person there that was definitely not impressed.\nIt was my ex-girlfriend. While I was breaking the record underwater\nfor the first time, she was sifting through my Blackberry,\nchecking all my messages.\n(Laughter)\nMy brother had a picture of it. It is really ...\n(Laughter)"
p543
aS"\nI then announced that I was going to go for\nSietas' record, publicly.\nAnd what he did in response,\nis he went on Regis and Kelly,\nand broke his old record.\nThen his main competitor went out and broke his record.\nSo, he suddenly pushed the record up to\n16 minutes and 32 seconds.\nWhich was three minutes longer than I had prepared.\nYou know, it was longer than the record."
p544
aS"\nNow, I wanted to get the Science Times to document this.\nI wanted to get them to do a piece on it.\nSo, I did what any person\nseriously pursuing scientific advancement would do.\nI walked into the New York Times offices\nand did card tricks to everybody.\n(Laughter)\nSo, I don't know if it was the magic or the lore of the Cayman islands,\nbut John Tierney flew down\nand did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding."
p545
aS"\nWhile he was there I tried to impress him, of course.\nAnd I did a dive down to 160 feet,\nwhich is basically the height of a 16 story building,\nand as I was coming up, I blacked out underwater,\nwhich is really dangerous; that's how you drown.\nLuckily Kirk had seen me\nand he swam over and pulled me up.\nSo, I started full focus.\nI completely trained to get my breath hold time up\nfor what I needed to do.\nBut there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it,\nbeing on Oprah."
p546
aS'\nBut in practice, I would do it face down, floating on the pool.\nBut for TV they wanted me to be upright\nso they could see my face, basically.\nThe other problem was\nthe suit was so buoyant\nthat they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up.\nSo, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose,\nwhich was a real problem for me.\nThat made me extremely nervous,\nraising the heart rate.'
p547
aS"\nThen, what they also did was,\nwhich we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor.\nAnd it was right next to the sphere.\nSo, every time my heart would beat I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,\nyou know, the ticking, really loud.\nWhich was making me more nervous.\nAnd there is no way to slow my heart rate down.\nSo, normally\nI would start at 38 beats per minute,\nand while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute,\nwhich is pretty unusual.\n(Laughter)\nThis time it started at 120 beats,\nand it never went down."
p548
aS'\nI spent the first five minutes underwater\ndesperately trying to slow my heart rate down.\nI was just sitting there thinking, "I\'ve got to slow this down.\nI\'m going to fail, I\'m going to fail."\nAnd I was getting more nervous.\nAnd the heart rate just kept going up and up,\nall the way up to 150 beats.\nBasically it\'s the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center.\nIt was a waste of O2.\nWhen I made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes,\nI was 100 percent certain\nthat I was not going to be able to make this.\nThere was no way for me to do it.'
p549
aS"\nSo, I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour\nto doing this breath hold thing, if I had cracked early\nit would be a whole show about how depressed I am.\n(Laughter)\nSo, I figured I'm better off just fighting\nand staying there until I black out,\nat least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.\n(Laughter)"
p550
aS'\nI kept pushing to 10 minutes. At 10 minutes\nyou start getting all these really strong\ntingling sensations in your fingers and toes.\nAnd I knew that that was blood shunting,\nwhen the blood rushes away from your extremities\nto provide oxygen to your vital organs.\nAt 11 minutes I started feeling\nthrobbing sensations in my legs,\nand my lips started to feel really strange.'
p551
aS"\nAt minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears,\nand I started to feel my arm going numb.\nAnd I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack.\nSo, I started to really get really paranoid.\nThen at 13 minutes, maybe because of the hypochondria.\nI started feeling pains all over my chest.\nIt was awful.\nAt 14 minutes,\nI had these awful contractions,\nlike this urge to breathe.\n(Laughter)"
p552
aS"\nAt 15 minutes I was suffering\nmajor O2 deprivation to the heart.\nAnd I started having ischemia to the heart.\nMy heartbeat would go from 120,\nto 50, to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.\nIt would skip a beat.\nIt would start. It would stop. And I felt all this.\nAnd I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.\nSo, at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out\nbecause I knew that if I did go out,\nif I did have a heart attack, they'd have to\njump into the binding and take my feet out\nbefore pulling me up. So, I was really nervous."
p553
aS'\nSo, I let my feet out, and I started floating to the top.\nAnd I didn\'t take my head out.\nBut I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop,\njust waiting.\nThey had doctors with the "Pst," you know, so,\nsitting there waiting.\nAnd then suddenly I hear screaming.\nAnd I think that there is some weird thing --\nthat I had died or something had happened.\nAnd then I realized that I had made it to 16:32.\nSo, with the energy of everybody that was there\nI decided to keep pushing.\nAnd I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.\n(Applause)'
p554
aS"\nAs though that wasn't enough, what I did immediately after\nis I went to Quest Labs\nand had them take every blood sample that they could\nto test for everything and to see where my levels were,\nso the doctors could use it, once again.\nI also didn't want anybody to question it.\nI had the world record and I wanted to\nmake sure it was legitimate."
p555
aS'\nSo, I get to New York City the next day,\nand this kid walks up to me -- I\'m walking out of the Apple store --\nthis kid walks up to me he\'s like, "Yo, D!"\nI\'m like "Yeah?"\nHe said, "If you really held your breath that long,\nwhy\'d you come out of the water dry?"\nI was like "What?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd that\'s my life. So ...\n(Laughter)'
p556
aS"\nAs a magician I try to show things to people\nthat seem impossible.\nAnd I think magic, whether I'm holding my breath\nor shuffling a deck of cards,\nis pretty simple.\nIt's practice, it's training, and it's --\nIt's practice, it's training and experimenting,\nwhile pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be.\nAnd that's what magic is to me, so, thank you.\n(Applause)"
p557
aa(lp558
S"\nBrain magic. What's brain magic all about?\nBrain magic to me indicates that area of magic\ndealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.\nSo unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words,\nlinguistic deception, non-verbal communication\nand various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense."
p559
aS"\nNow, I'm going to show you all how easy it is\nto manipulate the human mind once you know how.\nAnd I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody here.\nI want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all.\nOK, clap them together, once.\nOK, reverse your hands.\nNow, follow my actions exactly.\nNow about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that?\nOK, swap them around, put your right hand up.\nOK, now, cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over,\ninterlace your fingers like this,\nthen make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb --\nthat's very important.\nYours is the other way around, so swap it around.\nExcellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me.\nAll right. Tap them together once.\nOK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds,\nyou would all be able to do this.\n(Laughter)\nSo, now you can see how easy it is\nfor me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.\n(Laughter)"
p560
aS"\nNow, I remember when I was about 15,\nI read a copy of Life magazine,\nwhich detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman\nwho could sense printed letters --\nthere's still people trying to do it here --\n(Laughter)\n-- who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch.\nAnd she was completely blind.\nShe could also read the serial numbers on bills\nwhen they were placed, face down, on a hard surface.\nNow, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical.\nHow could somebody read using their fingertips?\nYou know, if you actually think about it,\nif somebody is totally blind --\na guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms,\nwhere people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things.\nAnd it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out.\nHow could somebody read using their fingertips?\nNow earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV,\nI attempted to give a similar demonstration\nof what is now known as second sight.\nSo, let's take a look."

p683
aa(lp684
S'\nI\'m a storyteller.\nAnd I would like to tell you a few personal stories\nabout what I like to call "the danger of the single story."\nI grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.\nMy mother says that I started reading at the age of two,\nalthough I think four is probably close to the truth.\nSo I was an early reader, and what I read\nwere British and American children\'s books.'
p685
aS"\nI was also an early writer,\nand when I began to write, at about the age of seven,\nstories in pencil with crayon illustrations\nthat my poor mother was obligated to read,\nI wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading:\nAll my characters were white and blue-eyed,\nthey played in the snow,\nthey ate apples,\nand they talked a lot about the weather,\nhow lovely it was\nthat the sun had come out.\n(Laughter)\nNow, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.\nI had never been outside Nigeria.\nWe didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,\nand we never talked about the weather,\nbecause there was no need to."
p686
aS'\nMy characters also drank a lot of ginger beer\nbecause the characters in the British books I read\ndrank ginger beer.\nNever mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.\n(Laughter)\nAnd for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire\nto taste ginger beer.\nBut that is another story.'
p687
aS"\nWhat this demonstrates, I think,\nis how impressionable and vulnerable we are\nin the face of a story,\nparticularly as children.\nBecause all I had read were books\nin which characters were foreign,\nI had become convinced that books\nby their very nature had to have foreigners in them\nand had to be about things with which\nI could not personally identify.\nThings changed when I discovered African books.\nThere weren't many of them available, and they weren't\nquite as easy to find as the foreign books."
p688
aS'\nBut because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye\nI went through a mental shift in my perception\nof literature.\nI realized that people like me,\ngirls with skin the color of chocolate,\nwhose kinky hair could not form ponytails,\ncould also exist in literature.\nI started to write about things I recognized.'
p689
aS'\nNow, I loved those American and British books I read.\nThey stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.\nBut the unintended consequence\nwas that I did not know that people like me\ncould exist in literature.\nSo what the discovery of African writers did for me was this:\nIt saved me from having a single story\nof what books are.'
p690
aS'\nI come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.\nMy father was a professor.\nMy mother was an administrator.\nAnd so we had, as was the norm,\nlive-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.\nSo the year I turned eight we got a new house boy.\nHis name was Fide.\nThe only thing my mother told us about him\nwas that his family was very poor.\nMy mother sent yams and rice,\nand our old clothes, to his family.\nAnd when I didn\'t finish my dinner my mother would say,\n"Finish your food! Don\'t you know? People like Fide\'s family have nothing."\nSo I felt enormous pity for Fide\'s family.'
p691
aS'\nThen one Saturday we went to his village to visit,\nand his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket\nmade of dyed raffia that his brother had made.\nI was startled.\nIt had not occurred to me that anybody in his family\ncould actually make something.\nAll I had heard about them was how poor they were,\nso that it had become impossible for me to see them\nas anything else but poor.\nTheir poverty was my single story of them.'
p692
aS'\nYears later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria\nto go to university in the United States.\nI was 19.\nMy American roommate was shocked by me.\nShe asked where I had learned to speak English so well,\nand was confused when I said that Nigeria\nhappened to have English as its official language.\nShe asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music,"\nand was consequently very disappointed\nwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.\n(Laughter)\nShe assumed that I did not know how\nto use a stove.'
p693
aS'\nWhat struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me\neven before she saw me.\nHer default position toward me, as an African,\nwas a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.\nMy roommate had a single story of Africa:\na single story of catastrophe.\nIn this single story there was no possibility\nof Africans being similar to her in any way,\nno possibility of feelings more complex than pity,\nno possibility of a connection as human equals.'
p694
aS'\nI must say that before I went to the U.S. I didn\'t\nconsciously identify as African.\nBut in the U.S. whenever Africa came up people turned to me.\nNever mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.\nBut I did come to embrace this new identity,\nand in many ways I think of myself now as African.\nAlthough I still get quite irritable when\nAfrica is referred to as a country,\nthe most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight\nfrom Lagos two days ago, in which\nthere was an announcement on the Virgin flight\nabout the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."\n(Laughter)'
p695
aS"\nSo after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African,\nI began to understand my roommate's response to me.\nIf I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa\nwere from popular images,\nI too would think that Africa was a place of\nbeautiful landscapes, beautiful animals,\nand incomprehensible people,\nfighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS,\nunable to speak for themselves\nand waiting to be saved\nby a kind, white foreigner.\nI would see Africans in the same way that I,\nas a child, had seen Fide's family."
p696
aS'\nThis single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature.\nNow, here is a quote from\nthe writing of a London merchant called John Locke,\nwho sailed to west Africa in 1561\nand kept a fascinating account of his voyage.\nAfter referring to the black Africans\nas "beasts who have no houses,"\nhe writes, "They are also people without heads,\nhaving their mouth and eyes in their breasts."'
p697
aS'\nNow, I\'ve laughed every time I\'ve read this.\nAnd one must admire the imagination of John Locke.\nBut what is important about his writing is that\nit represents the beginning\nof a tradition of telling African stories in the West:\nA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives,\nof difference, of darkness,\nof people who, in the words of the wonderful poet\nRudyard Kipling,\nare "half devil, half child."'
p698
aS'\nAnd so I began to realize that my American roommate\nmust have throughout her life\nseen and heard different versions\nof this single story,\nas had a professor,\nwho once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."\nNow, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things\nwrong with the novel,\nthat it had failed in a number of places,\nbut I had not quite imagined that it had failed\nat achieving something called African authenticity.\nIn fact I did not know what\nAfrican authenticity was.\nThe professor told me that my characters\nwere too much like him,\nan educated and middle-class man.\nMy characters drove cars.\nThey were not starving.\nTherefore they were not authentically African.'
p699
aS'\nBut I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty\nin the question of the single story.\nA few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.\nThe political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense,\nand there were debates going on about immigration.\nAnd, as often happens in America,\nimmigration became synonymous with Mexicans.\nThere were endless stories of Mexicans\nas people who were\nfleecing the healthcare system,\nsneaking across the border,\nbeing arrested at the border, that sort of thing.'
p700
aS'\nI remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara,\nwatching the people going to work,\nrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,\nsmoking, laughing.\nI remember first feeling slight surprise.\nAnd then I was overwhelmed with shame.\nI realized that I had been so immersed\nin the media coverage of Mexicans\nthat they had become one thing in my mind,\nthe abject immigrant.\nI had bought into the single story of Mexicans\nand I could not have been more ashamed of myself.\nSo that is how to create a single story,\nshow a people as one thing,\nas only one thing,\nover and over again,\nand that is what they become.'
p701
aS'\nIt is impossible to talk about the single story\nwithout talking about power.\nThere is a word, an Igbo word,\nthat I think about whenever I think about\nthe power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."\nIt\'s a noun that loosely translates\nto "to be greater than another."\nLike our economic and political worlds,\nstories too are defined\nby the principle of nkali:\nHow they are told, who tells them,\nwhen they\'re told, how many stories are told,\nare really dependent on power.'
p702
aS'\nPower is the ability not just to tell the story of another person,\nbut to make it the definitive story of that person.\nThe Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes\nthat if you want to dispossess a people,\nthe simplest way to do it is to tell their story\nand to start with, "secondly."\nStart the story with the arrows of the Native Americans,\nand not with the arrival of the British,\nand you have an entirely different story.\nStart the story with\nthe failure of the African state,\nand not with the colonial creation of the African state,\nand you have an entirely different story.'
p703
aS'\nI recently spoke at a university where\na student told me that it was\nsuch a shame\nthat Nigerian men were physical abusers\nlike the father character in my novel.\nI told him that I had just read a novel\ncalled American Psycho --\n(Laughter)\n-- and that it was such a shame\nthat young Americans were serial murderers.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nNow, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.\n(Laughter)'
p704
aS"\nBut it would never have occurred to me to think\nthat just because I had read a novel\nin which a character was a serial killer\nthat he was somehow representative\nof all Americans.\nThis is not because I am a better person than that student,\nbut because of America's cultural and economic power,\nI had many stories of America.\nI had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.\nI did not have a single story of America."
p705
aS'\nWhen I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected\nto have had really unhappy childhoods\nto be successful,\nI began to think about how I could invent\nhorrible things my parents had done to me.\n(Laughter)\nBut the truth is that I had a very happy childhood,\nfull of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.'
p706
aS'\nBut I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.\nMy cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.\nOne of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash\nbecause our fire trucks did not have water.\nI grew up under repressive military governments\nthat devalued education,\nso that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries.\nAnd so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,\nthen margarine disappeared,\nthen bread became too expensive,\nthen milk became rationed.\nAnd most of all, a kind of normalized political fear\ninvaded our lives.'
p707
aS'\nAll of these stories make me who I am.\nBut to insist on only these negative stories\nis to flatten my experience\nand to overlook the many other stories\nthat formed me.\nThe single story creates stereotypes,\nand the problem with stereotypes\nis not that they are untrue,\nbut that they are incomplete.\nThey make one story become the only story.'
p708
aS'\nOf course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes:\nThere are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo\nand depressing ones, such as the fact that\n5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria.\nBut there are other stories that are not about catastrophe,\nand it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.'
p709
aS"\nI've always felt that it is impossible\nto engage properly with a place or a person\nwithout engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.\nThe consequence of the single story\nis this: It robs people of dignity.\nIt makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.\nIt emphasizes how we are different\nrather than how we are similar."
p710
aS'\nSo what if before my Mexican trip\nI had followed the immigration debate from both sides,\nthe U.S. and the Mexican?\nWhat if my mother had told us that Fide\'s family was poor\nand hardworking?\nWhat if we had an African television network\nthat broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?\nWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls\n"a balance of stories."'
p711
aS"\nWhat if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher,\nMukta Bakaray,\na remarkable man who left his job in a bank\nto follow his dream and start a publishing house?\nNow, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.\nHe disagreed. He felt\nthat people who could read, would read,\nif you made literature affordable and available to them."
p712
aS'\nShortly after he published my first novel\nI went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview,\nand a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said,\n"I really liked your novel. I didn\'t like the ending.\nNow you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."\n(Laughter)\nAnd she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.\nI was not only charmed, I was very moved.\nHere was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians,\nwho were not supposed to be readers.\nShe had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it\nand felt justified in telling me\nwhat to write in the sequel.'
p713
aS"\nNow, what if my roommate knew about my friend Fumi Onda,\na fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos,\nand is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?\nWhat if my roommate knew about the heart procedure\nthat was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?\nWhat if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,\ntalented people singing in English and Pidgin,\nand Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,\nmixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela\nto Bob Marley to their grandfathers.\nWhat if my roommate knew about the female lawyer\nwho recently went to court in Nigeria\nto challenge a ridiculous law\nthat required women to get their husband's consent\nbefore renewing their passports?\nWhat if my roommate knew about Nollywood,\nfull of innovative people making films despite great technical odds,\nfilms so popular\nthat they really are the best example\nof Nigerians consuming what they produce?\nWhat if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,\nwho has just started her own business selling hair extensions?\nOr about the millions of other Nigerians\nwho start businesses and sometimes fail,\nbut continue to nurse ambition?"
p714
aS'\nEvery time I am home I am confronted with\nthe usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians:\nour failed infrastructure, our failed government,\nbut also by the incredible resilience of people who\nthrive despite the government,\nrather than because of it.\nI teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer,\nand it is amazing to me how many people apply,\nhow many people are eager to write,\nto tell stories.'
p715
aS"\nMy Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit\ncalled Farafina Trust,\nand we have big dreams of building libraries\nand refurbishing libraries that already exist\nand providing books for state schools\nthat don't have anything in their libraries,\nand also of organizing lots and lots of workshops,\nin reading and writing,\nfor all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.\nStories matter.\nMany stories matter.\nStories have been used to dispossess and to malign,\nbut stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.\nStories can break the dignity of a people,\nbut stories can also repair that broken dignity."
p716
aS'\nThe American writer Alice Walker wrote this\nabout her Southern relatives\nwho had moved to the North.\nShe introduced them to a book about\nthe Southern life that they had left behind:\n"They sat around, reading the book themselves,\nlistening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."\nI would like to end with this thought:\nThat when we reject the single story,\nwhen we realize that there is never a single story\nabout any place,\nwe regain a kind of paradise.\nThank you.\n(Applause)'

S'\nIf I should have a daughter,\ninstead of "Mom,"\nshe\'s gonna call me "Point B,"\nbecause that way she knows that no matter what happens,\nat least she can always find her way to me.\nAnd I\'m going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands\nso she has to learn the entire universe\nbefore she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."\nAnd she\'s going to learn\nthat this life will hit you hard in the face,\nwait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.\nBut getting the wind knocked out of you\nis the only way to remind your lungs\nhow much they like the taste of air.\nThere is hurt, here,\nthat cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.\nSo the first time she realizes\nthat Wonder Woman isn\'t coming,\nI\'ll make sure she knows\nshe doesn\'t have to wear the cape all by herself\nbecause no matter how wide you stretch your fingers,\nyour hands will always be too small\nto catch all the pain you want to heal.\nBelieve me, I\'ve tried.\n"And, baby," I\'ll tell her,\ndon\'t keep your nose up in the air like that.\nI know that trick; I\'ve done it a million times.\nYou\'re just smelling for smoke\nso you can follow the trail back to a burning house,\nso you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire\nto see if you can save him.\nOr else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place,\nto see if you can change him."\nBut I know she will anyway,\nso instead I\'ll always keep an extra supply\nof chocolate and rain boots nearby,\nbecause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can\'t fix.\nOkay, there\'s a few heartbreaks that chocolate can\'t fix.\nBut that\'s what the rain boots are for,\nbecause rain will wash away everything, if you let it.\nI want her to look at the world\nthrough the underside of a glass-bottom boat,\nto look through a microscope\nat the galaxies that exist\non the pinpoint of a human mind,\nbecause that\'s the way my mom taught me.\nThat there\'ll be days like this.\n There\'ll be days like this, my momma said. \nWhen you open your hands to catch\nand wind up with only blisters and bruises;\nwhen you step out of the phone booth and try to fly\nand the very people you want to save\nare the ones standing on your cape;\nwhen your boots will fill with rain,\nand you\'ll be up to your knees in disappointment.\nAnd those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.\nBecause there\'s nothing more beautiful\nthan the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline,\nno matter how many times it\'s sent away.\nYou will put the wind in winsome, lose some.\nYou will put the star\nin starting over, and over.\nAnd no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute,\nbe sure your mind lands\non the beauty of this funny place called life.\nAnd yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting,\nI am pretty damn naive.\nBut I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.\nIt can crumble so easily,\nbut don\'t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.\n"Baby," I\'ll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier,\nand your poppa is a warrior,\nand you are the girl with small hands and big eyes\nwho never stops asking for more."\nRemember that good things come in threes\nand so do bad things.\nAnd always apologize when you\'ve done something wrong,\nbut don\'t you ever apologize\nfor the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.\nYour voice is small, but don\'t ever stop singing.\nAnd when they finally hand you heartache,\nwhen they slip war and hatred under your door\nand offer you handouts on street-corners\nof cynicism and defeat,\nyou tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.'

aS"\nAll right, so I want you to take a moment,\nand I want you to think of three things\nthat you know to be true.\nThey can be about whatever you want --\ntechnology, entertainment, design,\nyour family, what you had for breakfast.\nThe only rule is don't think too hard.\nOkay, ready? Go.\nOkay."
p728
aS'\nSo here are three things I know to be true.\nI know that Jean-Luc Godard was right\nwhen he said that, "a good story\nhas a beginning, a middle and an end,\nalthough not necessarily in that order."\nI know that I\'m incredibly nervous and excited to be up here,\nwhich is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I know\nthat I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.\n(Laughter)\nWhy was the scarecrow invited to TED?\nBecause he was out standing in his field.\n(Laughter)\nI\'m sorry.\nOkay, so these are three things I know to be true.\nBut there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.\nSo I write poems to figure things out.\nSometimes the only way I know how to work through something\nis by writing a poem.\nAnd sometimes I get to the end of the poem\nand look back and go, "Oh, that\'s what this is all about,"\nand sometimes I get to the end of the poem\nand haven\'t solved anything,\nbut at least I have a new poem out of it.'
p729
aS'\nSpoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry.\nI tell people it involves creating poetry\nthat doesn\'t just want to sit on paper,\nthat something about it demands it be heard out loud\nor witnessed in person.\nWhen I was a freshman in high school,\nI was a live wire of nervous hormones.\nAnd I was underdeveloped\nand over-excitable.\nAnd despite my fear\nof ever being looked at for too long,\nI was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry.\nI felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theatre,\nhad come together, had a baby,\na baby I needed to get to know.\nSo I decided to give it a try.\nMy first spoken word poem,\npacked with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old,\nwas about the injustice\nof being seen as unfeminine.\nThe poem was very indignant,\nand mainly exaggerated,\nbut the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point\nwas mainly indignant,\nso I thought that that\'s what was expected of me.\nThe first time that I performed,\nthe audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy,\nand when I came off the stage I was shaking.\nI felt this tap on my shoulder,\nand I turned around to see\nthis giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.\nShe was maybe eight feet tall\nand looked like she could beat me up with one hand,\nbut instead she just nodded at me\nand said, "Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."\nAnd lightning struck.\nI was hooked.'
p730
aS'\nI discovered this bar on Manhattan\'s Lower East Side\nthat hosted a weekly poetry open mic,\nand my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me\nto soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.\nI was the youngest by at least a decade,\nbut somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club\ndidn\'t seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about --\nif fact, they welcomed me.\nAnd it was here, listening to these poets share their stories,\nthat I learned that spoken word poetry didn\'t have to be indignant,\nit could be fun or painful\nor serious or silly.\nThe Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home,\nand the poets who performed\nencouraged me to share my stories as well.\nNever mind the fact that I was 14 --\nthey told me, "Write about being 14."\nSo I did and stood amazed every week\nwhen these brilliant, grown-up poets\nlaughed with me and groaned their sympathy\nand clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too."'
p731
aS'\nNow I can divide my spoken word journey\ninto three steps.\nStep one was the moment I said,\n"I can. I can do this."\nAnd that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.\nStep two was the moment I said,\n"I will. I will continue.\nI love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week."\nAnd step three began\nwhen I realized that I didn\'t have to write poems that were indignant,\nif that\'s not what I was.\nThere were things that were specific to me,\nand the more that I focused on those things,\nthe weirder my poetry got,\nbut the more that it felt like mine.\nIt\'s not just the adage "write what you know."\nIt\'s about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience\nyou\'ve collected up to now\nto help you dive into the things you don\'t know.\nI use poetry to help me work through what I don\'t understand,\nbut I show up to each new poem\nwith a backpack full\nof everywhere else that I\'ve been.'
p732
aS'\nWhen I got to university, I met a fellow poet\nwho shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry.\nAnd actually, Phil Kaye and I\ncoincidentally also share the same last name.\nWhen I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.\nas a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.\nBut Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E. --\nthis time changing the mission\nto using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain,\neducate and inspire.\nWe stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled,\nperforming and teaching\nnine-year-olds to MFA candidates,\nfrom California to Indiana to India\nto a public high school just up the street from campus.'
p733
aS'\nAnd we saw over and over\nthe way that spoken word poetry\ncracks open locks.\nBut it turns out sometimes,\npoetry can be really scary.\nTurns out sometimes,\nyou have to trick teenagers into writing poetry.\nSo I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists.\nAnd the first list that I assign\nis "10 Things I Know to be True."\nAnd here\'s what happens, and here\'s what you would discover too\nif we all started sharing our lists out loud.\nAt a certain point, you would realize\nthat someone has the exact same thing,\nor one thing very similar,\nto something on your list.\nAnd then someone else\nhas something the complete opposite of yours.\nThird, someone has something you\'ve never even heard of before.\nAnd fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about,\nbut they\'re introducing a new angle of looking at it.\nAnd I tell people that this is where great stories start from --\nthese four intersections\nof what you\'re passionate about\nand what others might be invested in.'
p734
aS'\nAnd most people respond really well to this exercise.\nBut one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte,\nwas not convinced.\nCharlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems.\n"Miss," she\'d say, "I\'m just not interesting.\nI don\'t have anything interesting to say."\nSo I assigned her list after list,\nand one day I assigned the list\n"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."\nNumber three on Charlotte\'s list was,\n"I should have learned not to crush on guys\nthree times my age."\nI asked her what that meant,\nand she said, "Miss, it\'s kind of a long story."\nAnd I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me."\nAnd so she wrote her first poem,\na love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.\nAnd the poem began,\n"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."\n(Laughter)\n"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,\nracing Michael Phelps in a pool --\nnothing but swim trunks on --\ndiving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?\nAfter the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair\nand said, \'You\'re a god.\'\nNo, Anderson, you\'re the god."'
p735
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p736
aS'\n(Applause)'
p737
aS"\nNow I know that the number one rule to being cool\nis to seem unfazed,\nto never admit that anything scares you\nor impresses you or excites you.\nSomebody once told me\nit's like walking through life like this.\nYou protect yourself\nfrom all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up.\nBut I try to walk through life like this.\nAnd yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt,\nbut it also means that when beautiful, amazing things\njust fall out of the sky,\nI'm ready to catch them.\nI use spoken word to help my students\nrediscover wonder,\nto fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed\nand, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them,\nso that they can reinterpret and create something from it."
p738
aS"\nIt's not that I think that spoken word poetry\nis the ideal art form.\nI'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.\nI write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.\nBut I teach spoken word poetry\nbecause it's accessible.\nNot everyone can read music\nor owns a camera,\nbut everyone can communicate in some way,\nand everyone has stories\nthat the rest of us can learn from.\nPlus, spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections.\nIt's not uncommon for people to feel like they're alone\nor that nobody understands them,\nbut spoken word teaches\nthat if you have the ability to express yourself\nand the courage to present those stories and opinions,\nyou could be rewarded\nwith a room full of your peers,\nor your community, who will listen.\nAnd maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie\nwill connect with what you've shared.\nAnd that is an amazing realization to have,\nespecially when you're 14.\nPlus, now with YouTube,\nthat connection's not even limited to the room we're in.\nI'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances\nthat I can share with my students.\nIt allows for even more opportunities\nfor them to find a poet or a poem\nthat they connect to."
p739
aS"\nIt is tempting -- once you've figured this out --\nit is tempting to keep writing the same poem,\nor keep telling the same story, over and over,\nonce you've figured out that it will gain you applause.\nIt's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.\nYou have to grow and explore\nand take risks and challenge yourself.\nAnd that is step three:\ninfusing the work you're doing\nwith the specific things that make you you,\neven while those things are always changing.\nBecause step three never ends.\nBut you don't get to start on step three,\nuntil you take step one first: I can."
p740
aS"\nI travel a lot while I'm teaching,\nand I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three,\nbut I was very lucky with Charlotte,\nthat I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.\nI watched her realize\nthat, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing,\nshe can create poems that only Charlotte can write --\nabout eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.\nAnd I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell --\nlike this story.\nI spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story,\nand I wondered if the best way\nwas going to be a PowerPoint or a short film --\nand where exactly was the beginning or the middle or the end?\nAnd I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk\nand finally have figured it all out, or not."
p741
aS"\nAnd I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club,\nbut it's possible that it was much earlier.\nIn preparing for TED,\nI discovered this diary page in an old journal.\nI think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th.\nIt's clear that when I was a child,\nI definitely walked through life like this.\nI think that we all did.\nI would like to help others rediscover that wonder --\nto want to engage with it, to want to learn,\nto want to share what they've learned,\nwhat they've figured out to be true\nand what they're still figuring out."
p742
aS"\nSo I'd like to close with this poem."
p743
aS'\nWhen they bombed Hiroshima,\nthe explosion formed a mini-supernova\nso every living animal, human or plant\nthat received direct contact\nwith the rays from that sun\nwas instantly turned to ash.\nAnd what was left of the city soon followed.\nThe long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation\ncaused an entire city and its population\nto turn into powder.\nWhen I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room\nwith a stare that said, "This? I\'ve done this before."\nShe says I have old eyes.\nWhen my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old,\nbut I took my mom by the hand and told her,\n"Don\'t worry, he\'ll come back as a baby."\nAnd yet, for someone who\'s apparently done this already,\nI still haven\'t figured anything out yet.\nMy knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.\nMy self-confidence can be measured out\nin teaspoons mixed into my poetry,\nand it still always tastes funny in my mouth.\nBut in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away,\nleaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.\nSo no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets,\nI keep trying,\nhoping that one day I\'ll write a poem\nI can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit\nas the only proof I existed.\nMy parents named me Sarah,\nwhich is a biblical name.\nIn the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible\nand she laughed,\nbecause the first Sarah,\nshe didn\'t know what to do with impossible.\nAnd me? Well, neither do I,\nbut I see the impossible every day.\nImpossible is trying to connect in this world,\ntrying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you,\nknowing that while you\'re speaking,\nthey aren\'t just waiting for their turn to talk -- they hear you.\nThey feel exactly what you feel\nat the same time that you feel it.\nIt\'s what I strive for every time I open my mouth --\nthat impossible connection.\nThere\'s this piece of wall in Hiroshima\nthat was completely burnt black by the radiation.\nBut on the front step, a person who was sitting there\nblocked the rays from hitting the stone.\nThe only thing left now\nis a permanent shadow of positive light.\nAfter the A-bomb,\nspecialists said it would take 75 years\nfor the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City\nto ever grow anything again.\nBut that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth.\nWhen I meet you, in that moment,\nI\'m no longer a part of your future.\nI start quickly becoming part of your past.\nBut in that instant, I get to share your present.\nAnd you, you get to share mine.\nAnd that is the greatest present of all.\nSo if you tell me I can do the impossible,\nI\'ll probably laugh at you.\nI don\'t know if I can change the world yet,\nbecause I don\'t know that much about it --\nand I don\'t know that much about reincarnation either,\nbut if you make me laugh hard enough,\nsometimes I forget what century I\'m in.\nThis isn\'t my first time here. This isn\'t my last time here.\nThese aren\'t the last words I\'ll share.\nBut just in case, I\'m trying my hardest\nto get it right this time around.'

S'\nI have a confession to make,\nbut first, I want you\nto make a little confession to me.\nIn the past year, I want you to just raise your hand'
p752
aS"\nif you've experienced relatively little stress.\nAnyone?"
p753
aS'\nHow about a moderate amount of stress?'
p754
aS'\nWho has experienced a lot of stress?\nYeah. Me too.'
p755
aS"\nBut that is not my confession.\nMy confession is this: I am a health psychologist,\nand my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.\nBut I fear that something I've been teaching\nfor the last 10 years is doing more harm than good,\nand it has to do with stress.\nFor years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.\nIt increases the risk of everything from the common cold\nto cardiovascular disease.\nBasically, I've turned stress into the enemy.\nBut I have changed my mind about stress,\nand today, I want to change yours."
p756
aS'\nLet me start with the study that made me rethink\nmy whole approach to stress.\nThis study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States\nfor eight years, and they started by asking people,\n"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"\nThey also asked, "Do you believe\nthat stress is harmful for your health?"\nAnd then they used public death records\nto find out who died.'
p757
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p758
aS'\nOkay. Some bad news first.\nPeople who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year\nhad a 43 percent increased risk of dying.\nBut that was only true for the people\nwho also believed that stress is harmful for your health.\n(Laughter)\nPeople who experienced a lot of stress\nbut did not view stress as harmful\nwere no more likely to die.\nIn fact, they had the lowest risk of dying\nof anyone in the study, including people\nwho had relatively little stress.'
p759
aS'\nNow the researchers estimated that over the eight years\nthey were tracking deaths,\n182,000 Americans died prematurely,\nnot from stress, but from the belief\nthat stress is bad for you. (Laughter)\nThat is over 20,000 deaths a year.\nNow, if that estimate is correct,\nthat would make believing stress is bad for you\nthe 15th largest cause of death\nin the United States last year,\nkilling more people than skin cancer,\nHIV/AIDS and homicide.'
p760
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p761
aS"\nYou can see why this study freaked me out.\nHere I've been spending so much energy telling people\nstress is bad for your health."
p762
aS"\nSo this study got me wondering:\nCan changing how you think about stress\nmake you healthier? And here the science says yes.\nWhen you change your mind about stress,\nyou can change your body's response to stress."
p763
aS"\nNow to explain how this works,\nI want you all to pretend that you are participants\nin a study designed to stress you out.\nIt's called the social stress test.\nYou come into the laboratory,\nand you're told you have to give a five-minute\nimpromptu speech on your personal weaknesses\nto a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,\nand to make sure you feel the pressure,\nthere are bright lights and a camera in your face,\nkind of like this.\nAnd the evaluators have been trained\nto give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback like this."
p764
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p765
aS"\nNow that you're sufficiently demoralized,\ntime for part two: a math test.\nAnd unbeknownst to you,\nthe experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.\nNow we're going to all do this together.\nIt's going to be fun.\nFor me."
p766
aS"\nOkay. I want you all to count backwards\nfrom 996 in increments of seven.\nYou're going to do this out loud\nas fast as you can, starting with 996.\nGo!\nAudience: (Counting)\nGo faster. Faster please.\nYou're going too slow.\nStop. Stop, stop, stop.\nThat guy made a mistake.\nWe are going to have to start all over again. (Laughter)\nYou're not very good at this, are you?\nOkay, so you get the idea.\nNow, if you were actually in this study,\nyou'd probably be a little stressed out.\nYour heart might be pounding,\nyou might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.\nAnd normally, we interpret these physical changes\nas anxiety\nor signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure."
p767
aS"\nBut what if you viewed them instead\nas signs that your body was energized,\nwas preparing you to meet this challenge?\nNow that is exactly what participants were told\nin a study conducted at Harvard University.\nBefore they went through the social stress test,\nthey were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.\nThat pounding heart is preparing you for action.\nIf you're breathing faster, it's no problem.\nIt's getting more oxygen to your brain.\nAnd participants who learned to view the stress response\nas helpful for their performance,\nwell, they were less stressed out,\nless anxious, more confident,\nbut the most fascinating finding to me\nwas how their physical stress response changed.\nNow, in a typical stress response,\nyour heart rate goes up,\nand your blood vessels constrict like this.\nAnd this is one of the reasons that chronic stress\nis sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.\nIt's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.\nBut in the study, when participants viewed\ntheir stress response as helpful,\ntheir blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.\nTheir heart was still pounding,\nbut this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.\nIt actually looks a lot like what happens\nin moments of joy and courage.\nOver a lifetime of stressful experiences,\nthis one biological change\ncould be the difference\nbetween a stress-induced heart attack at age 50\nand living well into your 90s.\nAnd this is really what the new science of stress reveals,\nthat how you think about stress matters."
p768
aS"\nSo my goal as a health psychologist has changed.\nI no longer want to get rid of your stress.\nI want to make you better at stress.\nAnd we just did a little intervention.\nIf you raised your hand and said\nyou'd had a lot of stress in the last year,\nwe could have saved your life,\nbecause hopefully the next time\nyour heart is pounding from stress,\nyou're going to remember this talk\nand you're going to think to yourself,\nthis is my body helping me rise to this challenge.\nAnd when you view stress in that way,\nyour body believes you,\nand your stress response becomes healthier."
p769
aS'\nNow I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress\nto redeem myself from,\nso we are going to do one more intervention.\nI want to tell you about one of the most\nunder-appreciated aspects of the stress response,\nand the idea is this:\nStress makes you social.'
p770
aS"\nTo understand this side of stress,\nwe need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,\nand I know oxytocin has already gotten\nas much hype as a hormone can get.\nIt even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,\nbecause it's released when you hug someone.\nBut this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.\nOxytocin is a neuro-hormone.\nIt fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.\nIt primes you to do things\nthat strengthen close relationships.\nOxytocin makes you crave physical contact\nwith your friends and family.\nIt enhances your empathy.\nIt even makes you more willing to help and support\nthe people you care about.\nSome people have even suggested\nwe should snort oxytocin\nto become more compassionate and caring.\nBut here's what most people don't understand\nabout oxytocin.\nIt's a stress hormone.\nYour pituitary gland pumps this stuff out\nas part of the stress response.\nIt's as much a part of your stress response\nas the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.\nAnd when oxytocin is released in the stress response,\nit is motivating you to seek support.\nYour biological stress response\nis nudging you to tell someone how you feel\ninstead of bottling it up.\nYour stress response wants to make sure you notice\nwhen someone else in your life is struggling\nso that you can support each other.\nWhen life is difficult, your stress response wants you\nto be surrounded by people who care about you."
p771
aS"\nOkay, so how is knowing this side of stress\ngoing to make you healthier?\nWell, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.\nIt also acts on your body,\nand one of its main roles in your body\nis to protect your cardiovascular system\nfrom the effects of stress.\nIt's a natural anti-inflammatory.\nIt also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.\nBut my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.\nYour heart has receptors for this hormone,\nand oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate\nand heal from any stress-induced damage.\nThis stress hormone strengthens your heart,\nand the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits\nof oxytocin are enhanced by social contact\nand social support,\nso when you reach out to others under stress,\neither to seek support or to help someone else,\nyou release more of this hormone,\nyour stress response becomes healthier,\nand you actually recover faster from stress.\nI find this amazing,\nthat your stress response has a built-in mechanism\nfor stress resilience,\nand that mechanism is human connection."
p772
aS'\nI want to finish by telling you about one more study.\nAnd listen up, because this study could also save a life.\nThis study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States,\nand they ranged in age from 34 to 93,\nand they started the study by asking,\n"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"\nThey also asked, "How much time have you spent\nhelping out friends, neighbors,\npeople in your community?"\nAnd then they used public records for the next five years\nto find out who died.'
p773
aS"\nOkay, so the bad news first:\nFor every major stressful life experience,\nlike financial difficulties or family crisis,\nthat increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.\nBut -- and I hope you are expecting a but by now --\nbut that wasn't true for everyone.\nPeople who spent time caring for others\nshowed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. Zero.\nCaring created resilience.\nAnd so we see once again\nthat the harmful effects of stress on your health\nare not inevitable.\nHow you think and how you act\ncan transform your experience of stress.\nWhen you choose to view your stress response\nas helpful,\nyou create the biology of courage.\nAnd when you choose to connect with others under stress,\nyou can create resilience.\nNow I wouldn't necessarily ask\nfor more stressful experiences in my life,\nbut this science has given me\na whole new appreciation for stress.\nStress gives us access to our hearts.\nThe compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning\nin connecting with others,\nand yes, your pounding physical heart,\nworking so hard to give you strength and energy,\nand when you choose to view stress in this way,\nyou're not just getting better at stress,\nyou're actually making a pretty profound statement.\nYou're saying that you can trust yourself\nto handle life's challenges,\nand you're remembering that\nyou don't have to face them alone."
p774
aS'\nThank you.'

aS"\nChris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.\nIt seems amazing to me that a belief about stress\ncan make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.\nHow would that extend to advice,\nlike, if someone is making a lifestyle choice\nbetween, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job,\ndoes it matter which way they go?\nIt's equally wise to go for the stressful job\nso long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?"
p777
aS"\nKelly McGonigal: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain\nis that chasing meaning is better for your health\nthan trying to avoid discomfort.\nAnd so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,\nis go after what it is that creates meaning in your life\nand then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows."

S'\nI\'m going to talk to you about some stuff that\'s in this book of mine\nthat I hope will resonate with other things you\'ve already heard,\nand I\'ll try to make some connections myself, in case you miss them.\nI want to start with what I call the "official dogma."\nThe official dogma of what?\nThe official dogma of all western industrial societies.\nAnd the official dogma runs like this:\nif we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens,\nthe way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.\nThe reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good,\nvaluable, worthwhile, essential to being human.\nAnd because if people have freedom,\nthen each of us can act on our own\nto do the things that will maximize our welfare,\nand no one has to decide on our behalf.\nThe way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.'
p782
aS'\nThe more choice people have, the more freedom they have,\nand the more freedom they have,\nthe more welfare they have.'
p783
aS"\nThis, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply\nthat it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.\nAnd it's also deeply embedded in our lives.\nI'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.\nThis is my supermarket. Not such a big one.\nI want to say just a word about salad dressing.\n175 salad dressings in my supermarket,\nif you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils\nand 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy\nto make a very large number of your own salad dressings,\nin the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.\nSo this is what the supermarket is like.\nAnd then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system --\nspeakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier --\nand in this one single consumer electronics store,\nthere are that many stereo systems.\nWe can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems\nout of the components that are on offer in one store."
p784
aS'\nYou\'ve got to admit that\'s a lot of choice.\nIn other domains -- the world of communications.\nThere was a time, when I was a boy,\nwhen you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,\nas long as it came from Ma Bell.\nYou rented your phone. You didn\'t buy it.\nOne consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.\nAnd those days are gone.\nWe now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,\nespecially in the world of cell phones.\nThese are cell phones of the future.\nMy favorite is the middle one --\nthe MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and creme brulee torch.\nAnd if by some chance you haven\'t seen that in your store yet,\nyou can rest assured that one day soon you will.\nAnd what this does is\nit leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.\nAnd do you know what the answer to this question now is?\nThe answer is "No."\nIt is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn\'t do too much.'
p785
aS'\nSo, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things,\nthe same explosion of choice is true.\nHealth care -- it is no longer the case in the United States\nthat you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.\nInstead, you go to the doctor,\nand the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.\nA has these benefits, and these risks.\nB has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?"\nAnd you say, "Doc, what should I do?"\nAnd the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks.\nWhat do you want to do?"\nAnd you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"\nAnd the doc says, "But I\'m not you."\nAnd the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy,"\nwhich makes it sound like a good thing,\nbut what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility\nfor decision-making from somebody who knows something --\nnamely, the doctor --\nto somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick\nand thus not in the best shape to be making decisions --\nnamely, the patient.'
p786
aS"\nThere's enormous marketing of prescription drugs\nto people like you and me,\nwhich, if you think about it, makes no sense at all,\nsince we can't buy them.\nWhy do they market to us if we can't buy them?\nThe answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning\nand ask for our prescriptions to be changed.\nSomething as dramatic as our identity\nhas now become a matter of choice,\nas this slide is meant to indicate.\nWe don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.\nAnd we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.\nAnd that means that everyday, when you wake up in the morning,\nyou have to decide what kind of person you want to be.\nWith respect to marriage and family,\nthere was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had\nis that you got married as soon as you could,\nand then you started having kids as soon as you could.\nThe only real choice was who,\nnot when, and not what you did after."
p787
aS'\nNowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.\nI teach wonderfully intelligent students,\nand I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.\nAnd it\'s not because they\'re less smart,\nand it\'s not because they\'re less diligent.\nIt\'s because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,\n"Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?\nShould I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?"\nAll of these are consuming questions.\nAnd they\'re going to answer these questions,\nwhether or not it means not doing all the work I assign\nand not getting a good grade in my courses.\nAnd indeed they should. These are important questions to answer.\nWork -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,\nwith the technology that enables us\nto work every minute of every day from any place on the planet --\nexcept the Randolph Hotel.'
p788
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p789
aS'\nThere is one corner, by the way,\nthat I\'m not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi works.\nI\'m not telling you about it because I want to use it.\nSo what this means, this incredible freedom of choice\nwe have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision,\nagain and again and again,\nabout whether we should or shouldn\'t be working.\nWe can go to watch our kid play soccer,\nand we have our cell phone on one hip,\nand our Blackberry on our other hip,\nand our laptop, presumably, on our laps.\nAnd even if they\'re all shut off,\nevery minute that we\'re watching our kid mutilate a soccer game,\nwe are also asking ourselves,\n"Should I answer this cell phone call?\nShould I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?"\nAnd even if the answer to the question is "no,"\nit\'s certainly going to make the experience of your kid\'s soccer game\nvery different than it would\'ve been.\nSo everywhere we look,\nbig things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,\nlife is a matter of choice.\nAnd the world we used to live in looked like this.\nThat is to say, there were some choices,\nbut not everything was a matter of choice.\nAnd the world we now live in looks like this.\nAnd the question is, is this good news, or bad news?\nAnd the answer is yes.'
p790
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p791
aS"\nWe all know what's good about it,\nso I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.\nAll of this choice has two effects,\ntwo negative effects on people.\nOne effect, paradoxically,\nis that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.\nWith so many options to choose from,\npeople find it very difficult to choose at all.\nI'll give you one very dramatic example of this:\na study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.\nA colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,\nthe gigantic mutual fund company\nof about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.\nAnd what she found is that\nfor every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,\nrate of participation went down two percent.\nYou offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate\nthan if you only offer five. Why?\nBecause with 50 funds to choose from,\nit's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose\nthat you'll just put it off until tomorrow.\nAnd then tomorrow, and then tomorrow,\nand tomorrow, and tomorrow,\nand of course tomorrow never comes.\nUnderstand that not only does this mean\nthat people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire\nbecause they don't have enough money put away,\nit also means that making the decision is so hard\nthat they pass up significant matching money from the employer.\nBy not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year\nfrom the employer, who would happily match their contribution.\nSo paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.\nAnd I think it makes the world look like this."
p792
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p793
aS"\nYou really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?\nYou don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or even the wrong salad dressing.\nSo that's one effect. The second effect is that\neven if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice,\nwe end up less satisfied with the result of the choice\nthan we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.\nAnd there are several reasons for this.\nOne of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,\nif you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what salad dressing is? --\nit's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice\nthat would have been better. And what happens is\nthis imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,\nand this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made,\neven if it was a good decision.\nThe more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all\nthat is disappointing about the option that you chose."
p794
aS'\nSecond, what economists call "opportunity costs."\nDan Gilbert made a big point this morning\nof talking about how much the way in which we value things\ndepends on what we compare them to.\nWell, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,\nit is easy to imagine the attractive features\nof alternatives that you reject,\nthat make you less satisfied with the alternative that you\'ve chosen.\nHere\'s an example. For those of you who aren\'t New Yorkers, I apologize.'
p795
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p796
aS'\nBut here\'s what you\'re supposed to be thinking.\nHere\'s this couple on the Hamptons.\nVery expensive real estate.\nGorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.\nWhat could be better? "Well, damn it,"\nthis guy is thinking, "It\'s August.\nEverybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.\nI could be parking right in front of my building."\nAnd he spends two weeks nagged by the idea\nthat he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.\nOpportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose,\neven when what we choose is terrific.\nAnd the more options there are to consider,\nthe more attractive features of these options\nare going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.\nHere\'s another example.\nNow this cartoon makes a lot of points.\nIt makes points about living in the moment as well,\nand probably about doing things slowly.\nBut one point it makes is that whenever you\'re choosing one thing,\nyou\'re choosing not to do other things.\nAnd those other things may have lots of attractive features,\nand it\'s going to make what you\'re doing less attractive.'
p797
aS'\nThird: escalation of expectations.\nThis hit me when I went to replace my jeans.\nI wear jeans almost all the time.\nAnd there was a time when jeans came in one flavor,\nand you bought them, and they fit like crap,\nand they were incredibly uncomfortable,\nand if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times,\nthey started to feel OK.\nSo I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones,\nand I said, you know, "I want a pair of jeans. Here\'s my size."\nAnd the shopkeeper said,\n"Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?\nYou want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?\nDo you want them distressed?\nYou want boot cut, you want tapered, blah blah blah ..." On and on he went.\nMy jaw dropped, and after I recovered, I said,\n"I want the kind that used to be the only kind."'
p798
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p799
aS"\nHe had no idea what that was,\nso I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans,\nand I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.\nI did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better.\nBut I felt worse.\nWhy? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. (Laughter)\nThe reason I felt worse is that,\nwith all of these options available,\nmy expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.\nI had very low --\nI had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.\nWhen they came in 100 flavors, damn it,\none of them should've been perfect.\nAnd what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.\nAnd so I compared what I got to what I expected,\nand what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.\nAdding options to people's lives\ncan't help but increase the expectations people have\nabout how good those options will be.\nAnd what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results,\neven when they're good results.\nNobody in the world of marketing knows this,\nbecause if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.\nThe truth is more like this."
p800
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p801
aS'\nThe reason that everything was better back when everything was worse\nis that when everything was worse,\nit was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.\nNowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens,\nwith perfection the expectation --\nthe best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.\nYou will never be pleasantly surprised\nbecause your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof.\nThe secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for --\nthe secret to happiness is low expectations.'
p802
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p803
aS'\n(Applause)'
p804
aS"\nI want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment --\nthat I actually am married to a wife,\nand she's really quite wonderful.\nI couldn't have done better. I didn't settle.\nBut settling isn't always such a bad thing.\nFinally, one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans\nwhen there is only one kind to buy\nis that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why,\nwho's responsible, the answer is clear:\nthe world is responsible. What could you do?\nWhen there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available,\nand you buy one that is disappointing,\nand you ask why, who's responsible?\nIt is equally clear that the answer to the question is you.\nYou could have done better.\nWith a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,\nthere is no excuse for failure.\nAnd so when people make decisions,\nand even though the results of the decisions are good,\nthey feel disappointed about them;\nthey blame themselves."
p805
aS"\nClinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.\nI believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor\nto this explosion of depression, and also suicide,\nis that people have experiences that are disappointing\nbecause their standards are so high,\nand then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,\nthey think they're at fault.\nAnd so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively,\nand we feel worse.\nSo let me remind you.\nThis is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,\nand it's all false. It is not true.\nThere's no question that some choice is better than none,\nbut it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.\nThere's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.\nI'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point\nwhere options improve our welfare."
p806
aS"\nNow, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done --\nas a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:\nwhat enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence.\nThere are lots of places in the world,\nand we have heard about several of them,\nwhere their problem is not that they have too much choice.\nTheir problem is that they have too little.\nSo the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem\nof modern, affluent, Western societies.\nAnd what is so frustrating and infuriating is this:\nSteve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how\nthese expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money.\nWhat I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices --\nit's not simply that they don't help.\nThey actually hurt.\nThey actually make us worse off."
p807
aS'\nIf some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make\nwere shifted to societies in which people have too few options,\nnot only would those people\'s lives be improved,\nbut ours would be improved also.\nThis is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."\nIncome redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people --\nbecause of how all this excess choice plagues us.\nSo to conclude. You\'re supposed to read this cartoon,\nand, being a sophisticated person, say,\n"Ah! What does this fish know?\nYou know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl."\nImpoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world --\nand that\'s the way I read it at first.\nThe more I thought about it, however,\nthe more I came to the view that this fish knows something.\nBecause the truth of the matter is that\nif you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible,\nyou don\'t have freedom. You have paralysis.\nIf you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible,\nyou decrease satisfaction.\nYou increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.\nEverybody needs a fishbowl.\nThis one is almost certainly too limited --\nperhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.\nBut the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery,\nand, I suspect, disaster.\nThank you very much.'

S'\nThis is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students,\ncut down to three minutes.\nAnd it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED,\nseven years ago.\nAnd in the seat next to me\nwas a high school student, a teenager,\nand she came from a really poor family.\nAnd she wanted to make something of her life,\nand she asked me a simple little question.\nShe said, "What leads to success?"\nAnd I felt really badly,\nbecause I couldn\'t give her a good answer.\nSo I get off the plane, and I come to TED.\nAnd I think, jeez, I\'m in the middle of a room of successful people!\nSo why don\'t I ask them what helped them succeed,\nand pass it on to kids?'
p811
aS'\nSo here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later,\nand I\'m gonna tell you what really leads to success\nand makes TEDsters tick.\nAnd the first thing is passion.\nFreeman Thomas says, "I\'m driven by my passion."\nTEDsters do it for love; they don\'t do it for money.'
p812
aS'\nCarol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."\nAnd the interesting thing is:\nif you do it for love, the money comes anyway.'
p813
aS'\nWork! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It\'s all hard work.\nNothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."\nDid he say fun? Rupert? Yes!'
p814
aS"\nTEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.\nI figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics."
p815
aS'\nGood! Alex Garden says, "To be successful put your nose down in something\nand get damn good at it."\nThere\'s no magic; it\'s practice, practice, practice.'
p816
aS'\nAnd it\'s focus. Norman Jewison said to me,\n"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."'
p817
aS'\nAnd push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself.\nPhysically, mentally, you\'ve gotta push, push, push."\nYou gotta push through shyness and self-doubt.'
p818
aS'\nGoldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.\nI wasn\'t good enough; I wasn\'t smart enough.\nI didn\'t think I\'d make it."'
p819
aS'\nNow it\'s not always easy to push yourself,\nand that\'s why they invented mothers. (Laughter)\nFrank Gehry -- Frank Gehry said to me,\n"My mother pushed me."'
p820
aS'\nServe! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."'
p821
aS'\nNow a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires.\nAnd the first thing I say to them is:\n"OK, well you can\'t serve yourself;\nyou gotta serve others something of value.\nBecause that\'s the way people really get rich."'
p822
aS'\nIdeas! TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:\nfounding the first micro-computer software company."\nI\'d say it was a pretty good idea.\nAnd there\'s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas --\nit\'s just doing some very simple things.\nAnd I give lots of evidence.'
p823
aS'\nPersist! Joe Kraus says,\n"Persistence is the number one reason for our success."\nYou gotta persist through failure. You gotta persist through crap!\nWhich of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."\n(Laughter)'
p824
aS'\nSo, the big -- the answer to this question is simple:\nPay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.\nOr failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me,\nthese are the big eight things that lead to success.\nThank you TEDsters for all your interviews!'

S"\nDo you think it's possible to control someone's attention?\nEven more than that,\nwhat about predicting human behavior?\nI think those are interesting ideas, if you could.\nI mean, for me, that would be the perfect superpower,\nactually kind of an evil way of approaching it.\nBut for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years\nstudying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way:\npicking pockets.\nWhen we think of misdirection,\nwe think of something as looking off to the side,\nwhen actually it's often the things that are right in front of us\nthat are the hardest things to see,\nthe things that you look at every day that you're blinded to."
p827
aS"\nFor example, how many of you still have your cell phones\non you right now?\nGreat. Double-check.\nMake sure you still have them on you.\nI was doing some shopping beforehand.\nNow you've looked at them probably a few times today,\nbut I'm going to ask you a question about them.\nWithout looking at your cell phone directly yet,\ncan you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?\nBring them out, check, and see how accurate you were.\nHow'd you do? Show of hands. Did we get it?"
p828
aS"\nNow that you're done looking at those, close them down,\nbecause every phone has something in common.\nNo matter how you organize the icons,\nyou still have a clock on the front.\nSo, without looking at your phone, what time was it?\nYou just looked at your clock, right?\nIt's an interesting idea. Now, I'll ask you to take that a step further with a game of trust.\nClose your eyes.\nI realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard\nthere's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes."
p829
aS"\nNow, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.\nWith your eyes closed, what am I wearing?\nMake your best guess.\nWhat color is my shirt? What color is my tie?\nNow open your eyes.\nBy a show of hands, were you right?"
p830
aS"\nIt's interesting, isn't it? Some of us are a little bit\nmore perceptive than others. It seems that way.\nBut I have a different theory about that, that model of attention.\nThey have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.\nFor me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.\nIt's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors,\nand inside your brain is a little security guard.\nFor me, I like to call him Frank.\nSo Frank is sitting at a desk.\nHe's got all sorts of cool information in front of him,\nhigh-tech equipment, he's got cameras,\nhe's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears,\nall these senses, all these perceptions.\nBut attention is what steers your perceptions,\nis what controls your reality. It's the gateway to the mind.\nIf you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.\nBut ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.\nThat's why there's the cocktail effect:\nWhen you're in a party, you're having conversations with someone,\nand yet you can recognize your name\nand you didn't even realize you were listening to that."
p831
aS"\nNow, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this,\nto play with your attention as a limited resource.\nSo if I could control how you spend your attention,\nif I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.\nNow, instead of doing it like misdirection\nand throwing it off to the side,\ninstead, what I choose to focus on is Frank,\nto be able to play with the Frank inside your head,\nyour little security guard,\nand get you, instead of focusing on your external senses,\njust to go internal for a second.\nSo if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?\nWhat just happened? Do you have a wallet?\nDo you have an American Express in your wallet?\nAnd when I do that, your Frank turns around.\nHe accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.\nAnd what's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape\nat the same time that he's trying to process new data."
p832
aS"\nNow, I mean, this sounds like a good theory,\nbut I could talk for a long time and tell you lots of things,\nand they may be true, a portion of them,\nbut I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.\nSo if I come down, I'm going to do a little bit of shopping.\nJust hold still where you are."
p833
aS"\nHello, how are you? It's lovely to see you.\nYou did a wonderful job onstage.\nYou have a lovely watch that doesn't come off very well.\nDo you have your ring as well?\nGood. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet.\nIt's hard to tell where to start, there's so many great things."

All right, let's try that.\nCan you stand right over this way for me?\nTurn around and, let's see,\nif I give you something that belongs to me,\nthis is just something I have, a poker chip.\nHold out your hand for me. Watch it kind of closely.\nNow this is a task for you to focus on.\nNow you have your money in your front pocket here?\nJoe: Yup.\nAR: Good. I'm not going to actually put my hand in your pocket.\nI'm not ready for that kind of commitment.\nOne time a guy had a hole in his pocket,\nand that was rather traumatizing for me.\nI was looking for his wallet and he gave me his phone number.\nIt was a big miscommunication."

Just use your hand.\nGrab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.\nDid you see it go?\nJoe: No.\nAR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.\nSee, while we're focused on the hand,\nit's sitting on your shoulder right now.\nGo ahead and take it off.\nNow, let's try that again.\nHold your hand out flat. Open it up all the way.\nPut your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close there, Joe.\nSee, if I did it slowly, it'd be back on your shoulder.\n(Laughter)\nJoe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.\nYou're going to get it eventually. I have faith in you.\nSqueeze firm. You're human, you're not slow.\nIt's back on your shoulder.\nYou were focused on your hand. That's why you were distracted.\nWhile you were watching this, I couldn't quite get your watch off. It was difficult.\nYet you had something inside your front pocket.\nDo you remember what it was?\nJoe: Money.\nAR: Check your pocket. See if it's still there. Is it still there? (Laughter)\nOh, that's where it was. Go ahead and put it away.\nWe're just shopping. This trick's more about the timing, really.\nI'm going to try to push it inside your hand.\nPut your other hand on top for me, would you?\nIt's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?\nIt looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?"
p842
aS'\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p843
aS"\nJoe: That's pretty good. That's pretty good.\nAR: Oh, thanks.\nBut it's only a start. Let's try it again, a little bit differently.\nHold your hands together. Put your other hand on top.\nNow if you're watching this little token,\nthis obviously has become a little target. It's like a red herring.\nIf we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.\nIt's not back on your shoulder.\nIt falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.\nDid you see it go?\nYeah, it's funny. We've got a little guy. He's union. He works up there all day.\nIf I did it slowly, if it goes straightaway,\nit lands down by your pocket. I believe is it in this pocket, sir?\nNo, don't reach in your pocket. That's a different show.\nSo -- (Squeaking noise) -- that's rather strange. They have shots for that.\nCan I show them what that is? That's rather bizarre. Is this yours, sir?\nI have no idea how that works. We'll just send that over there."
p844
aS"\nThat's great. I need help with this one.\nStep over this way for me.\nNow don't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket.\nI was checking mine. I couldn't find everything,\nbut I noticed you had something here.\nCan I feel the outside of your pocket for a moment?\nDown here I noticed this. Is this something of yours, sir?\nIs this? I have no idea. That's a shrimp."
p845
aS"\nJoe: Yeah. I'm saving it for later."
p846
aS"\nAR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way,\nbetter than you know.\nSo we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift. (Laughter)\nHopefully it matches his taste.\nBut also, we have a couple of other things,\na little bit of cash, and then we have a few other things.\nThese all belong to you,\nalong with a big round of applause from all your friends. (Applause)"
p847
aS'\nJoe, thank you very much.'

p852
aS"\nAttention is a powerful thing.\nLike I said, it shapes your reality.\nSo, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.\nIf you could control somebody's attention,\nwhat would you do with it?"

aa(lp856
S'\nWhen I was in my 20s,\nI saw my very first psychotherapy client.\nI was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.\nShe was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.\nNow Alex walked into her first session\nwearing jeans and a big slouchy top,\nand she dropped onto the couch in my office\nand kicked off her flats\nand told me she was there to talk about guy problems.\nNow when I heard this, I was so relieved.\nMy classmate got an arsonist for her first client.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.\nThis I thought I could handle.'
p857
aS'\nBut I didn\'t handle it.\nWith the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,\nit was easy for me just to nod my head\nwhile we kicked the can down the road.\n"Thirty\'s the new 20," Alex would say,\nand as far as I could tell, she was right.\nWork happened later, marriage happened later,\nkids happened later, even death happened later.\nTwentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.'
p858
aS'\nBut before long, my supervisor pushed me\nto push Alex about her love life.\nI pushed back.'
p859
aS'\nI said, "Sure, she\'s dating down,\nshe\'s sleeping with a knucklehead,\nbut it\'s not like she\'s going to marry the guy."'
p860
aS'\nAnd then my supervisor said,\n"Not yet, but she might marry the next one.\nBesides, the best time to work on Alex\'s marriage\nis before she has one."'
p861
aS'\nThat\'s what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.\nThat was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.\nYes, people settle down later than they used to,\nbut that didn\'t make Alex\'s 20s a developmental downtime.\nThat made Alex\'s 20s a developmental sweet spot,\nand we were sitting there blowing it.\nThat was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect\nwas a real problem, and it had real consequences,\nnot just for Alex and her love life\nbut for the careers and the families and the futures\nof twentysomethings everywhere.'
p862
aS"\nThere are 50 million twentysomethings\nin the United States right now.\nWe're talking about 15 percent of the population,\nor 100 percent if you consider\nthat no one's getting through adulthood\nwithout going through their 20s first."
p863
aS"\nRaise your hand if you're in your 20s.\nI really want to see some twentysomethings here.\nOh, yay! Y'all's awesome.\nIf you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,\nyou're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see \nOkay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter."
p864
aS'\nSo I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe\nthat every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings\ndeserves to know what psychologists,\nsociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists\nalready know:\nthat claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,\nyet most transformative, things you can do\nfor work, for love, for your happiness,\nmaybe even for the world.'
p865
aS'\nThis is not my opinion. These are the facts.\nWe know that 80 percent of life\'s most defining moments\ntake place by age 35.\nThat means that eight out of 10 of the decisions\nand experiences and "Aha!" moments\nthat make your life what it is\nwill have happened by your mid-30s.\nPeople who are over 40, don\'t panic.\nThis crowd is going to be fine, I think.\nWe know that the first 10 years of a career\nhas an exponential impact\non how much money you\'re going to earn.\nWe know that more than half of Americans\nare married or are living with or dating\ntheir future partner by 30.\nWe know that the brain caps off its second\nand last growth spurt in your 20s\nas it rewires itself for adulthood,\nwhich means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,\nnow is the time to change it.\nWe know that personality changes more during your 20s\nthan at any other time in life,\nand we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,\nand things get tricky after age 35.\nSo your 20s are the time to educate yourself\nabout your body and your options.'
p866
aS"\nSo when we think about child development,\nwe all know that the first five years are a critical period\nfor language and attachment in the brain.\nIt's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life\nhas an inordinate impact on who you will become.\nBut what we hear less about is that there's such a thing\nas adult development, and our 20s\nare that critical period of adult development."
p867
aS'\nBut this isn\'t what twentysomethings are hearing.\nNewspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.\nResearchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.\nJournalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings\nlike "twixters" and "kidults."\nIt\'s true.\nAs a culture, we have trivialized what is actually\nthe defining decade of adulthood.'
p868
aS'\nLeonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,\nyou need a plan and not quite enough time.\nIsn\'t that true?\nSo what do you think happens\nwhen you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,\n"You have 10 extra years to start your life"?\nNothing happens.\nYou have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,\nand absolutely nothing happens.'
p869
aS'\nAnd then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings\nlike you or like your sons and daughters\ncome into my office and say things like this:\n"I know my boyfriend\'s no good for me,\nbut this relationship doesn\'t count. I\'m just killing time."\nOr they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started\non a career by the time I\'m 30, I\'ll be fine."'
p870
aS'\nBut then it starts to sound like this:\n"My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.\nI had a better rsum the day after I graduated from college."'
p871
aS'\nAnd then it starts to sound like this:\n"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.\nEverybody was running around and having fun,\nbut then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off\nand everybody started sitting down.\nI didn\'t want to be the only one left standing up,\nso sometimes I think I married my husband\nbecause he was the closest chair to me at 30."'
p872
aS'\nWhere are the twentysomethings here?\nDo not do that.'
p873
aS'\nOkay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,\nthe stakes are very high.\nWhen a lot has been pushed to your 30s,\nthere is enormous thirtysomething pressure\nto jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,\nand have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.\nMany of these things are incompatible,\nand as research is just starting to show,\nsimply harder and more stressful to do\nall at once in our 30s.'
p874
aS'\nThe post-millennial midlife crisis\nisn\'t buying a red sports car.\nIt\'s realizing you can\'t have that career you now want.\nIt\'s realizing you can\'t have that child you now want,\nor you can\'t give your child a sibling.\nToo many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings\nlook at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,\nand say about their 20s,\n"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"'
p875
aS'\nI want to change what twentysomethings\nare doing and thinking.'
p876
aS'\nHere\'s a story about how that can go.\nIt\'s a story about a woman named Emma.\nAt 25, Emma came to my office\nbecause she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.\nShe said she thought she might like to work in art\nor entertainment, but she hadn\'t decided yet,\nso she\'d spent the last few years waiting tables instead.\nBecause it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend\nwho displayed his temper more than his ambition.\nAnd as hard as her 20s were,\nher early life had been even harder.\nShe often cried in our sessions,\nbut then would collect herself by saying,\n"You can\'t pick your family, but you can pick your friends."'
p877
aS'\nWell one day, Emma comes in\nand she hangs her head in her lap,\nand she sobbed for most of the hour.\nShe\'d just bought a new address book,\nand she\'d spent the morning filling in her many contacts,\nbut then she\'d been left staring at that empty blank\nthat comes after the words\n"In case of emergency, please call ... ."\nShe was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,\n"Who\'s going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?\nWho\'s going to take care of me if I have cancer?"'
p878
aS'\nNow in that moment, it took everything I had\nnot to say, "I will."\nBut what Emma needed wasn\'t some therapist\nwho really, really cared.\nEmma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.\nI had learned too much since I first worked with Alex\nto just sit there while Emma\'s defining decade\nwent parading by.'
p879
aS'\nSo over the next weeks and months,\nI told Emma\nthree things that every twentysomething, male or female,\ndeserves to hear.'
p880
aS"\nFirst, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis\nand get some identity capital.\nBy get identity capital, I mean do something\nthat adds value to who you are.\nDo something that's an investment\nin who you might want to be next.\nI didn't know the future of Emma's career,\nand no one knows the future of work, but I do know this:\nIdentity capital begets identity capital.\nSo now is the time for that cross-country job,\nthat internship, that startup you want to try.\nI'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,\nbut I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,\nwhich, by the way, is not exploration.\nThat's procrastination.\nI told Emma to explore work and make it count."
p881
aS"\nSecond, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.\nBest friends are great for giving rides to the airport,\nbut twentysomethings who huddle together\nwith like-minded peers limit who they know,\nwhat they know, how they think, how they speak,\nand where they work.\nThat new piece of capital, that new person to date\nalmost always comes from outside the inner circle.\nNew things come from what are called our weak ties,\nour friends of friends of friends.\nSo yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.\nBut half aren't, and weak ties\nare how you get yourself into that group.\nHalf of new jobs are never posted,\nso reaching out to your neighbor's boss\nis how you get that un-posted job.\nIt's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads."
p882
aS"\nLast but not least, Emma believed that\nyou can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.\nNow this was true for her growing up,\nbut as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family\nwhen she partnered with someone\nand created a family of her own.\nI told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.\nNow you may be thinking that 30\nis actually a better time to settle down\nthan 20, or even 25,\nand I agree with you.\nBut grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with\nwhen everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle\nis not progress.\nThe best time to work on your marriage\nis before you have one,\nand that means being as intentional with love\nas you are with work.\nPicking your family is about consciously choosing\nwho and what you want\nrather than just making it work or killing time\nwith whoever happens to be choosing you."
p883
aS'\nSo what happened to Emma?\nWell, we went through that address book,\nand she found an old roommate\'s cousin\nwho worked at an art museum in another state.\nThat weak tie helped her get a job there.\nThat job offer gave her the reason\nto leave that live-in boyfriend.\nNow, five years later, she\'s a special events planner for museums.\nShe\'s married to a man she mindfully chose.\nShe loves her new career, she loves her new family,\nand she sent me a card that said,\n"Now the emergency contact blanks\ndon\'t seem big enough."'
p884
aS"\nNow Emma's story made that sound easy,\nbut that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.\nThey are so easy to help.\nTwentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,\nbound for somewhere west.\nRight after takeoff, a slight change in course\nis the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.\nLikewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,\none good conversation, one good break,\none good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect\nacross years and even generations to come."
p885
aS"\nSo here's an idea worth spreading\nto every twentysomething you know.\nIt's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.\nIt's what I now have the privilege\nof saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:\nThirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,\nget some identity capital, use your weak ties,\npick your family.\nDon't be defined by what you didn't know\nor didn't do.\nYou're deciding your life right now.\nThank you.\n(Applause)"

S'\nWell, good morning ladies and gentlemen.\nMy name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."\nWhat that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic\nto do something I call "mathemagics."\nBut before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.\nBy any chance, did anyone happen\nto bring with them this morning a calculator?\nSeriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand, raise your hand.'
p888
aS"\nI -- was -- your hand go up?\nNow bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?\nI see, I see one way in the back.\nYou sir, that's three,\nAnd anybody on this side here?\nOK, you over there on the aisle. Would the four of you with calculators\nplease bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage.\nAnd let's give these volunteers a nice round of applause."
p889
aS'\n(Applause)'
p890
aS"\nThat's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance\nto work with these calculators, I need to make sure\nthat they are all working properly.\nWould somebody get us started by giving us a\ntwo-digit number please?\nHow about a two-digit number?"
p891
aS'\nAudience: 22.'
p892
aS'\nArthur Benjamin: 22. And another two-digit number, Sir?'
p893
aS'\nAudience: 47.'
p894

p897

p898
aS"\nWould you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?\nOK, great.\nWhat I'm going to try and do then --\nI notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.\nThat's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying\neven faster on the calculator.\nThere is something called the square of a number,\nwhich most of you know is taking a number\nand multiplying it by itself.\nFor instance, five squared would be?"
p899
aS'\nAudience: 25.'
p900
aS'\nAB: 25. Now, the way we can square on most calculators --\nlet me demonstrate with this one --\nis by taking the number, such as five,\nhitting "times" and then "equals,"\nand on most calculators that will give you the square.\nOn some of these ancient RPN calculators,\nyou\'ve got an "x squared" button on it,\nwill allow you to do the calculation even faster.\nWhat I\'m going to try and do now is to square, in my head,\nfour two-digit numbers\nfaster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method.\nWhat I\'ll use is the second row this time, and I\'ll get four of you --\none, two, three, four -- to each yell out a two-digit number,\nand if you would square the first number,\nand if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,\nI will try and race you to the answer. OK?\nSo quickly, a two-digit number please.'

S'\nProbably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen\nwho went down to Africa in the 1900s.\nThey were sent down to find if there was any opportunity\nfor selling shoes,\nand they wrote telegrams back to Manchester.\nAnd one of them wrote, "Situation hopeless. Stop.\nThey don\'t wear shoes."\nAnd the other one wrote, "Glorious opportunity.\nThey don\'t have any shoes yet."\n(Laughter)'
p1020
aS"\nNow, there's a similar situation in the classical music world,\nbecause there are some people who think\nthat classical music is dying.\nAnd there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.\nAnd rather than go into statistics and trends,\nand tell you about all the orchestras that are closing,\nand the record companies that are folding,\nI thought we should do an experiment tonight -- an experiment.\nActually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome."
p1021
aS"\nBut it's like an experiment. Now, before we --\n(Laughter)\n-- before we start, I need to do two things.\nOne is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child\nsounds like when he plays the piano.\nMaybe you have this child at home.\nHe sounds something like this.\n(Piano)\nI see some of you recognize this child.\nNow, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight\nand he sounds like this.\n(Piano)\nThen he practices for another year and takes lessons -- now he's nine.\n(Piano)\nThen he practices for another and takes lessons -- now he's 10.\n(Piano)\nAt that point, they usually give up.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nNow, if you'd waited, if you'd waited for one more year,\nyou would have heard this.\n(Piano)"
p1022
aS'\nNow, what happened was not maybe what you thought,\nwhich is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged,\ninvolved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is.\nWhat actually happened was the impulses were reduced.\nYou see, the first time, he was playing\nwith an impulse on every note.\n(Piano)\nAnd the second, with an impulse every other note.\n(Piano)\nYou can see it by looking at my head.\n(Laughter)\nThe nine-year-old\nput an impulse on every four notes.\n(Piano)\nAnd the 10-year-old, on every eight notes.\n(Piano)\nAnd the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.\n(Piano)'
p1023
aS'\nI know -- I don\'t know how we got into this position.\n(Laughter)\nI didn\'t say, "I\'m going to move my shoulder over, move my body."\nNo, the music pushed me over,\nwhich is why I call it one-buttock playing.\n(Piano)\nIt can be the other buttock.\n(Piano)\nYou know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing,\nwhen I was working with a young pianist.\nHe was the president of a corporation in Ohio.\nAnd I was working with this young pianist\nand I said, "The trouble with you is you\'re a two-buttock player.\nYou should be a one-buttock player."\nAnd I moved his body like that, while he was playing.\nAnd suddenly, the music took off. It took flight.\nThere was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference.\nAnd then I got a letter from this gentleman.\nHe said, "I was so moved.\nI went back and I transformed my entire company\ninto a one-buttock company."\n(Laughter)'
p1024
aS'\nNow, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you.\nThere are 1,600 people, I believe.\nMy estimation is that probably 45 of you\nare absolutely passionate about classical music.\nYou adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial.\nAnd you have CDs in your car, and you go to the symphony.\nAnd your children are playing instruments.\nYou can\'t imagine your life without classical music.\nThat\'s the first group; it\'s quite a small group.\nThen there\'s another group, bigger group.\nThese are the people who don\'t mind classical music.\n(Laughter)\nYou know, you\'ve come home from a long day,\nand you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up.\nA little Vivaldi in the background doesn\'t do any harm.\n(Laughter)\nThat\'s the second group.\nNow comes the third group.\nThese are the people who never listen to classical music.\nIt\'s just simply not part of your life.\nYou might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport, but --\n(Laughter)\n-- and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida"\nwhen you come into the hall. But otherwise, you never hear it.\nThat\'s probably the largest group of all.'
p1025
aS'\nAnd then there\'s a very small group.\nThese are the people who think they\'re tone-deaf.\nAmazing number of people think they\'re tone-deaf.\nActually, I hear a lot, "My husband is tone-deaf."\n(Laughter)\nActually, you cannot be tone-deaf. Nobody is tone-deaf.\nIf you were tone-deaf, you couldn\'t change the gears\non your car, in a stick shift car.\nYou couldn\'t tell the difference between\nsomebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.\nAnd the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls\non the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello,"\nyou not only know who it is, you know what mood she\'s in.\nYou have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear.\nSo nobody is tone-deaf.'
p1026
aS"\nBut I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing,\nwith such a wide gulf between those who understand,\nlove and [are] passionate about classical music,\nand those who have no relationship to it at all.\nThe tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.\nBut even between those three categories, it's too wide a gulf.\nSo I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room,\ndownstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking,\nwill come to love and understand classical music.\nSo that's what we're going to do."
p1027
aS'\nNow, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind\nthat this is going to work if you look at my face, right?\nIt\'s one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt\nfor one moment the capacity of the people he\'s leading\nto realize whatever he\'s dreaming.\nImagine if Martin Luther King had said, "I have a dream.\nOf course, I\'m not sure they\'ll be up to it."\n(Laughter)'
p1028
aS'\nAll right. So I\'m going to take a piece of Chopin.\nThis is a beautiful prelude by Chopin. Some of you will know it.\n(Music)\nDo you know what I think probably happened in this room?\nWhen I started, you thought, "How beautiful that sounds."\n(Music)\n"I don\'t think we should go to the same place\nfor our summer holidays next year."\n(Laughter)\nIt\'s funny, isn\'t it? It\'s funny how those thoughts\nkind of waft into your head.\nAnd of course --\n(Applause)\n-- and of course, if the piece is long and you\'ve had a long day,\nyou might actually drift off.\nThen your companion will dig you in the ribs\nand say, "Wake up! It\'s culture!" And then you feel even worse.'
p1029
aS'\nBut has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy\nin classical music is not because of you, but because of us?\nDid anybody think while I was playing,\n"Why is he using so many impulses?"\nIf I\'d done this with my head you certainly would have thought it.\n(Music)\nAnd for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music,\nyou\'ll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.'
p1030
aS"\nSo let's see what's really going on here.\nWe have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C.\nAnd the job of the C is to make the B sad. And it does, doesn't it?\n(Laughter)\nComposers know that. If they want sad music,\nthey just play those two notes.\n(Music)\nBut basically, it's just a B, with four sads.\n(Laughter)\nNow, it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F.\nSo we have B, A, G, F. And if we have B, A, G, F,\nwhat do we expect next? Oh, that might have been a fluke.\nLet's try it again. Ooh, the TED choir.\n(Laughter)\nAnd you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right? Nobody is.\nYou know, every village in Bangladesh\nand every hamlet in China -- everybody knows:\nda, da, da, da -- da. Everybody knows, who's expecting that E."
p1031
aS'\nNow, Chopin didn\'t want to reach the E there,\nbecause what will have happened? It will be over, like Hamlet.\nDo you remember Hamlet? Act one, scene three,\nhe finds out that his uncle killed his father.\nYou remember, he keeps on going up to his uncle\nand almost killing him. And then he backs away,\nand he goes up to him again and almost kills him.\nAnd the critics, all of whom are sitting in the back row there,\nthey have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."\n(Laughter)\nOr they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex."\nNo, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.\nThat\'s why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet --\nyou know, Ophelia going mad and the play within the play,\nand Yorick\'s skull, and the gravediggers.\nThat\'s in order to delay -- until act five, he can kill him.'
p1032
aS'\nIt\'s the same with the Chopin. He\'s just about to reach the E,\nand he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again."\nSo he does it again.\nNow, he gets excited. (Piano) That\'s excitement,\nyou don\'t have to worry about it.\nNow, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E,\nbut it\'s the wrong chord -- because the chord he\'s looking for\nis this one, (Piano) and instead he does ...\n(Piano) Now, we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives us.\nI always tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence,\nbe sure to raise your eyebrows. Then everybody will know."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nRight. So, he gets to E, but it\'s the wrong chord.\nNow, he tries E again. That chord doesn\'t work.\nNow, he tries the E again. That chord doesn\'t work.\nNow, he tries E again, and that doesn\'t work.\nAnd then finally ... (Piano)\nThere was a gentleman in the front row who went, "Mmm."\nIt\'s the same gesture he makes when he comes home\nafter a long day, turns off the key in his car and says,\n"Aah, I\'m home." Because we all know where home is.'
p1033
aS"\nSo this is a piece which goes from away to home.\nAnd I'm going to play it all the way through\nand you're going to follow. B, C, B, C, B, C, B --\ndown to A, down to G, down to F.\nAlmost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over.\nHe goes back up to B. He gets very excited. Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.\nIt's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord.\nAnd finally goes to E, and it's home.\nAnd what you're going to see is one-buttock playing.\n(Laughter)\nBecause for me, to join the B to the E,\nI have to stop thinking about every single note along the way,\nand start thinking about the long, long line from B to E."
p1034
aS"\nYou know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa\nwithout thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years.\nWhat was he thinking about? Lunch?\nNo, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa\nand for human beings. That's what kept --\nthis is about vision. This is about the long line.\nLike the bird who flies over the field\nand doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right?\nSo now, you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E.\nAnd I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through.\nWould you think of somebody who you adore, who's no longer there?\nA beloved grandmother, a lover --\nsomebody in your life who you love with all your heart,\nbut that person is no longer with you.\nBring that person into your mind, and at the same time\nfollow the line all the way from B to E,\nand you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.\n(Music)\n(Applause)"
p1035
aS'\nNow, you may be wondering,\nyou may be wondering why I\'m clapping.\nWell, I did this at a school in Boston\nwith about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.\nAnd I did exactly what I did with you, and I told them\nand explained them and the whole thing.\nAnd at the end, they went crazy, clapping. They were clapping.\nI was clapping. They were clapping.\nFinally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"\nAnd one of the little kids said, "Because we were listening."\n(Laughter)\nThink of it. 1,600 people, busy people,\ninvolved in all sorts of different things,\nlistening, understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin.\nNow that is something.\nNow, am I sure that every single person followed that,\nunderstood it, was moved by it? Of course, I can\'t be sure.\nBut I tell you what happened to me.'
p1036
aS'\nI was in Ireland during the Troubles, 10 years ago,\nand I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids\non conflict resolution. And I did this with them --\na risky thing to do, because they were street kids.\nAnd one of them came to me the next morning and he said,\n"You know, I\'ve never listened to classical music in my life,\nbut when you played that shopping piece ... "\n(Laughter)\nHe said, "My brother was shot last year and I didn\'t cry for him.\nBut last night, when you played that piece,\nhe was the one I was thinking about.\nAnd I felt the tears streaming down my face.\nAnd you know, it felt really good to cry for my brother."\nSo I made up my mind at that moment\nthat classical music is for everybody. Everybody.'
p1037
aS'\nNow, how would you walk -- because you know,\nmy profession, the music profession doesn\'t see it that way.\nThey say three percent of the population likes classical music.\nIf only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.\nI say, "How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be?\nIf you thought, three percent of the population likes classical music,\nif only we could move it to four percent. How would you walk?\nHow would you talk? How would you be?\nIf you thought, everybody loves classical music --\nthey just haven\'t found out about it yet."\n(Laughter)\nSee, these are totally different worlds.'
p1038
aS'\nNow, I had an amazing experience. I was 45 years old,\nI\'d been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly had a realization.\nThe conductor of an orchestra doesn\'t make a sound.\nMy picture appears on the front of the CD --\n(Laughter)\n-- but the conductor doesn\'t make a sound.\nHe depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful.\nAnd that changed everything for me. It was totally life changing.\nPeople in my orchestra came up to me and said,\n"Ben, what happened?" That\'s what happened.\nI realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.\nAnd of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.\nAnd you know how you find out? You look at their eyes.\nIf their eyes are shining, you know you\'re doing it.\nYou could light up a village with this guy\'s eyes.\n(Laughter)\nRight. So if the eyes are shining, you know you\'re doing it.\nIf the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.\nAnd this is the question:\nwho am I being, that my players\' eyes are not shining?\nWe can do that with our children, too.\nWho am I being, that my children\'s eyes are not shining?\nThat\'s a totally different world.'
p1039
aS"\nNow, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week,\nand we're going back into the world.\nAnd I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question,\nwho are we being as we go back out into the world?\nAnd you know, I have a definition of success.\nFor me, it's very simple. It's not about wealth and fame and power.\nIt's about how many shining eyes I have around me."
p1040
aS'\nSo now, I have one last thought, which is\nthat it really makes a difference what we say --\nthe words that come out of our mouth.\nI learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz,\none of the rare survivors.\nShe went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old,\nand her brother was eight, and the parents were lost.\nAnd she told me this, she said,\n"We were in the train going to Auschwitz, and I looked down\nand saw my brother\'s shoes were missing.\nAnd I said, \'Why are you so stupid, can\'t you keep your things together\nfor goodness\' sake?\' " The way an elder sister\nmight speak to a younger brother.\nUnfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him,\nbecause she never saw him again. He did not survive.\nAnd so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.\nShe told me this. She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life\nand I made a vow. And the vow was, I will never say anything\nthat couldn\'t stand as the last thing I ever say."\nNow, can we do that? No. And we\'ll make ourselves wrong\nand others wrong. But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you.\n(Applause)\nShining eyes, shining eyes.\nThank you, thank you.\n(Music)'
p1041
aa(lp1042
S'\nThere is nothing bigger or older than the universe.\nThe questions I would like to talk about are:\none, where did we come from?\nHow did the universe come into being?\nAre we alone in the universe?\nIs there alien life out there?\nWhat is the future of the human race?'
p1043
aS'\nUp until the 1920s,\neveryone thought the universe was essentially static\nand unchanging in time.\nThen it was discovered that the universe was expanding.\nDistant galaxies were moving away from us.\nThis meant they must have been closer together in the past.\nIf we extrapolate back,\nwe find we must have all been on top of each other\nabout 15 billion years ago.\nThis was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.'
p1044
aS"\nBut was there anything before the Big Bang?\nIf not, what created the universe?\nWhy did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?\nWe used to think that the theory of the universe\ncould be divided into two parts.\nFirst, there were the laws\nlike Maxwell's equations and general relativity\nthat determined the evolution of the universe,\ngiven its state over all of space at one time.\nAnd second, there was no question\nof the initial state of the universe."
p1045
aS'\nWe have made good progress on the first part,\nand now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution\nin all but the most extreme conditions.\nBut until recently, we have had little idea\nabout the initial conditions for the universe.\nHowever, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions\ndepends on time and space being separate and distinct.\nUnder extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory\nallow time to behave like another dimension of space.\nThis removes the distinction between time and space,\nand means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.\nThe universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.'
p1046
aS'\nMoreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe\nwas created in different states.\nThese predictions are in excellent agreement\nwith observations by the WMAP satellite\nof the cosmic microwave background,\nwhich is an imprint of the very early universe.\nWe think we have solved the mystery of creation.\nMaybe we should patent the universe\nand charge everyone royalties for their existence.'
p1047
aS'\nI now turn to the second big question:\nare we alone, or is there other life in the universe?\nWe believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth,\nso it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets,\nof which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.'
p1048
aS"\nBut we don't know how life first appeared.\nWe have two pieces of observational evidence\non the probability of life appearing.\nThe first is that we have fossils of algae\nfrom 3.5 billion years ago.\nThe Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago\nand was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.\nSo life appeared on Earth\nwithin half a billion years of it being possible,\nwhich is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime\nof a planet of Earth type.\nThis suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high.\nIf it was very low, one would have expected it\nto take most of the ten billion years available."
p1049
aS"\nOn the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.\nI am discounting the reports of UFOs.\nWhy would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes?\nIf there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports\nand keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring,\nit seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.\nFurthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project,\nwe haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.\nThis probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations\nat our stage of development\nwithin a radius of a few hundred light years.\nIssuing an insurance policy\nagainst abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet."
p1050
aS'\nThis brings me to the last of the big questions:\nthe future of the human race.\nIf we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy,\nwe should make sure we survive and continue.\nBut we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.\nOur population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth\nare growing exponentially, along with our technical ability\nto change the environment for good or ill.\nBut our genetic code\nstill carries the selfish and aggressive instincts\nthat were of survival advantage in the past.\nIt will be difficult enough to avoid disaster\nin the next hundred years,\nlet alone the next thousand or million.'
p1051
aS'\nOur only chance of long-term survival\nis not to remain lurking on planet Earth,\nbut to spread out into space.\nThe answers to these big questions\nshow that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.\nBut if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years,\nour future is in space.\nThat is why I am in favor of manned --\nor should I say, personed -- space flight.'
p1052
aS'\nAll of my life I have sought to understand the universe\nand find answers to these questions.\nI have been very lucky\nthat my disability has not been a serious handicap.\nIndeed, it has probably given me more time than most people\nto pursue the quest for knowledge.\nThe ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe,\nand we are making good progress.\nThank you for listening.'
p1053
aS'\nChris Anderson: Professor, if you had to guess either way,\ndo you now believe that it is more likely than not\nthat we are alone in the Milky Way,\nas a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?\nThis answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight\ninto the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.'
p1054
aS"\nStephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization\nwithin several hundred light years;\notherwise we would have heard radio waves.\nThe alternative is that civilizations don't last very long,\nbut destroy themselves.\nCA: Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.\nWe will take it as a salutary warning, I think,\nfor the rest of our conference this week.\nProfessor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made\nto share your questions with us today.\nThank you very much indeed.\n(Applause)"

Shakespeare said.\nI think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question\nsince they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago.\nI started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was\nby looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research --\nand as it turns out, there\'s a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.\nThe first thing that happens is what I call --\na person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."\nAs a truck driver once said to me,\nhe said, "The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."'
p1058
aS'\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said it a little differently.\nHe said, "Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another."\nAnd indeed, that\'s what we do. (Laughter)\nAnd then you just focus on this person.\nYou can list what you don\'t like about them,\nbut then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.\nAs Chaucer said, "Love is blind."'
p1059
aS"\nIn trying to understand romantic love,\nI decided I would read poetry from all over the world,\nand I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China,\nbecause it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.\nIt's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody\nand you walk into a parking lot --\ntheir car is different from every other car in the parking lot.\nTheir wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.\nAnd in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat."
p1060
aS'\nAnd it goes like this. It\'s by a guy called Yuan Chen:\n"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.\nThe night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."\nHe became hooked on a sleeping mat,\nprobably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain,\njust like with you and me.'
p1061
aS'\nBut anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning,\nyou focus your attention on them.\nYou aggrandize them. But you have intense energy.\nAs one Polynesian said, he said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."\nYou\'re up all night. You\'re walking till dawn.\nYou feel intense elation when things are going well;\nmood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.\nReal dependence on this person.\nAs one businessman in New York said to me, he said, "Anything she liked, I liked."\nSimple. Romantic love is very simple.'
p1062
aS"\nYou become extremely sexually possessive.\nYou know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,\nyou don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.\nBut the moment you fall in love,\nyou become extremely sexually possessive of them.\nI think that that is a Darwinian -- there's a Darwinian purpose to this.\nThe whole point of this is to pull two people together\nstrongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team."
p1063
aS"\nBut the main characteristics of romantic love are craving:\nan intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally.\nYou'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them,\nbut you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,\nto tell you that they love you.\nThe other main characteristic is motivation.\nThe motor in your brain begins to crank, and you want this person."
p1064
aS'\nAnd last but not least, it is an obsession.\nWhen I put these people in the machine, before I put them in the MRI machine,\nI would ask them all kinds of questions.\nBut my most important question was always the same.\nIt was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"\nAnd indeed, they would say, "All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her."'
p1065
aS'\nAnd then, the very last question I would ask them --\nI would always have to work myself up to this question,\nbecause I am not a psychologist.\nI don\'t work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.\nAnd my final question was always the same.\nI would say, "Would you die for him or her?"\nAnd, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"\nas if I had asked them to pass the salt.\nI was just staggered by it.'
p1066
aS"\nSo we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph,\nwith a distraction task in between.\nSo we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state\nand when it was in a resting state.\nAnd we found activity in a lot of brain regions.\nIn fact, one of the most important was a brain region\nthat becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.\nAnd indeed, that's exactly what happens."
p1067
aS"\nI began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.\nIn fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions,\nfrom very high to very low.\nBut actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind,\nthe wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.\nThe kind of mind -- part of the mind --\nwhen you're reaching for that piece of chocolate,\nwhen you want to win that promotion at work.\nThe motor of the brain. It's a drive."
p1068
aS'\nAnd in fact, I think it\'s more powerful than the sex drive.\nYou know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, "No, thank you,"\nyou certainly don\'t kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.\nBut certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it.\nPeople live for love. They kill for love. They die for love.\nThey have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.\nIn over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.\nI have come to think it\'s one of the most powerful brain systems on earth\nfor both great joy and great sorrow.'
p1069
aS'\nAnd I\'ve also come to think that it\'s one of three\nbasically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction.\nOne is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.\nW.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch,"\nand indeed, that\'s what it is.\nIt keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.\nThe second of these three brain systems is romantic love:\nthat elation, obsession of early love.\nAnd the third brain system is attachment:\nthat sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.'
p1070
aS"\nAnd I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there,\nlooking for a whole range of partners.\nYou know, you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.\nIt can be focused on nobody.\nI think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy\non just one individual at a time,\nthereby conserving mating time and energy.\nAnd I think that attachment, the third brain system,\nevolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- (Laughter) --\nat least long enough to raise a child together as a team."
p1071
aS'\nSo with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.\nOne of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years,\nthat are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:\nlust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.'
p1072
aS"\nThe first is women working, moving into the workforce.\nI've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.\nAnd everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market --\nsometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market --\nand they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women\nin terms of economic power, health and education.\nIt's very slow."
p1073
aS'\nFor every trend on this planet, there\'s a counter-trend.\nWe all know of them, but nevertheless --\nthe Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."\nAnd, indeed, that caravan is moving on.\nWomen are moving back into the job market.\nAnd I say back into the job market, because this is not new.\nFor millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa,\nwomen commuted to work to gather their vegetables.\nThey came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.\nThe double income family was the standard.\nAnd women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men.\nIn short, we\'re really moving forward to the past.'
p1074
aS"\nThen, women's worst invention was the plow.\nWith the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.\nWomen lost their ancient jobs as collectors,\nbut then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution\nthey're moving back into the job market.\nIn short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,\n10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.\nWe are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal.\nAnd it's going to have an impact."
p1075
aS"\nI generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community.\nI'll only just say a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.\nThere's a lot of gender differences;\nanybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child.\nI don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike.\nThere's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we\ndo not have in common."
p1076
aS'\nWe are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,\n"I think that we were built to be -- we\'re like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."\nBut we did not evolve to have the same brain.\nAnd we\'re finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain.\nI\'ll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.\nOne of them is women\'s verbal ability. Women can talk.'
p1077
aS"\nWomen's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation\ngoes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.\nBut even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.\nWomen can talk.\nThey've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.\nThey held that baby in front of their face,\ncajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.\nAnd, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force."
p1078
aS'\nEven in places like India and Japan,\nwhere women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,\nthey\'re moving into journalism.\nAnd I think that the television is like the global campfire.\nWe sit around it and it shapes our minds.\nAlmost always, when I\'m on TV, the producers who call me,\nwho negotiate what we\'re going to say, is a woman.\nIn fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,\n"To have a great writer is to have another government."'
p1079
aS"\nToday 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.\nIt's one of many, many characteristics that women have\nthat they will bring into the job market.\nThey've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.\nThey're highly imaginative.\nWe now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.\nThey tend to be web thinkers.\nBecause the female parts of the brain are better connected,\nthey tend to collect more pieces of data when they think,\nput them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.\nThey tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers."
p1080
aS"\nMen tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous,\nfocus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.\nThey're both perfectly good ways of thinking.\nWe need both of them to get ahead.\nIn fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.\nWhen the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world. (Laughter)\nWhen the male brain works well, it works extremely well.\nAnd what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society,\na society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood\nand valued and employed."
p1081
aS'\nBut in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact\non sex and romance and family life.\nForemost, women are starting to express their sexuality.\nI\'m always astonished when people come to me and say,\n"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"\nAnd I say, "Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"\n"Oh, well -- men are more adulterous!"\nAnd I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"\nAnd -- basic math! (Laughter)'
p1082
aS"\nAnyway.\nIn the Western world,\nwomen start sooner at sex, have more partners,\nexpress less remorse for the partners that they do,\nmarry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones.\nWe are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.\nAnd, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression\nthat we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,\nbecause this is the kind of sexual expression that we see\nin hunting and gathering societies today."
p1083
aS'\nWe\'re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.\nThey\'re now saying that the 21st century\nis going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"\nor the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."\nThis is a marriage between equals,\nmoving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.'
p1084
aS"\nWe're also seeing a rise of romantic love.\n91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men\nwould not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner,\nif they were not in love with that person.\nPeople around the world, in a study of 37 societies,\nwant to be in love with the person that they marry.\nIndeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life."
p1085
aS"\nI even think that marriages might even become more stable\nbecause of the second great world trend.\nThe first one being women moving into the job market,\nthe second one being the aging world population.\nThey're now saying that in America,\nthat middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.\nBecause in that highest age category of 76 to 85,\nas much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.\nSo we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age."
p1086
aS"\nAnd I looked -- for one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.\nAnd as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.\nSo the divorce rate right now is stable in America,\nand it's actually beginning to decline.\nIt may decline some more.\nI would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements\nand the incredibly interesting women\n-- women have never been as interesting as they are now.\nNot at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable.\nAnd so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution\nwhen we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now."
p1087
aS"\nHowever, there's always kinds of complications in this.\nIn these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment --\ndon't always go together.\nThey can go together, by the way.\nThat's why casual sex isn't so casual.\nWith orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.\nDopamine's associated with romantic love,\nand you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with.\nWith orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin --\nthose are associated with attachment.\nThis is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody\nafter you've made love to them."
p1088
aS"\nBut these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment,\naren't always connected to each other.\nYou can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner\nwhile you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,\nwhile you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.\nIn short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.\nIn fact, you can lie in bed at night\nand swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person\nto deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.\nIt's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head\nas you are trying to decide what to do.\nSo I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy;\nwe are an animal that was built to reproduce.\nI think the happiness we find, we make.\nAnd I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other."
p1089
aS"\nSo I want to conclude with two things.\nI want to conclude with a worry --\nI have a worry -- and with a wonderful story.\nThe worry is about antidepressants.\nOver 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States.\nAnd these drugs are going generic.\nThey are seeping around the world.\nI know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, serotonin-enhancing --\nSSRI, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.\nShe's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13."
p1090
aS"\nI've got nothing against people who take them short term,\nwhen they're going through something perfectly horrible.\nThey want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.\nI would recommend it.\nBut more and more people in the United States are taking them long term.\nAnd indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.\nAnd by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.\nEverybody knows that.\nDopamine is associated with romantic love.\nNot only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive.\nAnd when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.\nAnd when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.\nThe things are connected in the brain.\nAnd when you tamper with one brain system,\nyou're going to tamper with another.\nI'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place."
p1091
aS"\nSo now -- (Applause) -- thank you.\nI want to end with a story. And then, just a comment.\nI've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.\nI'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.\nWhy you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese\nand the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike."
p1092
aS'\nAnd about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me\nand asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.\nI said, "I don\'t know anything about personality. You know?\nI don\'t know. Do you think you\'ve got the right person?"\nThey said, "Yes."\nIt got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another.'
p1093
aS'\nThat\'s my current project; it will be my next book.\nThere\'s all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another.\nTiming is important. Proximity is important.\nMystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who\'s somewhat mysterious,\nin part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain,\nprobably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.\nYou fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your "love map,"\nan unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up.\nAnd I also think that you\ngravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.\nAnd that\'s what I\'m now contributing to this.'
p1094
aS"\nBut I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate.\nI've been carrying on here about the biology of love.\nI wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too --\nthe magic of it.\nIt's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the --\nprobably a true story.\nIt was a graduate student at -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --\nArt Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.\nThat's where we put our people in the MRI machine."
p1095
aS"\nAnd this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student,\nand she was not in love with him.\nAnd they were all at a conference in Beijing.\nAnd he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody,\nyou can drive up the dopamine in the brain,\nand perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. (Laughter)\nSo he decided he'd put science to work,\nand he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him."
p1096
aS'\nAnd sure enough -- I\'ve never been in one,\nbut apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks\nand it\'s crazy and it\'s noisy and it\'s exciting.\nAnd he figured that this would drive up the dopamine,\nand she would fall in love with him.\nSo off they go and she\'s squealing and squeezing him\nand laughing and having a wonderful time.\nAn hour later they get down off of the rickshaw,\nand she throws her hands up and she says, "Wasn\'t that wonderful?"\nAnd, "Wasn\'t that rickshaw driver handsome!"\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p1097
aS'\nThere\'s magic to love!\nBut I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives:\nthe sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner.\nThese circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.\nThey\'re going to survive as long as our species survives\non what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."\nThank you. (Applause)'
p1098
aa(lp1099
S'\nSo what does it mean for a machine to be athletic?\nWe will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism\nand the research to achieve it\nwith the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters,\nor quads, for short.'
p1100
aS"\nQuads have been around for a long time.\nThe reason that they're so popular these days\nis because they're mechanically simple.\nBy controlling the speeds of these four propellers,\nthese machines can roll, pitch, yaw,\nand accelerate along their common orientation.\nOn board are also a battery, a computer,\nvarious sensors and wireless radios."
p1101
aS'\nQuads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost.\nThey are inherently unstable, and they need some form\nof automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly.'
p1102
aS"\nSo, how did it just do that?\nCameras on the ceiling and a laptop\nserve as an indoor global positioning system.\nIt's used to locate objects in the space\nthat have these reflective markers on them.\nThis data is then sent to another laptop\nthat is running estimation and control algorithms,\nwhich in turn sends commands to the quad,\nwhich is also running estimation and control algorithms.\nThe bulk of our research is algorithms.\nIt's the magic that brings these machines to life."
p1103
aS"\nSo how does one design the algorithms\nthat create a machine athlete?\nWe use something broadly called model-based design.\nWe first capture the physics with a mathematical model\nof how the machines behave.\nWe then use a branch of mathematics\ncalled control theory to analyze these models\nand also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them.\nFor example, that's how we can make the quad hover.\nWe first captured the dynamics\nwith a set of differential equations.\nWe then manipulate these equations with the help\nof control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad."
p1104
aS"\nLet me demonstrate the strength of this approach.\nSuppose that we want this quad to not only hover\nbut to also balance this pole.\nWith a little bit of practice,\nit's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this,\nalthough we do have the advantage of having\ntwo feet on the ground\nand the use of our very versatile hands.\nIt becomes a little bit more difficult\nwhen I only have one foot on the ground\nand when I don't use my hands.\nNotice how this pole has a reflective marker on top,\nwhich means that it can be located in the space."
p1105
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1106
aS"\nYou can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments\nto keep the pole balanced.\nHow did we design the algorithms to do this?\nWe added the mathematical model of the pole\nto that of the quad.\nOnce we have a model of the combined quad-pole system,\nwe can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.\nHere, you see that it's stable,\nand even if I give it little nudges,\nit goes back to the nice, balanced position."
p1107
aS"\nWe can also augment the model to include\nwhere we want the quad to be in space.\nUsing this pointer, made out of reflective markers,\nI can point to where I want the quad to be in space\na fixed distance away from me.\nThe key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms,\ndesigned with the help of mathematical models\nand control theory.\nLet's tell the quad to come back here\nand let the pole drop,\nand I will next demonstrate the importance\nof understanding physical models\nand the workings of the physical world.\nNotice how the quad lost altitude\nwhen I put this glass of water on it.\nUnlike the balancing pole, I did not include\nthe mathematical model of the glass in the system.\nIn fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass of water is there.\nLike before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad\nwhere I want it to be in space.\n(Applause)"
p1108
aS"\nOkay, you should be asking yourself,\nwhy doesn't the water fall out of the glass?\nTwo facts: The first is that gravity acts\non all objects in the same way.\nThe second is that the propellers are all pointing\nin the same direction of the glass, pointing up.\nYou put these two things together, the net result\nis that all side forces on the glass are small\nand are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects,\nwhich as these speeds are negligible.\nAnd that's why you don't need to model the glass.\nIt naturally doesn't spill no matter what the quad does."
p1109
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1110
aS'\nThe lesson here is that some high-performance tasks\nare easier than others,\nand that understanding the physics of the problem\ntells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard.\nIn this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy.\nBalancing a pole is hard.'
p1111
aS"\nWe've all heard stories of athletes\nperforming feats while physically injured.\nCan a machine also perform\nwith extreme physical damage?\nConventional wisdom says that you need\nat least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly,\nbecause there are four degrees of freedom to control:\nroll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.\nHexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers,\ncan provide redundancy,\nbut quadrocopters are much more popular\nbecause they have the minimum number\nof fixed motor propeller pairs: four.\nOr do they?\nIf we analyze the mathematical model of this machine\nwith only two working propellers,\nwe discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.\nWe relinquish control of yaw,\nbut roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled\nwith algorithms that exploit this new configuration.\nMathematical models tell us exactly when\nand why this is possible.\nIn this instance, this knowledge allows us to design\nnovel machine architectures\nor to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage,\njust like human athletes do,\ninstead of building machines with redundancy."
p1112
aS"\nWe can't help but hold our breath when we watch\na diver somersaulting into the water,\nor when a vaulter is twisting in the air,\nthe ground fast approaching.\nWill the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?\nWill the vaulter stick the landing?\nSuppose we want this quad here\nto perform a triple flip and finish off\nat the exact same spot that it started.\nThis maneuver is going to happen so quickly\nthat we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.\nThere simply isn't enough time.\nInstead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly,\nobserve how it finishes the maneuver,\nand then use that information to modify its behavior\nso that the next flip is better.\nSimilar to the diver and the vaulter,\nit is only through repeated practice\nthat the maneuver can be learned and executed\nto the highest standard."
p1113
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1114
aS'\nStriking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.\nHow do we make a machine do\nwhat an athlete does seemingly without effort?'
p1115
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1116
aS"\nThis quad has a racket strapped onto its head\nwith a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.\nThe following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds,\nor 50 times per second.\nWe first figure out where the ball is going.\nWe then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball\nso that it flies to where it was thrown from.\nThird, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad\nfrom its current state to the impact point with the ball.\nFourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.\nTwenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated\nuntil the quad strikes the ball."
p1117
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1118
aS'\nMachines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own,\nthey can do it collectively.\nThese three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.'
p1119
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1120
aS'\nThey perform an extremely dynamic\nand collective maneuver\nto launch the ball back to me.\nNotice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.\n(Applause)\nIn fact, when fully extended,\nthis is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels\nat the end of their launch.'
p1121
aS'\nThe algorithms to do this are very similar\nto what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.\nMathematical models are used to continuously re-plan\na cooperative strategy 50 times per second.'
p1122
aS'\nEverything we have seen so far has been\nabout the machines and their capabilities.\nWhat happens when we couple this machine athleticism\nwith that of a human being?\nWhat I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor\nmainly used in gaming.\nIt can recognize what my various body parts\nare doing in real time.\nSimilar to the pointer that I used earlier,\nwe can use this as inputs to the system.\nWe now have a natural way of interacting\nwith the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.'
p1123
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1124
aS"\nInteraction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical.\nTake this quad, for example.\nIt's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.\nIf I try to move it out of the way, it fights me,\nand moves back to where it wants to be.\nWe can change this behavior, however.\nWe can use mathematical models\nto estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.\nOnce we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics,\nas far as the quad is concerned, of course.\nHere the quad is behaving as if it were\nin a viscous fluid."
p1125
aS'\nWe now have an intimate way\nof interacting with a machine.\nI will use this new capability to position\nthis camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location\nfor filming the remainder of this demonstration.'
p1126
aS"\nSo we can physically interact with these quads\nand we can change the laws of physics.\nLet's have a little bit of fun with this.\nFor what you will see next, these quads\nwill initially behave as if they were on Pluto.\nAs time goes on, gravity will be increased\nuntil we're all back on planet Earth,\nbut I assure you we won't get there.\nOkay, here goes."

aS"\nSo I didn't always make my living from music.\nFor about the five years after graduating\nfrom an upstanding liberal arts university,\nthis was my day job.\nI was a self-employed living statue called the 8-Foot Bride,\nand I love telling people l did this for a job,\nbecause everybody always wants to know,\nwho are these freaks in real life?\nHello.\nI painted myself white one day, stood on a box,\nput a hat or a can at my feet,\nand when someone came by and dropped in money,\nI handed them a flower and some intense eye contact.\nAnd if they didn't take the flower,\nI threw in a gesture of sadness and longing\nas they walked away."
p1136
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1137
aS'\nSo I had the most profound encounters with people,\nespecially lonely people who looked\nlike they hadn\'t talked to anyone in weeks,\nand we would get this beautiful moment\nof prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street,\nand we would sort of fall in love a little bit.\nAnd my eyes would say, "Thank you. I see you."\nAnd their eyes would say,\n"Nobody ever sees me. Thank you."'
p1138
aS'\nAnd I would get harassed sometimes.\nPeople would yell at me from their passing cars.\n"Get a job!"\nAnd I\'d be, like, "This is my job."\nBut it hurt, because it made me fear\nthat I was somehow doing something un-joblike\nand unfair, shameful.\nI had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting\nfor the music business on this box.\nAnd for the economists out there,\nyou may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income,\nwhich was shocking to me\ngiven I had no regular customers,\nbut pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.\nIt was consistent.'
p1139
aS"\nAnd meanwhile, I was touring locally\nand playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls.\nThis was me on piano, a genius drummer.\nI wrote the songs, and eventually\nwe started making enough money that I could quit being a statue,\nand as we started touring,\nI really didn't want to lose this sense\nof direct connection with people, because I loved it.\nSo after all of our shows, we would sign autographs\nand hug fans and hang out and talk to people,\nand we made an art out of asking people to help us\nand join us, and I would track down local musicians\nand artists and they would set up outside of our shows,\nand they would pass the hat,\nand then they would come in and join us onstage,\nso we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests."
p1140
aS"\nAnd then Twitter came along,\nand made things even more magic, because I could ask\ninstantly for anything anywhere.\nSo I would need a piano to practice on,\nand an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London.\nPeople would bring home-cooked food to us\nall over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle.\nFans who worked in museums and stores\nand any kind of public space would wave their hands\nif I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.\nThis is a library in Auckland.\nOn Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat,\nbecause I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast,\nand they showed up care of this dude, Chris\nfrom Newport Beach, who says hello.\nI once tweeted, where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?\nAnd a nurse from a hospital drove one\nright at that moment to the cafe I was in,\nand I bought her a smoothie\nand we sat there talking about nursing and death."
p1141
aS"\nAnd I love this kind of random closeness,\nwhich is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.\nIn mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room\nbut there's no wireless, and in punk squats,\neveryone on the floor in one room with no toilets\nbut with wireless, clearly making it the better option."
p1142
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1143
aS'\nMy crew once pulled our van\nup to a really poor Miami neighborhood\nand we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night\nwas an 18-year-old girl, still living at home,\nand her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.\nAnd that night, her whole family\ntook the couches and she slept together with her mom\nso that we could take their beds.\nAnd I lay there thinking,\nthese people have so little.\nIs this fair?\nAnd in the morning, her mom taught us how\nto try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible,\nand she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English,\n"Your music has helped my daughter so much.\nThank you for staying here. We\'re all so grateful."\nAnd I thought, this is fair.\nThis is this.'
p1144
aS"\nA couple months later, I was in Manhattan,\nand I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight,\nI'm ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side,\nand it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.\nI've always been with my band or my crew.\nIs this what stupid people do? (Laughter)\nIs this how stupid people die?\nAnd before I can change my mind, the door busts open.\nShe's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters,\nand they're pouring me a glass of red wine\nand offering me a bath,\nand I have had thousands of nights like that and like that."
p1145
aS'\nSo I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.\nI maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing\nare basically the same thing.\nYou\'re falling into the audience\nand you\'re trusting each other.\nI once asked an opening band of mine\nif they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat\nto get themselves some extra money, something that I did a lot.\nAnd as usual, the band was psyched,\nbut there was this one guy in the band\nwho told me he just couldn\'t bring himself to go out there.\nIt felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.\nAnd I recognized his fear of "Is this fair?" and "Get a job."'
p1146
aS"\nAnd meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.\nWe signed with a major label.\nAnd our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.\nIt's not for everybody.\nWell, maybe it's for you.\nWe sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.\nAnd it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks,\nand the label considers this a failure."
p1147
aS'\nAnd I was like, "25,000, isn\'t that a lot?"'
p1148
aS'\nThey were like, "No, the sales are going down. It\'s a failure."\nAnd they walk off.'
p1149
aS'\nRight at this same time, I\'m signing and hugging after a gig,\nand a guy comes up to me\nand hands me a $10 bill,\nand he says,\n"I\'m sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."\n(Laughter)\n"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.\nI just want you to have this money."'
p1150
aS"\nAnd this starts happening all the time.\nI become the hat after my own gigs,\nbut I have to physically stand there and take the help from people,\nand unlike the guy in the opening band,\nI've actually had a lot of practice standing there.\nThank you."
p1151
aS"\nAnd this is the moment I decide\nI'm just going to give away my music for free\nonline whenever possible,\nso it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad;\nAmanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage\ntorrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help,\nbecause I saw it work on the street.\nSo I fought my way off my label and for my next project\nwith my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra,\nI turned to crowdfunding,\nand I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made,\nand I asked my crowd to catch me.\nAnd the goal was 100,000 dollars.\nMy fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,\nwhich was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date."
p1152
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1153
aS"\nAnd you can see how many people it is.\nIt's about 25,000 people."
p1154
aS'\nAnd the media asked, "Amanda,\nthe music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.\nHow did you make all these people pay for music?"\nAnd the real answer is, I didn\'t make them. I asked them.\nAnd through the very act of asking people,\nI\'d connected with them,\nand when you connect with them, people want to help you.\nIt\'s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.\nThey don\'t want to ask for things.\nBut it\'s not easy. It\'s not easy to ask.\nAnd a lot of artists have a problem with this.\nAsking makes you vulnerable.'
p1155
aS'\nAnd I got a lot of criticism online\nafter my Kickstarter went big\nfor continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices,\nspecifically for asking musicians\nwho are fans if they wanted to join us on stage\nfor a few songs in exchange for love and tickets\nand beer, and this was a doctored image\nthat went up of me on a website.\nAnd this hurt in a really familiar way.\nAnd people saying, "You\'re not allowed anymore\nto ask for that kind of help,"\nreally reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."\nBecause they weren\'t with us on the sidewalk,\nand they couldn\'t see the exchange\nthat was happening between me and my crowd,\nan exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.'
p1156
aS'\nSo this is slightly not safe for work.\nThis is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.\nAt the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.\nNow let me tell you, if you want to experience\nthe visceral feeling of trusting strangers,\nI recommend this,\nespecially if those strangers are drunk German people.\nThis was a ninja master-level fan connection,\nbecause what I was really saying here was,\nI trust you this much.\nShould I? Show me.'
p1157
aS"\nFor most of human history,\nmusicians, artists, they've been part of the community,\nconnectors and openers, not untouchable stars.\nCelebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance,\nbut the Internet and the content\nthat we're freely able to share on it\nare taking us back.\nIt's about a few people loving you up close\nand about those people being enough.\nSo a lot of people are confused by the idea\nof no hard sticker price.\nThey see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done,\nthe Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,\nI don't see these things as risk.\nI see them as trust.\nNow, the online tools to make the exchange\nas easy and as instinctive as the street,\nthey're getting there.\nBut the perfect tools aren't going to help us\nif we can't face each other\nand give and receive fearlessly,\nbut, more important,\nto ask without shame."
p1158
aS'\nMy music career has been spent\ntrying to encounter people on the Internet\nthe way I could on the box,\nso blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates\nand my new video but about our work and our art\nand our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes,\nand we see each other.\nAnd I think when we really see each other,\nwe want to help each other.'
p1159
aS'\nI think people have been obsessed with the wrong question,\nwhich is, "How do we make people pay for music?"\nWhat if we started asking,\n"How do we let people pay for music?"'

p1181
aS"\nLet's start with the Main Street.\nFast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.\nThe big brands are some of the most important powers,\npowerful powers, in this country.\nSupermarkets as well.\nBig companies.

French fries are considered a vegetable.\nPizza for breakfast. They don't even get given crockery.\nKnives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.\nThey have scissors in the classroom,\nbut knives and forks?

S"\nA few years ago,\nI felt like I was stuck in a rut,\nso I decided to follow in the footsteps\nof the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,\nand try something new for 30 days.\nThe idea is actually pretty simple.\nThink about something you've always wanted to add to your life\nand try it for the next 30 days.\nIt turns out,\n30 days is just about the right amount of time\nto add a new habit or subtract a habit --\nlike watching the news --\nfrom your life."
p1224
aS"\nThere's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.\nThe first was,\ninstead of the months flying by, forgotten,\nthe time was much more memorable.\nThis was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.\nAnd I remember exactly where I was\nand what I was doing that day.\nI also noticed\nthat as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges,\nmy self-confidence grew.\nI went from desk-dwelling computer nerd\nto the kind of guy who bikes to work --\nfor fun.\nEven last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro,\nthe highest mountain in Africa.\nI would never have been that adventurous\nbefore I started my 30-day challenges."
p1225
aS'\nI also figured out\nthat if you really want something badly enough,\nyou can do anything for 30 days.\nHave you ever wanted to write a novel?\nEvery November,\ntens of thousands of people\ntry to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch\nin 30 days.\nIt turns out, all you have to do\nis write 1,667 words a day\nfor a month.\nSo I did.\nBy the way, the secret is not to go to sleep\nuntil you\'ve written your words for the day.\nYou might be sleep-deprived,\nbut you\'ll finish your novel.\nNow is my book the next great American novel?\nNo. I wrote it in a month.\nIt\'s awful.\nBut for the rest of my life,\nif I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,\nI don\'t have to say,\n"I\'m a computer scientist."\nNo, no, if I want to, I can say, "I\'m a novelist."'

aS'\nBut one miracle cure we did find was yoga.\nI have to tell you, it\'s very boring,\nbut before I did yoga,\nI was a stand-up comedian who can\'t stand up.\nAnd now I can stand on my head.\nMy parents reinforced this notion\nthat I could do anything,\nthat no dream was impossible,\nand my dream was to be\non the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."\nI went to college during affirmative action\nand got a sweet scholarship to ASU,\nArizona State University,\nbecause I fit every single quota.\nI was like the pet lemur of the theater department.\nEverybody loved me.\nI did all the less-than-intelligent kids\' homework,\nI got A\'s in all of my classes,\nA\'s in all of their classes.\nEvery time I did a scene\nfrom "The Glass Menagerie,"\nmy professors would weep.\nBut I never got cast.\nFinally, my senior year,\nASU decided to do a show called\n"They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."\nIt\'s a play about a girl with C.P.\nI was a girl with C.P.\nSo I start shouting from the rooftops,\n"I\'m finally going to get a part!\nI have cerebral palsy!\nFree at last!

S'\nWhen I was 27 years old,\nI left a very demanding job in management consulting\nfor a job that was even more demanding: teaching.\nI went to teach seventh graders math\nin the New York City public schools.\nAnd like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.\nI gave out homework assignments.\nWhen the work came back, I calculated grades.'
p1257
aS"\nWhat struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference\nbetween my best and my worst students.\nSome of my strongest performers\ndid not have stratospheric I.Q. scores.\nSome of my smartest kids weren't doing so well."
p1258
aS"\nAnd that got me thinking.\nThe kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,\nsure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,\nthe area of a parallelogram.\nBut these concepts are not impossible,\nand I was firmly convinced that every one of my students\ncould learn the material\nif they worked hard and long enough."
p1259
aS'\nAfter several more years of teaching,\nI came to the conclusion that what we need in education\nis a much better understanding of students and learning\nfrom a motivational perspective,\nfrom a psychological perspective.\nIn education, the one thing we know how to measure best\nis I.Q., but what if doing well in school and in life\ndepends on much more\nthan your ability to learn quickly and easily?'
p1260
aS"\nSo I left the classroom,\nand I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.\nI started studying kids and adults\nin all kinds of super challenging settings,\nand in every study my question was,\nwho is successful here and why?\nMy research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.\nWe tried to predict which cadets\nwould stay in military training and which would drop out.\nWe went to the National Spelling Bee\nand tried to predict which children would advance\nfarthest in competition.\nWe studied rookie teachers\nworking in really tough neighborhoods, asking\nwhich teachers are still going to be here in teaching\nby the end of the school year,\nand of those, who will be the most effective\nat improving learning outcomes for their students?\nWe partnered with private companies, asking,\nwhich of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?\nAnd who's going to earn the most money?\nIn all those very different contexts,\none characteristic emerged\nas a significant predictor of success.\nAnd it wasn't social intelligence.\nIt wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.\nIt was grit."
p1261
aS"\nGrit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.\nGrit is having stamina.\nGrit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,\nnot just for the week, not just for the month,\nbut for years, and working really hard\nto make that future a reality.\nGrit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint."
p1262
aS'\nA few years ago, I started studying grit\nin the Chicago public schools.\nI asked thousands of high school juniors\nto take grit questionnaires,\nand then waited around more than a year\nto see who would graduate.\nTurns out that grittier kids\nwere significantly more likely to graduate,\neven when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,\nthings like family income,\nstandardized achievement test scores,\neven how safe kids felt when they were at school.\nSo it\'s not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee\nthat grit matters. It\'s also in school,\nespecially for kids at risk for dropping out.\nTo me, the most shocking thing about grit\nis how little we know,\nhow little science knows, about building it.\nEvery day, parents and teachers ask me,\n"How do I build grit in kids?\nWhat do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?\nHow do I keep them motivated for the long run?"\nThe honest answer is, I don\'t know. (Laughter)\nWhat I do know is that talent doesn\'t make you gritty.\nOur data show very clearly\nthat there are many talented individuals\nwho simply do not follow through on their commitments.\nIn fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated\nor even inversely related to measures of talent.'
p1263
aS'\nSo far, the best idea I\'ve heard about building grit in kids\nis something called "growth mindset."\nThis is an idea developed at Stanford University\nby Carol Dweck, and it is the belief\nthat the ability to learn is not fixed,\nthat it can change with your effort.\nDr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn\nabout the brain and how it changes and grows\nin response to challenge,\nthey\'re much more likely to persevere when they fail,\nbecause they don\'t believe that failure\nis a permanent condition.'
p1264
aS"\nSo growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.\nBut we need more.\nAnd that's where I'm going to end my remarks,\nbecause that's where we are.\nThat's the work that stands before us.\nWe need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,\nand we need to test them.\nWe need to measure whether we've been successful,\nand we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,\nto start over again with lessons learned."

S"\nSo, why does good sex so often fade,\neven for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?\nAnd why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex,\ncontrary to popular belief?\nOr, the next question would be,\ncan we want what we already have?\nThat's the million-dollar question, right?\nAnd why is the forbidden so erotic?\nWhat is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?\nAnd why does sex make babies,\nand babies spell erotic disaster in couples?\nIt's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?\nAnd when you love, how does it feel?\nAnd when you desire, how is it different?"
p1270
aS"\nThese are some of the questions\nthat are at the center of my exploration\non the nature of erotic desire\nand its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.\nSo I travel the globe,\nand what I'm noticing is that\neverywhere where romanticism has entered,\nthere seems to be a crisis of desire.\nA crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting --\ndesire as an expression of our individuality,\nof our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity --\ndesire that has become a central concept\nas part of modern love and individualistic societies."
p1271
aS"\nYou know, this is the first time in the history of humankind\nwhere we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term,\nnot because we want 14 children,\nfor which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it,\nand not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.\nThis is the first time that we want sex over time\nabout pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire."
p1272
aS"\nSo what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?\nAnd at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship,\nI think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.\nOn the one hand, our need for security, for predictability,\nfor safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence --\nall these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives\nthat we call home.\nBut we also have an equally strong need -- men and women --\nfor adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger,\nfor the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise --\nyou get the gist -- for journey, for travel.\nSo reconciling our need for security\nand our need for adventure into one relationship,\nor what we today like to call a passionate marriage,\nused to be a contradiction in terms.\nMarriage was an economic institution\nin which you were given a partnership for life\nin terms of children and social status\nand succession and companionship.\nBut now we want our partner to still give us all these things,\nbut in addition I want you to be my best friend\nand my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot,\nand we live twice as long.\n(Laughter)\nSo we come to one person, and we basically are asking them\nto give us what once an entire village used to provide:\nGive me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity,\nbut give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.\nGive me comfort, give me edge.\nGive me novelty, give me familiarity.\nGive me predictability, give me surprise.\nAnd we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.\n(Applause)"
p1273
aS"\nSo now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?\nBecause I think, in some way -- and I'll come back to that --\nbut the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination."
p1274
aS'\nSo why does good sex so often fade?\nWhat is the relationship between love and desire?\nHow do they relate, and how do they conflict?\nBecause therein lies the mystery of eroticism.'
p1275
aS'\nSo if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it\'s "to have."\nAnd if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."\nIn love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.\nWe want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap.\nWe want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness.\nBut in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we\'ve already gone.\nForgone conclusion does not keep our interest.\nIn desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit,\nthat we can go spend some time with,\nthat we can go see what goes on in their red light district.\nIn desire, we want a bridge to cross.\nOr in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.\nDesire needs space.\nAnd when it\'s said like that, it\'s often quite abstract.'
p1276
aS'\nBut then I took a question with me.\nAnd I\'ve gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years\nwith "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people,\nwhen do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?\nNot attracted sexually, per se, but most drawn.\nAnd across culture, across religion, and across gender --\nexcept for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.'
p1277
aS"\nSo the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner\nwhen she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite.\nBasically, when I get back in touch\nwith my ability to imagine myself with my partner,\nwhen my imagination comes back in the picture,\nand when I can root it in absence and in longing,\nwhich is a major component of desire.\nBut then the second group is even more interesting:\nI am most drawn to my partner\nwhen I see him in the studio, when she is onstage,\nwhen he is in his element, when she's doing something she's passionate about,\nwhen I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him,\nwhen I see her hold court.\nBasically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident,\nprobably the biggest turn-on across the board.\nRadiant, as in self-sustaining.\nI look at this person -- by the way, in desire\npeople rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one,\nfive centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is.\nBut it's also not when the other person is that far apart\nthat you no longer see them.\nIt's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance,\nwhere this person that is already so familiar, so known,\nis momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.\nAnd in this space between me and the other lies the erotic lan,\nlies that movement toward the other.\nBecause sometimes, as Proust says,\nmystery is not about traveling to new places,\nbut it's about looking with new eyes.\nAnd so, when I see my partner on his own or her own,\ndoing something in which they are enveloped,\nI look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception,\nand I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me."

aS"\nAnd then, more importantly, in this description about the other\nor myself -- it's the same -- what is most interesting\nis that there is no neediness in desire.\nNobody needs anybody.\nThere is no caretaking in desire.\nCaretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.\nI have yet to see somebody who is so turned on\nby somebody who needs them.\nWanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shutdown,\nand women have known that forever,\nbecause anything that will bring up parenthood\nwill usually decrease the erotic charge.\nFor good reasons, right?"
p1279
aS"\nAnd then the third group of answers usually would be\nwhen I'm surprised, when we laugh together,\nas somebody said to me in the office today,\nwhen he's in his tux, so I said, you know,\nit's either the tux or the cowboy boots.\nBut basically it's when there is novelty.\nBut novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques.\nNovelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?\nWhat parts of you are just being seen?\nBecause in some way one could say\nsex isn't something you do, eh?\nSex is a place you go. It's a space you enter\ninside yourself and with another, or others.\nSo where do you go in sex?\nWhat parts of you do you connect to?\nWhat do you seek to express there?\nIs it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?\nIs it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?\nIs it a place where you can finally surrender\nand not have to take responsibility for everything?\nIs it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?\nWhat comes out there? It's a language.\nIt isn't just a behavior.\nAnd it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in,\nwhich is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence."
p1280
aS"\nYou know, animals have sex.\nIt's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.\nWe are the only ones who have an erotic life,\nwhich means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.\nWe are the only ones who can make love for hours,\nhave a blissful time, multiple orgasms,\nand touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.\nWe can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.\nWe can experience that powerful thing called anticipation,\nwhich is a mortar to desire,\nthe ability to imagine it, as if it's happening,\nto experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening\nand everything is happening at the same time.\nSo when I began to think about eroticism,\nI began to think about the poetics of sex,\nand if I look at it as an intelligence,\nthen it's something that you cultivate.\nWhat are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness,\nnovelty, curiosity, mystery.\nBut the central agent is really that piece called the imagination."
p1281
aS'\nBut more importantly, for me to begin to understand\nwho are the couples who have an erotic spark,\nwhat sustains desire, I had to go back\nto the original definition of eroticism,\nthe mystical definition, and I went through it\nthrough a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma,\nwhich is the other side, and I looked at it\nlooking at the community that I had grown up in,\nwhich was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors,\nand in my community there were two groups:\nthose who didn\'t die, and those who came back to life.\nAnd those who didn\'t die lived often very tethered to the ground,\ncould not experience pleasure, could not trust,\nbecause when you\'re vigilant, worried, anxious,\nand insecure, you can\'t lift your head\nto go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative.\nThose who came back to life were those\nwho understood the erotic as an antidote to death.\nThey knew how to keep themselves alive.\nAnd when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with,\nI sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex,"\nbut generally people want better sex,\nand better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness,\nof vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of eros, of energy\nthat sex used to afford them, or that they\'ve hoped\nit would afford them.'
p1282
aS'\nAnd so I began to ask a different question.\n"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.\n"I turn off my desires when ..." which is not the same question as,\n"What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."\nAnd people began to say, "I turn myself off when\nI feel dead inside, when I don\'t like my body,\nwhen I feel old, when I haven\'t had time for myself,\nwhen I haven\'t had a chance to even check in with you,\nwhen I don\'t perform well at work,\nwhen I feel low self esteem, when I don\'t have a sense of self-worth,\nwhen I don\'t feel like I have a right to want, to take,\nto receive pleasure."'
p1283
aS'\nAnd then I began to ask the reverse question.\n"I turn myself on when ..." Because most of the time,\npeople like to ask the question, "You turn me on,\nwhat turns me on," and I\'m out of the question. You know?\nNow, if you are dead inside, the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine\'s.\nIt won\'t make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.\n(Laughter)\nSo I turn myself on when,\nI turn my desires, I wake up when ...'
p1284
aS"\nNow, in this paradox between love and desire,\nwhat seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients\nthat nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity,\nprotection, worry, responsibility for the other --\nare sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.\nBecause desire comes with a host of feelings\nthat are not always such favorites of love:\njealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance,\nnaughtiness, mischief.\nBasically most of us will get turned on at night\nby the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day.\nYou know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.\nIf everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses,\nwe wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.\nBut no, in our mind up there\nare a host of things going on that we don't always know\nhow to bring to the person that we love,\nbecause we think love comes with selflessness\nand in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness\nin the best sense of the word:\nthe ability to stay connected to one's self\nin the presence of another."
p1285
aS'\nSo I want to draw that little image for you,\nbecause this need to reconcile these two sets of needs,\nwe are born with that.\nOur need for connection, our need for separateness,\nor our need for security and adventure,\nor our need for togetherness and for autonomy,\nand if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap\nand who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable,\nand at some point all of us need to go out into the world\nto discover and to explore.\nThat\'s the beginning of desire,\nthat exploratory needs curiosity, discovery.\nAnd then at some point they turn around and they look at you,\nand if you tell them,\n"Hey kiddo, the world\'s a great place. Go for it.\nThere\'s so much fun out there,"\nthen they can turn away and they can experience\nconnection and separateness at the same time.\nThey can go off in their imagination, off in their body,\noff in their playfulness, all the while knowing\nthat there\'s somebody when they come back.'
p1286
aS'\nBut if on this side there is somebody who says,\n"I\'m worried. I\'m anxious. I\'m depressed.\nMy partner hasn\'t taken care of me in so long.\nWhat\'s so good out there? Don\'t we have everything\nyou need together, you and I?"\nthen there are a few little reactions\nthat all of us can pretty much recognize.\nSome of us will come back, came back a long time ago,\nand that little child who comes back\nis the child who will forgo a part of himself\nin order not to lose the other.\nI will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.\nAnd I will learn to love in a certain way\nthat will become burdened with extra worry\nand extra responsibility and extra protection,\nand I won\'t know how to leave you\nin order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure,\nin order to discover, to enter inside myself.\nTranslate this into adult language.\nIt starts very young. It continues into our sex lives\nup to the end.\nChild number two comes back\nbut looks like that over their shoulder all the time.\n"Are you going to be there?\nAre you going to curse me? Are you going to scold me?\nAre you going to be angry with me?"\nAnd they may be gone, but they\'re never really away,\nand those are often the people that will tell you,\nin the beginning it was super hot.\nBecause in the beginning, the growing intimacy\nwasn\'t yet so strong\nthat it actually led to the decrease of desire.\nThe more connected I became, the more responsible I felt,\nthe less I was able to let go in your presence.\nThe third child doesn\'t really come back.'
p1287
aS"\nSo what happens, if you want to sustain desire,\nit's that real dialectic piece.\nOn the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.\nOn the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure,\nyou can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm,\nyou don't get excited because you spend your time\nin the body and the head of the other and not in your own."
p1288
aS"\nSo in this dilemma about reconciling\nthese two sets of fundamental needs,\nthere are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.\nOne, they have a lot of sexual privacy.\nThey understand that there is an erotic space\nthat belongs to each of them.\nThey also understand that foreplay is not something you do\nfive minutes before the real thing.\nForeplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.\nThey also understand that an erotic space\nisn't about, you begin to stroke the other.\nIt's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.,\nmaybe where you leave the agile program,\n(Laughter)\nand you actually just enter that place\nwhere you stop being the good citizen\nwho is taking care of things and being responsible.\nResponsibility and desire just butt heads.\nThey don't really do well together.\nErotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.\nIt's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.\nBut what they know is they know how to resurrect it.\nThey know how to bring it back,\nand they know how to bring it back\nbecause they have demystified one big myth,\nwhich is the myth of spontaneity, which is\nthat it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry\nlike a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood\nthat whatever is going to just happen\nin a long-term relationship already has."

p1311
aS"\nYves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun.\n(Laughter)\nI don't have feathers.\nBut I feel like a bird sometimes.\nIt's really an unreal feeling,\nbecause normally you have a big thing,\na plane, around you.\nAnd when I strap just these little harnesses,\nthis little wing,\nI really have the feeling of being a bird."
p1312
aS'\nBG: How did you start to become Jetman?'
p1313
aS"\nYR: It was about 20 years ago\nwhen I discovered free falling.\nWhen you go out of an airplane\nyou are almost naked.\nYou take a position like that.\nAnd especially when you take a tracking position,\nyou have the feeling\nthat you are flying.\nAnd that's the nearest thing to the dream.\nYou have no machine around you.\nYou are just in the element.\nIt's very short and only in one direction.\nSo the idea\nwas, okay, keep that feeling of freedom,\nbut change the vector and increase the time."
p1314
aS"\nBG: So I'm kind of curious, what's your top speed?"
p1315
aS"\nYR: It's about 300 km per hour before looping.\nThat means about 190 miles per hour."
p1316
aS"\nBG: And what's the weight of the equipment you're carrying?"

aS"\nYR: When I exit full of kerosene,\nI'm about 55 kilos.\nI have 55 kilos on my back."
p1318
aS"\nBG: And you're not piloting?\nThere is no handle, no steering nothing?\nIt is purely your body,\nand the wings become part of the body and vice versa?"
p1319
aS"\nYR: That's really the goal,\nbecause if you put [in] steering,\nthen you reinvent the airplane.\nAnd I wanted to keep this freedom of movement.\nAnd it's really like the kid playing the airplane.\nI want to go down like that.\nAnd up I climb, I turn.\nIt's really pure flying.\nIt's not steering, it's flight."
p1320
aS'\nBG: What kind of training do you do,\nyou personally, for that?'
p1321
aS"\nYR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.\nI don't do special physical training.\nJust, I try to keep my mobility\nthrough new activities.\nFor example,\nlast winter I began with kite surfing --\nso new things.\nSo you have to adapt.\nBecause this is -- I'm quite an experienced manager of systems\nas a pilot,\nbut this is really --\nyou need fluidity,\nyou need to be agile\nand also to adapt really fast."
p1322
aS'\nBG: Somebody in the audience asked me,\n"How does he breathe up there?"\nbecause you\'re going fast and you\'re up 3,000 meters or so.'
p1323
aS"\nYR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,\nit's not such a big problem with oxygen.\nBut for example, bikers,\nthey have the same speed.\nJust with the helmet, integral helmet,\nit's really no problem to breathe."
p1324
aS"\nBG: Describe for me the equipment since you have it here.\nSo Breitling's four engines."
p1325
aS"\nYR: Yeah, two-meter span.\nUltrastable profile.\nFour little engines,\n22 kilos thrust each, turbines\nworking with kerosene.\nHarness, parachute.\nMy only instruments are [an] altimeter and time.\nI know I have about eight minutes fuel.\nSo just check before it's finished.\n(Laughter)\nAnd yeah, that's all.\nTwo parachutes.\nThat means, if I have a problem\nwith the first one I pull,\nI still have the possibility\nto open the second one.\nAnd this is my life.\nThat's the real important thing about safety.\nI did use that\nduring these last 15 years\nabout 20 times --\nnever with that type of wing, but at the beginning.\nI can release my wing\nwhen I am in a spin or unstable."
p1326
aS'\nBG: We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait\nwhere you lost control\nand then you dived down into the clouds\nand in the ocean.\nSo that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right?'
p1327
aS'\nYR: Yeah. I did try in [the] clouds,\nbut you lose [orientation completely].\nSo I did try to take, again,\na climb altitude.\nI thought, okay, I will go out.\nBut most probably I did something like that.'
p1328
aS'\nBG: Something that is not very safe in image.'
p1329
aS'\nYR: But you feel great,\nbut you have not the right altitude.\nSo the next thing I saw was just blue.\nIt was the sea.\nI have also an audible altimeter.\nSo I was at my minimum altitude\nin that vector -- fast --\nso I pulled that.\nAnd then I did open my chute.'
p1330
aS'\nBG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.'
p1331
aS'\nYR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing\nfor two reasons:\nso I can repair it afterward\nand especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.'
p1332
aS"\nBG: I see. Maybe come back here.\nThis is risky stuff indeed.\nPeople have died trying to do this kind of thing.\nAnd you don't look like a crazy guy; you're a Swiss airline pilot,\nso you're rather a checklist kind of guy.\nI assume you have standards."
p1333
aS'\nYR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.'
p1334
aS"\nBG: Let's not tell you employer."
p1335
aS"\nYR: No, that's really two worlds.\nCivil aviation is something that we know very well.\nWe have a hundred years of experience.\nAnd you can adapt really precisely.\nWith that,\nI have to adapt to something new.\nThat means improvise.\nSo it's really a play between these two approaches.\nSomething that I know very well --\nthese principles, for example,\nwe have two engines on an Airbus;\nwith only one engine, you can fly it.\nSo plan B, always a plan B.\nIn a fighter, you have an ejection seat.\nThat's my ejection seat.\nSo I have the approach of a professional pilot\nwith the respect of a pioneer\nin front of Mother Nature."
p1336
aS"\nBG: It's well said. It's well said.\nWhat happens if one of the engines stops?"
p1337
aS"\nYR: I do a roll.\nAnd then I stabilize,\nand according to my altitude,\nI continue on two or three engines.\nIt's sometimes possible --\nit's quite complicated to explain --\nbut according to which regime I was,\nI can continue on two\nand try to get a nice place to land, and then I open my parachute."
p1338
aS'\nBG: So the beginning of the flight\nis actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter,\nand you go on a dive and accelerate the engines,\nand then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.\nAnd then the landing, as we have seen,\narriving on this side of the channel,\nis through a parachute.\nSo just as a curiosity,\nwhere did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon?\nDid you land on the rim, down at the bottom?'
p1339
aS'\nYR: It was down on the bottom.\nAnd I came back afterward\non the sled of the helicopter back.\nBut it was too stoney and full of cactus on top.'
p1340
aS"\nBG: That's exactly why I asked the question."
p1341
aS'\nYR: And also the currents are quite funny there.\nThere is big thermal activity,\nbig difference in altitude also.\nSo it was much safer for me to land at the bottom.'
p1342
aS'\nBG: So I think that right now, many people in the audience\nare asking, "Okay, when are you developing a double-seater\nso they can fly with you?"'
p1343
aS'\nYR: I have a standard answer.\nHave you ever seen tandem birds?'
p1344
aS"\nBG: Perfect answer.\n(Applause)\nYves, one last question.\nWhat's next for you? What's next for Jetman?"
p1345
aS'\nYR: First, to instruct a younger guy.\nI want to share it,\nto do formation flights.\nAnd I plan to start from a cliff,\nlike catapulted from a cliff.'
p1346
aS'\nBG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?'
p1347
aS"\nYR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,\nbut with initial speed.\nReally, I go step by step.\nIt seems a little bit crazy,\nbut it's not.\nIt's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous.\n(Laughter)\nThanks to the increasing technology, better technology,\nit will be safe.\nAnd I hope it will be for everybody."

p1350
aa(lp1351
S'\nIt is a dream of mankind\nto fly like a bird.\nBirds are very agile.\nThey fly, not with rotating components,\nso they fly only by flapping their wings.\nSo we looked at the birds,\nand we tried to make a model\nthat is powerful, ultralight,\nand it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities\nthat would fly by its own\nand only by flapping its wings.'
p1352
aS'\nSo what would be better [than] to use\nthe Herring Gull, in its freedom,\ncircling and swooping over the sea,\nand [to] use this as a role model?\nSo we bring a team together.\nThere are generalists and also specialists\nin the field of aerodynamics\nin the field of building gliders.\nAnd the task was to build\nan ultralight indoor-flying model\nthat is able to fly over your heads.\nSo be careful later on.\nAnd this was one issue:\nto build it that lightweight\nthat no one would be hurt\nif it fell down.'
p1353
aS"\nSo why do we do all this?\nWe are a company in the field of automation,\nand we'd like to do very lightweight structures\nbecause that's energy efficient,\nand we'd like to learn more about\npneumatics and air flow phenomena."
p1354
aS"\nSo I now would like you\nto [put] your seat belts on\nand put your hats [on].\nSo maybe we'll try it once --\nto fly a SmartBird.\nThank you."
p1355
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1356
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1357
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1358
aS'\nSo we can now\nlook at the SmartBird.\nSo here is one without a skin.\nWe have a wingspan of about two meters.\nThe length is one meter and six,\nand the weight,\nit is only 450 grams.\nAnd it is all out of carbon fiber.\nIn the middle we have a motor,\nand we also have a gear in it,\nand we use the gear\nto transfer the circulation of the motor.\nSo within the motor, we have three Hall sensors,\nso we know exactly where\nthe wing is.\nAnd if we now beat up and down ...\nwe have the possibility\nto fly like a bird.\nSo if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,\nand if you go up,\nthe wings are not that large,\nand it is easier to get up.'
p1359
aS'\nSo, the next thing we did,\nor the challenges we did,\nwas to coordinate this movement.\nWe have to turn it, go up and go down.\nWe have a split wing.\nWith a split wing\nwe get the lift at the upper wing,\nand we get the propulsion at the lower wing.\nAlso, we see\nhow we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.\nWe had knowledge about\nthe electromechanical efficiency\nand then we can calculate\nthe aerodynamic efficiency.\nSo therefore,\nit rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,\nfrom 30 percent\nup to 80 percent.'
p1360
aS'\nNext thing we have to do,\nwe have to control and regulate\nthe whole structure.\nOnly if you control and regulate it,\nyou will get that aerodynamic efficiency.\nSo the overall consumption of energy\nis about 25 watts at takeoff\nand 16 to 18 watts in flight.\nThank you.'

aS'\nOne of the real challenges\nis to innovate fundamentally\nin education.\nInnovation is hard\nbecause it means doing something\nthat people don\'t find very easy, for the most part.\nIt means challenging what we take for granted,\nthings that we think are obvious.\nThe great problem for reform\nor transformation\nis the tyranny of common sense;\nthings that people think,\n"Well, it can\'t be done any other way because that\'s the way it\'s done."'
p1388
aS"\nI came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln,\nwho I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.\n(Laughter)\nHe said this in December 1862\nto the second annual meeting of Congress.\nI ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.\nWe don't teach American history in Britain.\n(Laughter)\nWe suppress it. You know, this is our policy.\n(Laughter)\nSo, no doubt, something fascinating was happening in December 1862,\nwhich the Americans among us\nwill be aware of."
p1389
aS'\nBut he said this:\n"The dogmas\nof the quiet past\nare inadequate to the stormy present.\nThe occasion\nis piled high with difficulty,\nand we must rise with the occasion."\nI love that.\nNot rise to it, rise with it.\n"As our case is new,\nso we must think anew\nand act anew.\nWe must disenthrall ourselves,\nand then we shall save our country."'
p1390
aS'\nI love that word, "disenthrall."\nYou know what it means?\nThat there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to,\nwhich we simply take for granted\nas the natural order of things, the way things are.\nAnd many of our ideas\nhave been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century,\nbut to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.\nBut our minds are still hypnotized by them,\nand we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.\nNow, doing this is easier said than done.\nIt\'s very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted. (Laughter)\nAnd the reason is that you take it for granted.'
p1391
aS'\nSo let me ask you something you may take for granted.\nHow many of you here are over the age of 25?\nThat\'s not what I think you take for granted,\nI\'m sure you\'re familiar with that already.\nAre there any people here under the age of 25?\nGreat. Now, those over 25,\ncould you put your hands up if you\'re wearing your wristwatch?\nNow that\'s a great deal of us, isn\'t it?\nAsk a room full of teenagers the same thing.\nTeenagers do not wear wristwatches.\nI don\'t mean they can\'t or they\'re not allowed to,\nthey just often choose not to.\nAnd the reason is, you see, that we were brought up\nin a pre-digital culture, those of us over 25.\nAnd so for us, if you want to know the time\nyou have to wear something to tell it.\nKids now live in a world which is digitized,\nand the time, for them, is everywhere.\nThey see no reason to do this.\nAnd by the way, you don\'t need to do it either;\nit\'s just that you\'ve always done it and you carry on doing it.\nMy daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who\'s 20.\nShe doesn\'t see the point.\nAs she says, "It\'s a single function device."\n(Laughter)\n"Like, how lame is that?"\nAnd I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."\n(Laughter)\n"It has multiple functions."'
p1392
aS"\nBut, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.\nLet me give you a couple of examples.\nOne of them is the idea of linearity:\nthat it starts here and you go through a track\nand if you do everything right, you will end up\nset for the rest of your life.\nEverybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly,\nor sometimes explicitly, a different story:\nthat life is not linear; it's organic.\nWe create our lives symbiotically\nas we explore our talents\nin relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.\nBut, you know, we have become obsessed\nwith this linear narrative.\nAnd probably the pinnacle for education\nis getting you to college.\nI think we are obsessed with getting people to college.\nCertain sorts of college.\nI don't mean you shouldn't go to college, but not everybody needs to go\nand not everybody needs to go now.\nMaybe they go later, not right away."
p1393
aS'\nAnd I was up in San Francisco a while ago\ndoing a book signing.\nThere was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.\nAnd I said, "What do you do?"\nAnd he said, "I\'m a fireman."\nAnd I said, "How long have you been a fireman?"\nHe said, "Always. I\'ve always been a fireman."\nAnd I said, "Well, when did you decide?"\nHe said, "As a kid." He said, "Actually, it was a problem for me at school,\nbecause at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."\nHe said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."\nAnd he said, "When I got to the senior year of school,\nmy teachers didn\'t take it seriously.\nThis one teacher didn\'t take it seriously.\nHe said I was throwing my life away\nif that\'s all I chose to do with it;\nthat I should go to college, I should become a professional person,\nthat I had great potential\nand I was wasting my talent to do that."\nAnd he said, "It was humiliating because\nhe said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful.\nBut it\'s what I wanted, and as soon as I left school,\nI applied to the fire service and I was accepted."\nAnd he said, "You know, I was thinking about that guy recently,\njust a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher,"\nhe said, "because six months ago,\nI saved his life."\n(Laughter)\nHe said, "He was in a car wreck,\nand I pulled him out, gave him CPR,\nand I saved his wife\'s life as well."\nHe said, "I think he thinks better of me now."'
p1394
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1395
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1396
aS'\nYou know, to me,\nhuman communities depend upon\na diversity of talent,\nnot a singular conception of ability.\nAnd at the heart of our challenges --\n(Applause)\nAt the heart of the challenge\nis to reconstitute our sense of ability\nand of intelligence.\nThis linearity thing is a problem.'
p1397
aS'\nWhen I arrived in L.A.\nabout nine years ago,\nI came across a policy statement --\nvery well-intentioned --\nwhich said, "College begins in kindergarten."\nNo, it doesn\'t.\n(Laughter)\nIt doesn\'t.\nIf we had time, I could go into this, but we don\'t.\n(Laughter)\nKindergarten begins in kindergarten.\n(Laughter)\nA friend of mine once said,\n"You know, a three year-old is not half a six year-old."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nThey\'re three.'
p1398
aS'\nBut as we just heard in this last session,\nthere\'s such competition now to get into kindergarten --\nto get to the right kindergarten --\nthat people are being interviewed for it at three.\nKids sitting in front of unimpressed panels,\nyou know, with their resumes,\n(Laughter)\nflipping through and saying, "Well, this is it?"\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\n"You\'ve been around for 36 months, and this is it?"\n(Laughter)\n"You\'ve achieved nothing -- commit.\nSpent the first six months breastfeeding, the way I can see it."\n(Laughter)\nSee, it\'s outrageous as a conception, but it [unclear].'
p1399
aS"\nThe other big issue is conformity.\nWe have built our education systems\non the model of fast food.\nThis is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.\nYou know there are two models of quality assurance in catering.\nOne is fast food,\nwhere everything is standardized.\nThe other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants,\nwhere everything is not standardized,\nthey're customized to local circumstances.\nAnd we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education,\nand it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies\nas much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies."
p1400
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1401
aS"\nI think we have to recognize a couple of things here.\nOne is that human talent is tremendously diverse.\nPeople have very different aptitudes.\nI worked out recently that\nI was given a guitar as a kid\nat about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.\nYou know, it worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying.\n(Laughter)\nIn a way, it did not for me.\nI could not get this thing to work\nno matter how often or how hard I blew into it.\n(Laughter) It just wouldn't work."
p1402
aS"\nBut it's not only about that.\nIt's about passion.\nOften, people are good at things they don't really care for.\nIt's about passion,\nand what excites our spirit and our energy.\nAnd if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,\ntime takes a different course entirely.\nMy wife's just finished writing a novel,\nand I think it's a great book,\nbut she disappears for hours on end.\nYou know this, if you're doing something you love,\nan hour feels like five minutes.\nIf you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit,\nfive minutes feels like an hour.\nAnd the reason so many people are opting out of education\nis because it doesn't feed their spirit,\nit doesn't feed their energy or their passion."
p1403
aS"\nSo I think we have to change metaphors.\nWe have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education,\na manufacturing model,\nwhich is based on linearity\nand conformity and batching people.\nWe have to move to a model\nthat is based more on principles of agriculture.\nWe have to recognize that human flourishing\nis not a mechanical process;\nit's an organic process.\nAnd you cannot predict the outcome of human development.\nAll you can do, like a farmer,\nis create the conditions under which\nthey will begin to flourish."
p1404
aS"\nSo when we look at reforming education and transforming it,\nit isn't like cloning a system.\nThere are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.\nThere are many great models.\nIt's about customizing to your circumstances\nand personalizing education\nto the people you're actually teaching.\nAnd doing that, I think,\nis the answer to the future\nbecause it's not about scaling a new solution;\nit's about creating a movement in education\nin which people develop their own solutions,\nbut with external support based on a personalized curriculum."
p1405
aS"\nNow in this room,\nthere are people who represent\nextraordinary resources in business,\nin multimedia, in the Internet.\nThese technologies,\ncombined with the extraordinary talents of teachers,\nprovide an opportunity to revolutionize education.\nAnd I urge you to get involved in it\nbecause it's vital, not just to ourselves,\nbut to the future of our children.\nBut we have to change from the industrial model\nto an agricultural model,\nwhere each school can be flourishing tomorrow.\nThat's where children experience life.\nOr at home, if that's where they choose to be educated\nwith their families or their friends."
p1406
aS'\nThere\'s been a lot of talk about dreams\nover the course of this few days.\nAnd I wanted to just very quickly ...\nI was very struck by Natalie Merchant\'s songs last night,\nrecovering old poems.\nI wanted to read you a quick, very short poem\nfrom W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know.\nHe wrote this to his love,\nMaud Gonne,\nand he was bewailing the fact that\nhe couldn\'t really give her what he thought she wanted from him.\nAnd he says, "I\'ve got something else, but it may not be for you."'
p1407
aS'\nHe says this:\n"Had I the heavens\' embroidered cloths,\nEnwrought with gold\nand silver light,\nThe blue and the dim\nand the dark cloths\nOf night and light and the half-light,\nI would spread the cloths under your feet:\nBut I, being poor,\nhave only my dreams;\nI have spread my dreams under your feet;\nTread softly\nbecause you tread on my dreams."\nAnd every day, everywhere,\nour children spread their dreams beneath our feet.\nAnd we should tread softly.'

S'\n[Non English]\n... and that\'s one of the things that I enjoy most\nabout this convention.\nIt\'s not so much, as so little as to do with what everything is.\n(Laughter)\nBut it is within our self-interest\nto understand the topography of our lives\nunto ourselves.\n(Laughter)\nThe future states\nthat there is no time\nother than the collapsation of that sensation\nof the mirror of the memories in which we are living.\n(Laughter)\nCommon knowledge,\nbut important nonetheless.\n(Laughter)\nAs we face fear in these times,\nand fear is all around us,\nwe also have anti-fear.\nIt\'s hard to imagine or measure.\nThe background radiation is simply too static\nto be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.\nBut we feel as though there are times\nwhen a lot of us -- you know what I\'m say\'n?\nBut -- you know what I\'m say\'n?\nCuz, like, as a hip hop thing, you know what I\'m say\'n,\nTED be rock\'n -- you know what I\'m say\'n.\nLike so I wrote a song,\nand I hope you guys dig it.\nIt\'s a song about people\nand sasquatches --\n(Laughter)\n-- and other French science stuff.\nThat\'s French science.\nOkay, here we go.\n I\'ve been trying inside \n I know that I\'m in trouble by myself \n But every time it gets me \n [unclear] \n(Music)\n And I\'ve been trying to be the one that you believe in \n And you\'re the one that I want to be so saucy \n And you\'re the one I want to [unclear], baby \n And you can do anything \n as long as you don\'t get hurt along the way back \n If I survive, I\'m gonna tell you what is wrong \n Because if you were [unclear] \n And I think that you\'re looking like a [unclear] \n I give you what I want to be \n(Music)\nAnd it\'s like, you could use as many of those things that you want.\n(Applause)\nAnd the computer models,\nno matter how many that you have\nand how many people that you use,\nare never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions.\nFour years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute,\nand I arrived at a conclusion.\n(Laughter)\nTomorrow is another day.\n(Laughter)\nNot just any day,\nbut it is a day.\nIt will get here, there\'s no question.\nAnd the important thing to remember\nis that this simulation is a good one.\nIt\'s believable, it\'s tactile.\nYou can reach out -- things are solid.\nYou can move objects from one area to another.\nYou can feel your body.\nYou can say, "I\'d like to go over to this location,"\nand you can move this mass of molecules through the air\nover to another location at will.\n(Laughter)\nThat\'s something you live inside of every day.\nNow with the allocation and the understanding of\nthe lack of understanding,\nwe enter into a new era of science\nin which we feel nothing more\nthan so much so as to say\nthat those within themselves,\ncomporary or non-comporary,\nwill figuratively figure\ninto the folding of our non-understanding\nand our partial understanding\nto the networks of which we all draw our source\nand conclusions from.\n(Laughter)\nSo, as I say before the last piece,\nfeel not as though it is a sphere we live on,\nrather an infinite plane which has the illusion\nof leading yourself back to the point of origin.\n(Laughter)\nOnce we understand that all the spheres in the sky\nare just large infinite planes,\nit will be plain to see. Ha Ha Ha.\nThis is my final piece.\nAnd just remember\neverything you are --\nit\'s more important to realize\nthe negative space,\nas music is only the division of space;\nit is the space we are listening to divided as such,\nwhich gives us the information\ncomparison to something other\nthat gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted\nwants to be.\nSo please, without further ado.\n(Applause)\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nThis is a fun one.\nIt goes like this.\n(Music)\nOkay, for the last piece I\'d like to do,\nthis one goes very similar to this.\nI hope you guys recognize it.\nHere we go.\nOkay, that still works.

S'\nImagine a big explosion\nas you climb through 3,000 ft.\nImagine a plane full of smoke.\nImagine an engine going clack, clack, clack,\nclack, clack, clack, clack.\nIt sounds scary.\nWell I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D.\nI was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.\nSo I looked at them right away,\nand they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."\nThe pilot had already turned the plane around,\nand we weren\'t that far.\nYou could see Manhattan.\nTwo minutes later,\nthree things happened at the same time.\nThe pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.\nThat\'s usually not the route.\n(Laughter)\nHe turns off the engines.\nNow imagine being in a plane with no sound.\nAnd then he says three words --\nthe most unemotional three words I\'ve ever heard.\nHe says, "Brace for impact."\nI didn\'t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.\n(Laughter)\nI could see in her eyes,\nit was terror. Life was over.'
p1415
aS'\nNow I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.\nI learned that it all changes in an instant.\nWe have this bucket list,\nwe have these things we want to do in life,\nand I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn\'t,\nall the fences I wanted to mend,\nall the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.\nAs I thought about that later on,\nI came up with a saying,\nwhich is, "I collect bad wines."\nBecause if the wine is ready and the person is there, I\'m opening it.\nI no longer want to postpone anything in life.\nAnd that urgency, that purpose,\nhas really changed my life.'
p1416
aS"\nThe second thing I learned that day --\nand this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,\nwhich was by not a lot --\nI thought about, wow,\nI really feel one real regret.\nI've lived a good life.\nIn my own humanity and mistakes,\nI've tried to get better at everything I tried.\nBut in my humanity,\nI also allow my ego to get in.\nAnd I regretted the time I wasted\non things that did not matter\nwith people that matter.\nAnd I thought about my relationship with my wife,\nwith my friends, with people.\nAnd after, as I reflected on that,\nI decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.\nIt's not perfect, but it's a lot better.\nI've not had a fight with my wife in two years.\nIt feels great.\nI no longer try to be right;\nI choose to be happy."
p1417
aS'\nThe third thing I learned --\nand this is as your mental clock\nstarts going, "15, 14, 13."\nYou can see the water coming.\nI\'m saying, "Please blow up."\nI don\'t want this thing to break in 20 pieces\nlike you\'ve seen in those documentaries.\nAnd as we\'re coming down,\nI had a sense of, wow,\ndying is not scary.\nIt\'s almost like we\'ve been preparing for it our whole lives.\nBut it was very sad.\nI didn\'t want to go; I love my life.\nAnd that sadness\nreally framed in one thought,\nwhich is, I only wish for one thing.\nI only wish I could see my kids grow up.\nAbout a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --\nfirst-grader, not much artistic talent ...\n... yet.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I\'m bawling, I\'m crying,\nlike a little kid.\nAnd it made all the sense in the world to me.\nI realized at that point,\nby connecting those two dots,\nthat the only thing that matters in my life\nis being a great dad.\nAbove all, above all,\nthe only goal I have in life\nis to be a good dad.'
p1418
aS"\nI was given the gift of a miracle,\nof not dying that day.\nI was given another gift,\nwhich was to be able to see into the future\nand come back\nand live differently.\nI challenge you guys that are flying today,\nimagine the same thing happens on your plane --\nand please don't --\nbut imagine, and how would you change?\nWhat would you get done that you're waiting to get done\nbecause you think you'll be here forever?\nHow would you change your relationships\nand the negative energy in them?\nAnd more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?"

S'\nI think I was supposed to talk about my new book,\nwhich is called "Blink," and it\'s about snap judgments and first impressions.\nAnd it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.\nBut I was thinking about this,\nand I realized that although my new book makes me happy,\nand I think would make my mother happy,\nit\'s not really about happiness.\nSo I decided instead, I would talk about someone who\nI think has done as much to make Americans happy\nas perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,\na man who is a great personal hero of mine:\nsomeone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,\nwho is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.'
p1423
aS"\nHoward's about this high, and he's round,\nand he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses\nand thinning grey hair, and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,\nand he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,\nand he's a great aficionado of medieval history.\nAnd by profession, he's a psychophysicist.\nNow, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,\nalthough at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting\nher doctorate in psychophysics.\nWhich should tell you something about that relationship. (Laughter)"
p1424
aS'\nAs far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.\nAnd Howard is very interested in measuring things.\nAnd he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,\nand he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.\nAnd one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago, back in the early \'70s\n-- one of his first clients was Pepsi.\nAnd Pepsi came to Howard and they said,\n"You know, there\'s this new thing called aspartame,\nand we would like to make Diet Pepsi.\nWe\'d like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in\neach can of Diet Pepsi, in order to have the perfect drink." Right?\nNow that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,\nand that\'s what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him,\n"Look, we\'re working with a band between eight and 12 percent.\nAnything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;\nanything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.\nWe want to know: what\'s the sweet spot between eight and 12?"\nNow, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it\'s very simple.\nWhat we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,\nat every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,\nall the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people,\nand we plot the results on a curve,\nand we take the most popular concentration. Right? Really simple.'
p1425
aS"\nHoward does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve,\nand all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.\nIn fact, the data doesn't make any sense.\nIt's a mess. It's all over the place.\nNow, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,\nare not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.\nThey think, well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.\nYou know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.\nYou know, let's just make an educated guess,\nand they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle.\nHoward is not so easily placated.\nHoward is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.\nAnd this was not good enough for him,\nand this question bedeviled him for years.\nAnd he would think it through and say, what was wrong?\nWhy could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"
p1426
aS'\nAnd one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,\nabout to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafe.\nAnd suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.\nAnd that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,\nthey were asking the wrong question.\nThey were looking for the perfect Pepsi,\nand they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me.\nThis was an enormous revelation.\nThis was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.\nAnd Howard immediately went on the road,\nand he would go to conferences around the country,\nand he would stand up and he would say,\n"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You\'re wrong.\nYou should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."\nAnd people would look at him with a blank look, and they would say,\n"What are you talking about? This is craziness."\nAnd they would say, you know, "Move! Next!"\nTried to get business, nobody would hire him -- he was obsessed, though,\nand he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it.\nHoward loves the Yiddish expression\n"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."\nThis was his horseradish. (Laughter) He was obsessed with it!'
p1427
aS'\nAnd finally, he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him,\nand they said, "Mr. Moskowitz -- Doctor Moskowitz --\nwe want to make the perfect pickle." And he said,\n"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."\nAnd he came back to them and he said, "You don\'t just need to improve your regular;\nyou need to create zesty."\nAnd that\'s where we got zesty pickles.\nThen the next person came to him, and that was Campbell\'s Soup.\nAnd this was even more important. In fact,\nCampbell\'s Soup is where Howard made his reputation.\nCampbell\'s made Prego, and Prego, in the early \'80s, was struggling next to Ragu,\nwhich was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the \'70s and \'80s.\nNow in the industry -- I don\'t know whether you care about this,\nor how much time I have to go into this.\nBut it was, technically speaking -- this is an aside --\nPrego is a better tomato sauce than Ragu.\nThe quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior;\nit adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact,\nthey would do the famous bowl test back in the \'70s with Ragu and Prego.\nYou\'d have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?\nAnd the Ragu would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.\nThat\'s called "adherence."\nAnd, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,\nand the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling.'
p1428
aS"\nSo they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.\nAnd Howard looked at their product line, and he said,\nwhat you have is a dead tomato society.\nSo he said, this is what I want to do.\nAnd he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,\nand he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them\naccording to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce:\nby sweetness, by level of garlic, by tartness, by sourness, by tomatoey-ness,\nby visible solids -- my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. (Laughter)\nEvery conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce.\nAnd then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road.\nHe went to New York; he went to Chicago; he went to Jacksonville;\nhe went to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload. Into big halls.\nAnd he sat them down for two hours, and he gave them,\nover the course of that two hours, ten bowls.\nTen small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.\nAnd after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,\nhow good they thought the spaghetti sauce was."
p1429
aS"\nAt the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,\nhe had a mountain of data\nabout how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.\nAnd then he analyzed the data.\nNow, did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce? No!\nHoward doesn't believe that there is such a thing.\nInstead, he looked at the data, and he said,\nlet's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.\nLet's see if they congregate around certain ideas.\nAnd sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,\nyou realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.\nThere are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;\nthere are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;\nand there are people who like it extra chunky."
p1430
aS'\nAnd of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,\nbecause at the time, in the early 1980s,\nif you went to a supermarket,\nyou would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.\nAnd Prego turned to Howard, and they said,\n"You telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce\nand yet no one is servicing their needs?" And he said yes!\n(Laughter) And Prego then went back,\nand completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,\nand came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely\ntook over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.\nAnd over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars\noff their line of extra-chunky sauces.'
p1431
aS'\nAnd everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,\n"Oh my god! We\'ve been thinking all wrong!"\nAnd that\'s when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,\nand 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil --\nand then eventually even Ragu hired Howard,\nand Howard did the exact same thing for Ragu that he did for Prego.\nAnd today, if you go to the supermarket, a really good one,\nand you look at how many Ragus there are --\ndo you know how many they are? 36!\nIn six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto,\nRich & Hearty, Old World Traditional, Extra-Chunky Garden. (Laughter)\nThat\'s Howard\'s doing. That is Howard\'s gift to the American people.'
p1432
aS'\nNow why is that important?\nIt is, in fact, enormously important. I\'ll explain to you why.\nWhat Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks\nabout making you happy.\nAssumption number one in the food industry used to be\nthat the way to find out what people want to eat --\nwhat will make people happy -- is to ask them.\nAnd for years and years and years and years, Ragu and Prego would have\nfocus groups, and they would sit all you people down, and they would say,\n"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."\nAnd for all those years -- 20, 30 years --\nthrough all those focus group sessions,\nno one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.\nEven though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.\n(Laughter)'
p1433
aS'\nPeople don\'t know what they want! Right?\nAs Howard loves to say, "The mind knows not what the tongue wants."\nIt\'s a mystery!\nAnd a critically important step in understanding our own desires\nand tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want deep down.\nIf I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,\nyou know what you\'d say? Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."\nIt\'s what people always say when you ask them what they want in a coffee.\nWhat do you like? Dark, rich, hearty roast!\nWhat percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?\nAccording to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.\nMost of you like milky, weak coffee.\nBut you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want\nthat "I want a milky, weak coffee." (Laughter)'
p1434
aS'\nSo that\'s number one thing that Howard did.\nNumber two thing that Howard did is he made us realize --\nit\'s another very critical point --\nhe made us realize in the importance of what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."\nWhy is this critical? It\'s critical because\nthis is the way the food industry thought before Howard. Right?\nWhat were they obsessed with in the early \'80s? They were obsessed with mustard.\nIn particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Right?\nUsed to be, there were two mustards. French\'s and Gulden\'s.\nWhat were they? Yellow mustard. What\'s in yellow mustard?\nYellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard.\nGrey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right?\nMuch more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,\nmuch more delicate aromatics. And what do they do?\nThey put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,\nmade it look French, even though it\'s made in Oxnard, California.\nAnd instead of charging a dollar-fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,\nthe way that French\'s and Gulden\'s did, they decided to charge four dollars.\nAnd then they had those ads, right? With the guy in the Rolls Royce,\nand he\'s eating the Grey Poupon. The other Rolls Royce pulls up,\nand he says, do you have any Grey Poupon?\nAnd the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!\nTakes over the mustard business!'
p1435
aS"\nAnd everyone's take-home lesson from that was\nthat the way to get to make people happy\nis to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to. Right?\nIt's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,\nand reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.\nA better mustard! A more expensive mustard!\nA mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.\nAnd Howard looked to that and said, that's wrong!\nMustard does not exist on a hierarchy.\nMustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.\nThere is no good mustard or bad mustard.\nThere is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.\nThere are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.\nHe fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.\nAnd for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks."
p1436
aS'\nThird thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,\nis Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. (Laughter)\nWhat do I mean by that?\nFor the longest time in the food industry,\nthere was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish.\nYou go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi\nwith roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction.\nThey don\'t give you five options on the reduction, right?\nThey don\'t say, do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or do you want the -- no!\nYou just get the reduction. Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse\nhas a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.\nThis is the way it ought to be.\nAnd she serves it that way time and time again,\nand if you quarrel with her, she will say,\n"You know what? You\'re wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."'
p1437
aS"\nNow that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.\nThey had a notion, a Platonic notion, of what tomato sauce was.\nAnd where did that come from? It came from Italy.\nItalian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin.\nThe culture of tomato sauce was thin.\nWhen we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s,\nwe talked about Italian tomato sauce. We talked about the earliest ragus,\nwhich had no visible solids, right?\nWhich were thin, and you just put a little bit over it\nand it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.\nThat's what it was. And why were we attached to that?\nBecause we thought that what it took to make people happy\nwas to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A;\nand B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,\nthen they would embrace it.\nAnd that's what would please the maximum number of people."
p1438
aS"\nAnd the reason we thought that -- in other words,\npeople in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.\nThey were looking for one way to treat all of us.\nAnd it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals,\nbecause all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th,\nwas obsessed with universals.\nPsychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out\nthe rules that govern the way all of us behave.\nBut that changed, right?\nWhat is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?\nIt is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability.\nNow in medical science, we don't want to know how necessarily --\njust how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.\nI guess my cancer different from your cancer.\nGenetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.\nWhat Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same revolution\nneeds to happen in the world of tomato sauce.\nAnd for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks."
p1439
aS"\nI'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.\nHoward not only believed that, but he took it a second step,\nwhich was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,\nwe aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.\nAnd the example he used was coffee.\nAnd coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe.\nIf I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee\n-- a type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy,\nand then I asked you to rate that coffee,\nthe average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.\nIf, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,\nmaybe three or four coffee clusters,\nand I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,\nyour scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.\nThe difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78\nis a difference between coffee that makes you wince,\nand coffee that makes you deliriously happy."
p1440
aS'\nThat is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz:\nthat in embracing the diversity of human beings,\nwe will find a surer way to true happiness.\nThank you.'
p1441
aa(lp1442
S'\nSo, as researchers, something that we often do is use immense resources\nto achieve certain capabilities, or achieve certain goals.\nAnd this is essential to the progress of science,\nor exploration of what is possible.\nBut it sort of creates this unfortunate situation\nwhere a tiny, tiny fraction of the world\ncan actually participate in this exploration\nor can benefit from that technology.\nAnd something that motivates me,\nand what gets me really excited about my research,\nis when I see simple opportunities\nto drastically change that distribution\nand make the technology accessible\nto a much wider percentage of the population.'
p1443
aS"\nAnd I'm going to show you two videos\nthat have gotten a lot of attention recently\nthat I think embody this philosophy.\nAnd they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote.\nNow, for those of you who aren't familiar with this device,\nit's a $40 video game controller.\nAnd it's mostly advertised for its motion sensor capabilities:\nso you can swing a tennis racket, or hit a baseball bat.\nBut what actually interests me a lot more\nis the fact that in the tip of each controller\nis a relatively high-performing infrared camera.\nAnd I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful."
p1444
aS"\nSo here, I have my computer set up with the projector,\nand I have a Wii remote sitting on top of it.\nAnd, for example, if you're in a school\nthat doesn't have a lot money, which is probably a lot of schools,\nor if you're in an office environment,\nand you want an interactive whiteboard,\nnormally these cost about two to three thousand dollars.\nSo what I'm going to show you how to do\nis how to create one with a Wii remote.\nNow, this requires another piece of hardware,\nwhich is this infrared pen.\nYou can probably make this yourself for about five dollars\nwith a quick trip to the Radio Shack.\nIt's essentially got a battery, a button and an infrared LED,\nand it turns on -- you guys can't see it --\nbut it turns on whenever I push the button.\nNow, what this means is that if I run this piece of software,\nthe camera sees the infrared dot,\nand I can register the location of the camera pixels\nto the projector pixels. And now this is like a whiteboard surface.\n(Applause)\nSo for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard.\nThis is Adobe Photoshop.\n(Applause)\nThank you.\n(Laughter)"
p1445
aS"\nNow, the software for this I've actually put on my website\nand have let people download it for free.\nAnd in the three months that this project has been public,\nit's been downloaded over half a million times.\nSo teachers and students all around the world\nare already using this.\n(Applause)\nI want to quickly say that although it does do it for 50 dollars,\nthere are some limitations of this approach.\nBut you get about 80 percent of the way there,\nfor about one percent of the cost.\nAnother nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots,\nso this is actually\na multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well.\n(Applause)"
p1446
aS"\nFor the second demo, I have this Wii remote\nthat's actually next to the TV.\nSo it's pointing away from the display,\nrather than pointing at the display.\nAnd why this is interesting\nis that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses,\nthat have two infrared dots in them,\nwhat these two dots are essentially going to give you\nis, give the computer an approximation of your head location.\nAnd why this is interesting\nis I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor,\nwhich has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it.\nAnd you can see that it looks like a 3D room -- if\nyou can see -- kind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D,\nbut for the most part, the image looks pretty flat,\nand bound to the surface of the screen.\nBut if we turn on head tracking,\nthe computer can change the image that's on the screen\nand make it respond to the head movements.\nSo let's switch back to that.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)"
p1447
aS"\nSo this has actually been a little bit startling\nto the game development community.\n(Laughter)\nBecause this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware\nif you already have a Nintendo Wii.\nSo I'm looking forward to seeing some games,\nand actually Louis Castle, that's him down there,\nlast week announced that Electronic Arts,\none of the largest game publishers, is releasing a game in May\nthat has a little Easter egg feature\nfor supporting this type of head tracking.\nSo -- and that's from less than five months\nfrom a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product.\n(Applause)\nThank you."
p1448
aS"\nBut actually, to me, what's almost more interesting\nthan either of these two products\nis how people actually found out about them.\nYouTube has really changed the way, or changed the speed,\nin which a single individual\ncan actually spread an idea around the world.\nYou know, I'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera,\nand within the first week, a million people had seen this work,\nand literally within days, engineers, teachers and students\nfrom around the world, were already posting their own YouTube videos\nof them using my system or derivatives of this work.\nSo I hope to see more of that in the future,\nand hope online video distribution\nto be embraced by the research community.\nSo thank you very much.\n(Applause)"

p1451
aS"\nI remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen.\nAnd your entire body, everything --\nyour hair, skin, bone, nails --\neverything is made of collagen.\nAnd it's a kind of rope-like structure\nthat twirls and swirls like this.\nAnd the only place that collagen changes its structure\nis in the cornea of your eye.\nIn your eye,\nit becomes a grid formation,\nand therefore, it becomes transparent, as opposed to opaque.\nSo perfectly organized a structure,\nit was hard not to attribute divinity to it.\nBecause we kept on seeing this over and over and over again\nin different parts of the body."

p1457
aS"\nI'm going to show you something pretty unique.\nHere's a human heart at 25 [weeks].\nIt's just basically two strands.\nAnd like this magnificent origami,\ncells are developing\nat one million cells per second at four weeks,\nas it's just folding on itself.\nWithin five weeks, you can start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles.\nSix weeks, these folds are now beginning\nwith the papilla on the inside of the heart\nactually being able to pull down\neach one of those valves in your heart\nuntil you get a mature heart --\nand then basically the development of the entire human body.\nThe magic of the mechanisms\ninside each genetic structure\nsaying exactly where that nerve cell should go --\nthe complexity of these mathematical models\nof how these things are indeed done\nare beyond human comprehension."

aS"\nAnd that instruction set,\nfrom the brain to every other part of the body --\nlook at the complexity of the folding.\nWhere does this intelligence\nof knowing that a fold can actually hold more information,\nso as you actually watch the baby's brain grow --\nand this is one of the things that we're doing right now.\nWe're actually doing the launch of two new studies\nof actually scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born.\nEvery six months until they're six years old --\nwe're going to be doing actually to about 250 children --\nwatching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold\nto see how this magnificent development\nactually turns into memories and the marvel that is us."

S'\nI come from Lebanon,\nand I believe that running can change the world.\nI know what I have just said is simply not obvious.'
p1465
aS"\nYou know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed\nby a long and bloody civil war.\nHonestly, I don't know why they call it civil war\nwhen there is nothing civil about it.\nWith Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south,\nand our government even up till this moment\nis still fragmented and unstable.\nFor years, the country has been divided\nbetween politics and religion.\nHowever, for one day a year,\nwe truly stand united,\nand that's when the marathon takes place."
p1466
aS'\nI used to be a marathon runner.\nLong distance running was not only good for my well-being\nbut it helped me meditate and dream big.\nSo the longer distances I ran,\nthe bigger my dreams became,\nuntil one fateful morning,\nand while training, I was hit by a bus.\nI nearly died, was in a coma,\nstayed at the hospital for two years,\nand underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.'
p1467
aS"\nAs soon as I came out of my coma,\nI realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be,\nso I decided, if I couldn't run myself,\nI wanted to make sure that others could.\nSo out of my hospital bed,\nI asked my husband to start taking notes,\nand a few months later,\nthe marathon was born."
p1468
aS'\nOrganizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident\nmay sound strange,\nbut at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition,\nI needed to dream big.\nI needed something to take me out of my pain,\nan objective to look forward to.\nI didn\'t want to pity myself, nor to be pitied,\nand I thought by organizing such a marathon,\nI\'ll be able to pay back to my community,\nbuild bridges with the outside world,\nand invite runners to come to Lebanon\nand run under the umbrella of peace.\nOrganizing a marathon in Lebanon\nis definitely not like organizing one in New York.\nHow do you introduce the concept of running\nto a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?\nHow do you ask those who were once fighting\nand killing each other\nto come together and run next to each other?\nMore than that, how do you convince people\nto run a distance of 26.2 miles\nat a time they were not even familiar\nwith the word "marathon"?\nSo we had to start from scratch.'
p1469
aS'\nFor almost two years, we went all over the country\nand even visited remote villages.\nI personally met with people from all walks of life --\nmayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,\npoliticians, militiamen, people from mosques, churches,\nthe president of the country, even housewives.\nI learned one thing:\nWhen you walk the talk, people believe you.\nMany were touched by my personal story,\nand they shared their stories in return.\nIt was honesty and transparency that brought us together.\nWe spoke one common language to each other,\nand that was from one human to another.\nOnce that trust was built,\neverybody wanted to be part of the marathon\nto show the world the true colors of Lebanon\nand the Lebanese\nand their desire to live in peace and harmony.'
p1470
aS'\nIn October 2003, over 6,000 runners\nfrom 49 different nationalities\ncame to the start line, all determined,\nand when the gunfire went off,\nthis time it was a signal to run in harmony\nfor a change.'
p1471
aS'\nThe marathon grew.\nSo did our political problems.\nBut for every disaster we had,\nthe marathon found ways to bring people together.\nIn 2005, our prime minister was assassinated,\nand the country came to a complete standstill,\nso we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.\nOver 60,000 people came to the start line,\nall wearing white t-shirts with no political slogans.\nThat was a turning point for the marathon,\nwhere people started looking at it as a platform\nfor peace and unity.'
p1472
aS'\nBetween 2006 up to 2009, our country, Lebanon,\nwent through unstable years,\ninvasions, and more assassinations\nthat brought us close to a civil war.\nThe country was divided again,\nso much that our parliament resigned,\nwe had no president for a year, and no prime minister.\nBut we did have a marathon.'

S"\nSo for any of us in this room today,\nlet's start out by admitting we're lucky.\nWe don't live in the world\nour mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in,\nwhere career choices for women were so limited.\nAnd if you're in this room today,\nmost of us grew up in a world\nwhere we had basic civil rights,\nand amazingly, we still live in a world\nwhere some women don't have them.\nBut all that aside, we still have a problem,\nand it's a real problem.\nAnd the problem is this:\nWomen are not making it\nto the top of any profession\nanywhere in the world.\nThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.\n190 heads of state --\nnine are women.\nOf all the people in parliament in the world,\n13 percent are women.\nIn the corporate sector,\nwomen at the top,\nC-level jobs, board seats --\ntops out at 15, 16 percent.\nThe numbers have not moved since 2002\nand are going in the wrong direction.\nAnd even in the non-profit world,\na world we sometimes think of\nas being led by more women,\nwomen at the top: 20 percent."
p1516
aS'\nWe also have another problem,\nwhich is that women face harder choices\nbetween professional success and personal fulfillment.\nA recent study in the U.S.\nshowed that, of married senior managers,\ntwo-thirds of the married men had children\nand only one-third of the married women had children.\nA couple of years ago, I was in New York,\nand I was pitching a deal,\nand I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices\nyou can picture.\nAnd I\'m in the meeting -- it\'s about a three-hour meeting --\nand two hours in, there kind of needs to be that bio break,\nand everyone stands up,\nand the partner running the meeting\nstarts looking really embarrassed.\nAnd I realized he doesn\'t know\nwhere the women\'s room is in his office.\nSo I start looking around for moving boxes,\nfiguring they just moved in, but I don\'t see any.\nAnd so I said, "Did you just move into this office?"\nAnd he said, "No, we\'ve been here about a year."\nAnd I said, "Are you telling me\nthat I am the only woman\nto have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"\nAnd he looked at me, and he said,\n"Yeah. Or maybe you\'re the only one who had to go to the bathroom."'
p1517
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1518
aS"\nSo the question is,\nhow are we going to fix this?\nHow do we change these numbers at the top?\nHow do we make this different?\nI want to start out by saying,\nI talk about this --\nabout keeping women in the workforce --\nbecause I really think that's the answer.\nIn the high-income part of our workforce,\nin the people who end up at the top --\nFortune 500 CEO jobs,\nor the equivalent in other industries --\nthe problem, I am convinced,\nis that women are dropping out.\nNow people talk about this a lot,\nand they talk about things like flextime and mentoring\nand programs companies should have to train women.\nI want to talk about none of that today,\neven though that's all really important.\nToday I want to focus on what we can do as individuals.\nWhat are the messages we need to tell ourselves?\nWhat are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us?\nWhat are the messages we tell our daughters?"
p1519
aS'\nNow, at the outset, I want to be very clear\nthat this speech comes with no judgments.\nI don\'t have the right answer.\nI don\'t even have it for myself.\nI left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday,\nand I was getting on the plane for this conference.\nAnd my daughter, who\'s three, when I dropped her off at preschool,\ndid that whole hugging-the-leg,\ncrying, "Mommy, don\'t get on the plane" thing.\nThis is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.\nI know no women,\nwhether they\'re at home or whether they\'re in the workforce,\nwho don\'t feel that sometimes.\nSo I\'m not saying that staying in the workforce\nis the right thing for everyone.'
p1520
aS'\nMy talk today is about what the messages are\nif you do want to stay in the workforce,\nand I think there are three.\nOne, sit at the table.\nTwo, make your partner a real partner.\nAnd three, don\'t leave before you leave.\nNumber one: sit at the table.\nJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,\nwe hosted a very senior government official,\nand he came in to meet with senior execs\nfrom around Silicon Valley.\nAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.\nAnd then he had these two women who were traveling with him\nwho were pretty senior in his department,\nand I kind of said to them, "Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,"\nand they sat on the side of the room.\nWhen I was in college my senior year,\nI took a course called European Intellectual History.\nDon\'t you love that kind of thing from college?\nI wish I could do that now.\nAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,\nwho was then a brilliant literary student --\nand went on to be a brilliant literary scholar --\nand my brother --\nsmart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med,\nwho was a sophomore.'
p1521
aS'\nThe three of us take this class together.\nAnd then Carrie reads all the books\nin the original Greek and Latin,\ngoes to all the lectures.\nI read all the books in English\nand go to most of the lectures.\nMy brother is kind of busy.\nHe reads one book of 12\nand goes to a couple of lectures,\nmarches himself up to our room\na couple days before the exam to get himself tutored.\nThe three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.\nAnd we sit there for three hours --\nand our little blue notebooks -- yes, I\'m that old.\nAnd we walk out, and we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?"\nAnd Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn\'t really draw out the main point\non the Hegelian dialectic."\nAnd I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected\nJohn Locke\'s theory of property with the philosophers who follow."\nAnd my brother says,\n"I got the top grade in the class."\n"You got the top grade in the class?\nYou don\'t know anything."'
p1522
aS'\nThe problem with these stories\nis that they show what the data shows:\nwomen systematically underestimate their own abilities.\nIf you test men and women,\nand you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs,\nmen get it wrong slightly high,\nand women get it wrong slightly low.\nWomen do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.\nA study in the last two years\nof people entering the workforce out of college\nshowed that 57 percent of boys entering,\nor men, I guess,\nare negotiating their first salary,\nand only seven percent of women.\nAnd most importantly,\nmen attribute their success to themselves,\nand women attribute it to other external factors.\nIf you ask men why they did a good job,\nthey\'ll say, "I\'m awesome.\nObviously. Why are you even asking?"\nIf you ask women why they did a good job,\nwhat they\'ll say is someone helped them,\nthey got lucky, they worked really hard.\nWhy does this matter?\nBoy, it matters a lot\nbecause no one gets to the corner office\nby sitting on the side, not at the table,\nand no one gets the promotion\nif they don\'t think they deserve their success,\nor they don\'t even understand their own success.'
p1523
aS'\nI wish the answer were easy.\nI wish I could just go tell all the young women I work for,\nall these fabulous women,\n"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself.\nOwn your own success."\nI wish I could tell that to my daughter.\nBut it\'s not that simple.\nBecause what the data shows, above all else, is one thing,\nwhich is that success and likeability\nare positively correlated for men\nand negatively correlated for women.\nAnd everyone\'s nodding,\nbecause we all know this to be true.'
p1524
aS'\nThere\'s a really good study that shows this really well.\nThere\'s a famous Harvard Business School study\non a woman named Heidi Roizen.\nAnd she\'s an operator in a company\nin Silicon Valley,\nand she uses her contacts\nto become a very successful venture capitalist.\nIn 2002 -- not so long ago --\na professor who was then at Columbia University\ntook that case and made it Howard Roizen.\nAnd he gave the case out, both of them,\nto two groups of students.\nHe changed exactly one word:\n"Heidi" to "Howard."\nBut that one word made a really big difference.\nHe then surveyed the students,\nand the good news was the students, both men and women,\nthought Heidi and Howard were equally competent,\nand that\'s good.\nThe bad news was that everyone liked Howard.\nHe\'s a great guy. You want to work for him.\nYou want to spend the day fishing with him.\nBut Heidi? Not so sure.\nShe\'s a little out for herself. She\'s a little political.\nYou\'re not sure you\'d want to work for her.\nThis is the complication.\nWe have to tell our daughters and our colleagues,\nwe have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A,\nto reach for the promotion,\nto sit at the table,\nand we have to do it in a world\nwhere, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that,\neven though for their brothers, there are not.'
p1525
aS'\nThe saddest thing about all of this is that it\'s really hard to remember this.\nAnd I\'m about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me,\nbut I think important.\nI gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago\nto about 100 employees,\nand a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there\nsitting outside my little desk,\nand she wanted to talk to me.\nI said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.\nAnd she said, "I learned something today.\nI learned that I need to keep my hand up."\nI said, "What do you mean?"\nShe said, "Well, you\'re giving this talk,\nand you said you were going to take two more questions.\nAnd I had my hand up with lots of other people, and you took two more questions.\nAnd I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women put their hand down,\nand then you took more questions,\nonly from the men."\nAnd I thought to myself,\nwow, if it\'s me -- who cares about this, obviously --\ngiving this talk --\nand during this talk, I can\'t even notice\nthat the men\'s hands are still raised,\nand the women\'s hands are still raised,\nhow good are we\nas managers of our companies and our organizations\nat seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities\nmore than women?\nWe\'ve got to get women to sit at the table.'
p1526
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1527
aS"\nMessage number two:\nmake your partner a real partner.\nI've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce\nthan we have in the home.\nThe data shows this very clearly.\nIf a woman and a man work full-time\nand have a child,\nthe woman does twice the amount of housework the man does,\nand the woman does three times\nthe amount of childcare the man does.\nSo she's got three jobs or two jobs,\nand he's got one.\nWho do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more?\nThe causes of this are really complicated,\nand I don't have time to go into them.\nAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching\nand general laziness is the cause."
p1528
aS"\nI think the cause is more complicated.\nI think, as a society,\nwe put more pressure on our boys to succeed\nthan we do on our girls.\nI know men that stay home\nand work in the home to support wives with careers,\nand it's hard.\nWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff\nand I see the father there,\nI notice that the other mommies\ndon't play with him.\nAnd that's a problem,\nbecause we have to make it as important a job,\nbecause it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home,\nfor people of both genders,\nif we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.\n(Applause)\nStudies show that households with equal earning\nand equal responsibility\nalso have half the divorce rate.\nAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there,\nthey also have more --\nhow shall I say this on this stage? --\nthey know each other more in the biblical sense as well."
p1529
aS'\n(Cheers)'
p1530
aS'\nMessage number three:\ndon\'t leave before you leave.\nI think there\'s a really deep irony\nto the fact that actions women are taking --\nand I see this all the time --\nwith the objective of staying in the workforce\nactually lead to their eventually leaving.\nHere\'s what happens:\nWe\'re all busy. Everyone\'s busy. A woman\'s busy.\nAnd she starts thinking about having a child,\nand from the moment she starts thinking about having a child,\nshe starts thinking about making room for that child.\n"How am I going to fit this into everything else I\'m doing?"\nAnd literally from that moment,\nshe doesn\'t raise her hand anymore,\nshe doesn\'t look for a promotion, she doesn\'t take on the new project,\nshe doesn\'t say, "Me. I want to do that."\nShe starts leaning back.\nThe problem is that --\nlet\'s say she got pregnant that day, that day --\nnine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave,\nsix months to catch your breath --\nfast-forward two years,\nmore often -- and as I\'ve seen it --\nwomen start thinking about this way earlier --\nwhen they get engaged, when they get married,\nwhen they start thinking about trying to have a child, which can take a long time.\nOne woman came to see me about this,\nand I kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young.\nAnd I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?"\nAnd she said, "Oh no, I\'m not married."\nShe didn\'t even have a boyfriend.\nI said, "You\'re thinking about this\njust way too early."'
p1531
aS"\nBut the point is that what happens\nonce you start kind of quietly leaning back?\nEveryone who's been through this --\nand I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home,\nyour job better be really good to go back,\nbecause it's hard to leave that kid at home --\nyour job needs to be challenging.\nIt needs to be rewarding.\nYou need to feel like you're making a difference.\nAnd if two years ago you didn't take a promotion\nand some guy next to you did,\nif three years ago\nyou stopped looking for new opportunities,\nyou're going to be bored\nbecause you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.\nDon't leave before you leave.\nStay in.\nKeep your foot on the gas pedal,\nuntil the very day you need to leave\nto take a break for a child --\nand then make your decisions.\nDon't make decisions too far in advance,\nparticularly ones you're not even conscious you're making."
p1532
aS"\nMy generation really, sadly,\nis not going to change the numbers at the top.\nThey're just not moving.\nWe are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population --\nin my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women]\nat the top of any industry.\nBut I'm hopeful that future generations can.\nI think a world that was run\nwhere half of our countries and half of our companies\nwere run by women, would be a better world.\nAnd it's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are,\neven though that would be very helpful.\nI think it would be a better world.\nI have two children.\nI have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.\nI want my son to have a choice\nto contribute fully in the workforce or at home,\nand I want my daughter to have the choice\nto not just succeed,\nbut to be liked for her accomplishments."

aS'\nThank you.'

p1535
aa(lp1536
S"\nI'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.\nI like special missions and secret objectives.\nSo here's my special mission for this talk:\nI'm going to try to increase the life span\nof every single person in this room\nby seven and a half minutes.\nLiterally, you will live seven and half minutes longer\nthan you would have otherwise,\njust because you watched this talk."
p1537
aS"\nOkay, some of you are looking a little bit skeptical.\nThat's okay, because check it out --\nI have math to prove that it is possible.\nAnd it won't make a lot of sense now.\nI'll explain it all later,\njust pay attention to the number at the bottom:\nplus-7.68245837 minutes\nthat will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission."
p1538
aS"\nNow, you have a secret mission too.\nYour mission is to figure out how you want to spend your\nextra seven and a half minutes.\nAnd I think you should do something unusual with them,\nbecause these are bonus minutes. You weren't going to have them anyway."
p1539
aS"\nNow, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself,\nI know what she wants us to do with those minutes,\nshe wants us to spend them playing games.\nNow this is a totally reasonable assumption,\ngiven that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people\nto spend more time playing games.\nFor example, in my first TEDTalk,\nI did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week\nas a planet playing video games."
p1540
aS'\nNow, 21 billion hours, it\'s a lot of time.\nIt\'s so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment\nthat I have heard from people all over the world\nsince I gave that talk, is this:\nJane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed,\nare you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?\nThis idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time\nthat we will come to regret -- that I hear it literally everywhere I go.\nFor example, true story: Just a few weeks ago,\nthis cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town\nfor a game developer\'s conference,\nturned around and said -- and I quote --\n"I hate games. Waste of life. Imagine getting to the end of your life\nand regretting all that time."'
p1541
aS"\nNow, I want to take this problem seriously.\nI mean, I want games to be a force for good in the world.\nI don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing,\ntime that I encouraged them to spend.\nSo I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.\nWhen we're on our deathbeds, will we regret\nthe time we spent playing games?"
p1542
aS"\nNow, this may surprise you, but it turns out\nthere is actually some scientific research on this question.\nIt's true. Hospice workers,\nthe people who take care of us at the end of our lives,\nrecently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets\nthat people say when they are literally on their deathbeds.\nAnd that's what I want to share with you today --\nthe top five regrets of the dying."
p1543
aS"\nNumber one: I wish I hadn't worked so hard.\nNumber two: I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.\nNumber three: I wish I had let myself be happier.\nNumber four: I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.\nAnd number five: I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,\ninstead of what others expected of me."
p1544
aS"\nNow, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers,\nI wish I'd spent more time playing video games,\nbut when I hear these top five regrets of the dying,\nI can't help but hear five deep human cravings\nthat games actually help us fulfill."
p1545
aS"\nFor example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.\nFor many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time\nwith my family, with my kids when they were growing up.\nWell, we know that playing games together has tremendous\nfamily benefits.\nA recent study from Brigham Young University\nSchool of Family life reported that parents who\nspend more time playing video games with their kids\nhave much stronger real-life relationships with them."
p1546
aS"\nI wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends.\nWell, hundreds of millions of people\nuse social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends\nto stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family.\nA recent study from [University of Michigan] showed\nthat these games are incredibly powerful\nrelationship-management tools.\nThey help us stay connected with people in our social network\nthat we would otherwise grow distant from,\nif we weren't playing games together."
p1547
aS"\nI wish I'd let myself be happier.\nWell, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials\nrecently conducted at East Carolina University\nthat showed that online games can outperform\npharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression.\nJust 30 minutes of online game play a day\nwas enough to create dramatic boosts in mood\nand long-term increases in happiness."
p1548
aS"\nI wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.\nWell, avatars are a way to express our true selves,\nour most heroic, idealized version of who we might become.\nYou can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper\nof a gamer with his avatar.\nAnd Stanford University has been doing research for five years now\nto document how playing a game with an idealized avatar\nchanges how we think and act in real life,\nmaking us more courageous, more ambitious,\nmore committed to our goals."
p1549
aS"\nI wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,\nand not what others expected of me.\nAre games doing this yet? I'm not sure,\nso I've left a question mark, a Super Mario question mark.\nAnd we're going to come back to this one."
p1550
aS"\nBut in the mean time, perhaps you're wondering,\nwho is this game designer to be talking to us\nabout deathbed regrets?\nAnd it's true, I've never worked in a hospice,\nI've never been on my deathbed.\nBut recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.\nReally wanting to die."
p1551
aS"\nNow let me tell you that story.\nIt started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.\nNow the concussion didn't heal properly,\nand after 30 days I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches,\nnausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.\nMy doctor told me that in order to heal my brain,\nI had to rest it.\nSo I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.\nFor me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games,\nno work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.\nIn other words -- and I think you see where this is going --\nno reason to live."
p1552
aS"\nOf course it's meant to be funny,\nbut in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common\nwith traumatic brain injuries.\nIt happens to one in three, and it happened to me.\nMy brain started telling me, Jane, you want to die.\nIt said, you're never going to get better.\nIt said, the pain will never end."
p1553
aS"\nAnd these voices became so persistent and so persuasive\nthat I started to legitimately fear for my life,\nwhich is the time that I said to myself after 34 days --\nand I will never forget this moment --\nI said, I am either going to kill myself\nor I'm going to turn this into a game."
p1554
aS"\nNow, why a game?\nI knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade\nthat when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature --\nwe tackle tough challenges with more creativity,\nmore determination, more optimism,\nand we're more likely to reach out to others for help.\nAnd I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge,\nso I created a role-playing recovery game\ncalled Jane the Concussion Slayer."
p1555
aS"\nNow this became my new secret identity,\nand the first thing I did as a slayer\nwas call my twin sister -- I have an identical twin sister named Kelly --\nand tell her, I'm playing a game to heal my brain,\nand I want you to play with me.\nThis was an easier way to ask for help."
p1556
aS'\nShe became my first ally in the game,\nmy husband Kiyash joined next,\nand together we identified and battled the bad guys.\nNow this was anything that could trigger my symptoms\nand therefore slow down the healing process,\nthings like bright lights and crowded spaces.\nWe also collected and activated power-ups.\nThis was anything I could do on even my worst day\nto feel just a little bit good,\njust a little bit productive.\nThings like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes,\nor getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.'
p1557
aS"\nNow the game was that simple:\nAdopt a secret identity, recruit your allies,\nbattle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.\nBut even with a game so simple,\nwithin just a couple days of starting to play,\nthat fog of depression and anxiety\nwent away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.\nNow it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches\nor the cognitive symptoms.\nThat lasted for more than a year,\nand it was the hardest year of my life by far.\nBut even when I still had the symptoms,\neven while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering."
p1558
aS'\nNow what happened next with the game surprised me.\nI put up some blog posts and videos online,\nexplaining how to play.\nBut not everybody has a concussion, obviously,\nnot everyone wants to be "the slayer,"\nso I renamed the game SuperBetter.'
p1559
aS'\nAnd soon I started hearing from people all over the world\nwho were adopting their own secret identity,\nrecruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better"\nfacing challenges like cancer and chronic pain,\ndepression and Crohn\'s disease.\nEven people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.\nAnd I could tell from their messages and their videos\nthat the game was helping them in the same ways\nthat it helped me.\nThey talked about feeling stronger and braver.\nThey talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.\nAnd they even talked about feeling happier,\neven though they were in pain, even though they were tackling\nthe toughest challenge of their lives.'
p1560
aS"\nNow at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?\nI mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully\nin such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?\nI mean, if it hadn't worked for me,\nthere's no way I would have believed it was possible.\nWell, it turns out there's some science here too.\nSome people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.\nAnd that's what was happening to us."
p1561
aS"\nThe game was helping us experience\nwhat scientists call post-traumatic growth,\nwhich is not something we usually hear about.\nWe usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.\nBut scientists now know that a traumatic event\ndoesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.\nInstead, we can use it as a springboard\nto unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives."
p1562
aS"\nHere are the top five things that people with\npost-traumatic growth say:\nMy priorities have changed. I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy.\nI feel closer to my friends and family.\nI understand myself better. I know who I really am now.\nI have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.\nI'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams."
p1563
aS'\nNow, does this sound familiar?\nIt should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth\nare essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.\nNow this is interesting, right?\nIt seems that somehow, a traumatic event can unlock our ability\nto lead a life with fewer regrets.'
p1564
aS'\nBut how does it work?\nHow do you get from trauma to growth?\nOr better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits\nof post-traumatic growth without the trauma,\nwithout having to hit your head in the first place?\nThat would be good, right?'
p1565
aS"\nI wanted to understand the phenomenon better,\nso I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.\nThere are four kinds of strength, or resilience,\nthat contribute to post-traumatic growth,\nand there are scientifically validated activities\nthat you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience,\nand you don't need a trauma to do it."
p1566
aS"\nNow, I could tell you what these four types of strength are,\nbut I'd rather you experience them firsthand.\nI'd rather we all start building them up together right now.\nSo here's what we're going to do.\nWe're going to play a quick game together.\nThis is where you earn those seven and a half minutes\nof bonus life that I promised you earlier.\nAll you have to do is successfully complete\nthe first four SuperBetter quests.\nAnd I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you."
p1567
aS'\nSo, everybody ready? This is your first quest. Here we go.\nPick one: Stand up and take three steps,\nor make your hands into fists, raise them over your head\nas high as you can for five seconds. Go!\nAll right, I like the people doing both. You are overachievers.\nVery good. (Laughter)'
p1568
aS"\nWell done, everyone. Now that is worth plus-one\nphysical resilience, which means that your body can\nwithstand more stress and heal itself faster.\nNow we know from the research that the number one thing\nyou can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still.\nThat's all it takes.\nEvery single second that you are not sitting still,\nyou are actively improving the health of your heart,\nand your lungs and brains."
p1569
aS'\nEverybody ready for your next quest?\nI want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times,\nor count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93 ...\nGo!'
p1570
aS'\n(Snapping)'
p1571
aS"\nDon't give up."
p1572
aS'\n(Snapping)'
p1573
aS"\nDon't let the people counting down from 100\ninterfere with your counting to 50."
p1574
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1575
aS"\nNice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that.\nBonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.\nNow that's worth plus-one mental resilience,\nwhich means you have more mental focus, more discipline,\ndetermination and willpower.\nWe know from the scientific research that willpower\nactually works like a muscle.\nIt gets stronger the more you exercise it.\nSo tackling a tiny challenge without giving up,\neven one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times\nor counting backwards from 100 by seven\nis actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower."
p1576
aS'\nSo good job. Quest number three.\nPick one: Now because of the room we\'re in,\nfate\'s really determined this for you, but here are the two options.\nIf you\'re inside, find a window and look out of it.\nIf you\'re outside, find a window and look in.\nOr do a quick YouTube or Google image search for\n"baby [your favorite animal.]"'
p1577
aS"\nNow, you could do this on your phones,\nor you could just shout out some baby animals,\nI'm going to find some and put them on the screen for us.\nSo, what do we want to see?\nSloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.\nBaby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.\nGot that?\nOkay, one more. Baby elephant.\nWe're clapping for that?\nThat's amazing."

aS"\nAll right, now what we're just feeling there\nis plus-one emotional resilience,\nwhich means you have the ability to provoke powerful,\npositive emotions like curiosity or love,\nwhich we feel when we look at baby animals,\nwhen you need them most."
p1579
aS"\nAnd here's a secret from the scientific literature for you.\nIf you can manage to experience three positive emotions\nfor every one negative emotion over the course of an hour,\na day, a week, you dramatically improve\nyour health and your ability to successfully tackle\nany problem you're facing.\nAnd this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.\nIt's my favorite SuperBetter trick, so keep it up."

p1582
aS'\nLooking good, looking good.\nNice, nice.\nKeep it up.

p1583
aS"\nHere's one more secret for you:\nShaking someone's hand for six seconds\ndramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream,\nnow that's the trust hormone.\nThat means that all of you who just shook hands\nare biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.\nThis will linger during the break,\nso take advantage of the networking opportunities."

p1585
aS"\nOkay, well you have successfully completed your four quests,\nso let's see if I've successfully completed my mission\nto give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.\nAnd here's where I get to share one more little bit of science with you.\nIt turns out that people who regularly\nboost these four types of resilience --\nphysical, mental, emotional and social --\nlive 10 years longer than everyone else.\nSo this is true.\nIf you are regularly achieving the three-to-one\npositive emotion ratio,\nif you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time,\nif you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day,\nif you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower,\nyou will live 10 years longer than everyone else,\nand here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in."
p1586
aS"\nSo, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,\nbut we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies\nthat you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting\nyour four types of resilience.\nSo every single year that you are\nboosting your four types of resilience,\nyou're actually earning .128 more years of life\nor 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life,\nwhich means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life,\nor every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience,\nlike we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837\nmore minutes of life."

p1589
aS'\nYeah! Awesome.\nWait, wait, wait.\nYou still have your special mission,\nyour secret mission.\nHow are you going to spend these seven and a half\nminutes of bonus life?'
p1590
aS"\nWell, here's my suggestion.\nThese seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes.\nYou can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes.\nPretty clever, right?\nSo, if you spend these seven and a half minutes today\ndoing something that makes you happy,\nor that gets you physically active,\nor puts you in touch with someone you care about,\nor even just tackling a tiny challenge,\nyou are going to boost your resilience,\nso you're going to earn more minutes."
p1591
aS'\nAnd the good news is, you can keep going like that.\nEvery hour of the day, every day of your life,\nall the way to your deathbed,\nwhich will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise.\nAnd when you get there, more than likely,\nyou will not have any of those top five regrets,\nbecause you will have built up the strength and resilience\nto lead a life truer to your dreams.\nAnd with 10 extra years, you might even have enough time\nto play a few more games.'

S"\nWhat I'd like to do today is talk about one\nof my favorite subjects,\nand that is the neuroscience of sleep."
p1596
aS"\nNow, there is a sound --\n(Alarm clock) --\naah, it worked --\na sound that is desperately, desperately familiar to most of us,\nand of course it's the sound of the alarm clock.\nAnd what that truly ghastly, awful sound does\nis stop the single most important behavioral experience\nthat we have, and that's sleep.\nIf you're an average sort of person,\n36 percent of your life will be spent asleep,\nwhich means that if you live to 90,\nthen 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep."
p1597
aS"\nNow what that 32 years is telling us\nis that sleep at some level is important.\nAnd yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.\nWe throw it away.\nWe really just don't think about sleep.\nAnd so what I'd like to do today\nis change your views,\nchange your ideas and your thoughts about sleep.\nAnd the journey that I want to take you on,\nwe need to start by going back in time."
p1598
aS'\n"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."\nAny ideas who said that?\nShakespeare\'s Julius Caesar.\nYes, let me give you a few more quotes.\n"O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature\'s soft nurse,\nhow have I frighted thee?"\nShakespeare again, from -- I won\'t say it --\nthe Scottish play. [Correction: Henry IV, Part 2]\n(Laughter)\nFrom the same time:\n"Sleep is the golden chain\nthat ties health and our bodies together."\nExtremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,\nanother Elizabethan dramatist.'
p1599
aS'\nBut if we jump forward 400 years,\nthe tone about sleep changes somewhat.\nThis is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century.\n"Sleep is a criminal waste of time\nand a heritage from our cave days." Bang.\n(Laughter)\nAnd if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you\nmay remember that Margaret Thatcher\nwas reported to have said, "Sleep is for wimps."\nAnd of course the infamous -- what was his name? --\nthe infamous Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street" said,\n"Money never sleeps."'
p1600
aS"\nWhat do we do in the 20th century about sleep?\nWell, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb\nto invade the night, and we occupied the dark,\nand in the process of this occupation,\nwe've treated sleep as an illness, almost.\nWe've treated it as an enemy.\nAt most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep,\nand at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep\nas an illness that needs some sort of a cure.\nAnd our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound."
p1601
aS"\nWhy is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts?\nWell, it's because you don't do anything much\nwhile you're asleep, it seems.\nYou don't eat. You don't drink.\nAnd you don't have sex.\nWell, most of us anyway.\nAnd so therefore it's --\nSorry. It's a complete waste of time, right? Wrong.\nActually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology,\nand neuroscientists are beginning to explain why\nit's so very important.\nSo let's move to the brain."
p1602
aS"\nNow, here we have a brain.\nThis is donated by a social scientist,\nand they said they didn't know what it was,\nor indeed how to use it, so --\n(Laughter)\nSorry.\nSo I borrowed it. I don't think they noticed. Okay.\n(Laughter)"
p1603
aS"\nThe point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep,\nthis thing doesn't shut down.\nIn fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active\nduring the sleep state than during the wake state.\nThe other thing that's really important about sleep\nis that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain,\nbut is to some extent a network property,\nand if we flip the brain on its back --\nI love this little bit of spinal cord here --\nthis bit here is the hypothalamus,\nand right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures,\nnot least the biological clock.\nThe biological clock tells us when it's good to be up,\nwhen it's good to be asleep,\nand what that structure does is interact\nwith a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus,\nthe lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.\nAll of those combine, and they send projections\ndown to the brain stem here.\nThe brain stem then projects forward\nand bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,\nwith neurotransmitters that keep us awake\nand essentially provide us with our consciousness.\nSo sleep arises from a whole raft\nof different interactions within the brain,\nand essentially, sleep is turned on and off\nas a result of a range of interactions in here."
p1604
aS"\nOkay. So where have we got to?\nWe've said that sleep is complicated\nand it takes 32 years of our life.\nBut what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.\nSo why do we sleep?\nAnd it won't surprise any of you that, of course,\nthe scientists, we don't have a consensus.\nThere are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep,\nand I'm going to outline three of those."
p1605
aS"\nThe first is sort of the restoration idea,\nand it's somewhat intuitive.\nEssentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day,\nwe restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night.\nAnd indeed, as an explanation,\nit goes back to Aristotle,\nso that's, what, 2,300 years ago.\nIt's gone in and out of fashion.\nIt's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown\nis that within the brain, a whole raft of genes\nhave been shown to be turned on only during sleep,\nand those genes are associated with restoration\nand metabolic pathways.\nSo there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis."
p1606
aS"\nWhat about energy conservation?\nAgain, perhaps intuitive.\nYou essentially sleep to save calories.\nNow, when you do the sums, though,\nit doesn't really pan out.\nIf you compare an individual who has\nslept at night, or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much,\nthe energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night.\nNow, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun.\nNow, I would say that a hot dog bun\nis kind of a meager return for such a complicated\nand demanding behavior as sleep.\nSo I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea."
p1607
aS"\nBut the third idea I'm quite attracted to,\nwhich is brain processing and memory consolidation.\nWhat we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task,\nand you sleep-deprive individuals,\nthe ability to learn that task is smashed.\nIt's really hugely attenuated.\nSo sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.\nHowever, it's not just the laying down of memory\nand recalling it.\nWhat's turned out to be really exciting\nis that our ability to come up with novel solutions\nto complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.\nIn fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage.\nSleeping at night enhances our creativity.\nAnd what seems to be going on is that, in the brain,\nthose neural connections that are important,\nthose synaptic connections that are important,\nare linked and strengthened,\nwhile those that are less important\ntend to fade away and be less important."
p1608
aS"\nOkay. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep,\nand I think the important thing to realize is that\nthe details will vary, and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.\nBut sleep is not an indulgence.\nIt's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually.\nI think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade\nfrom economy to business class, you know, the equiavlent of.\nIt's not even an upgrade from economy to first class.\nThe critical thing to realize is that\nif you don't sleep, you don't fly.\nEssentially, you never get there,\nand what's extraordinary about much of our society these days\nis that we are desperately sleep-deprived."
p1609
aS'\nSo let\'s now look at sleep deprivation.\nHuge sectors of society are sleep-deprived,\nand let\'s look at our sleep-o-meter.\nSo in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us\nwere getting around about eight hours of sleep a night.\nNowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night,\nso we\'re in the six-and-a-half-hours-every-night league.\nFor teenagers, it\'s worse, much worse.\nThey need nine hours for full brain performance,\nand many of them, on a school night,\nare only getting five hours of sleep.\nIt\'s simply not enough.\nIf we think about other sectors of society, the aged,\nif you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block\nis somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again,\nless than five hours a night.\nShift work. Shift work is extraordinary,\nperhaps 20 percent of the working population,\nand the body clock does not shift to the demands\nof working at night.\nIt\'s locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us.\nSo when the poor old shift worker is going home\nto try and sleep during the day, desperately tired,\nthe body clock is saying, "Wake up. This is the time to be awake."\nSo the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker\nis usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region.\nAnd then, of course, tens of millions of people\nsuffer from jet lag.\nSo who here has jet lag?\nWell, my goodness gracious.\nWell, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep,\nbecause that\'s what your brain is craving.'
p1610
aS"\nOne of the things that the brain does\nis indulge in micro-sleeps,\nthis involuntary falling asleep,\nand you have essentially no control over it.\nNow, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing,\nbut they can also be deadly.\nIt's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers\nwill fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life,\nand in the U.S., the statistics are pretty good:\n100,000 accidents on the freeway\nhave been associated with tiredness,\nloss of vigilance, and falling asleep.\nA hundred thousand a year. It's extraordinary.\nAt another level of terror,\nwe dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl\nand indeed the space shuttle Challenger,\nwhich was so tragically lost.\nAnd in the investigations that followed those disasters,\npoor judgment as a result of extended shift work\nand loss of vigilance and tiredness\nwas attributed to a big chunk of those disasters."
p1611
aS"\nSo when you're tired, and you lack sleep,\nyou have poor memory, you have poor creativity,\nyou have increased impulsiveness,\nand you have overall poor judgment.\nBut my friends, it's so much worse than that."
p1612
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1613
aS'\nIf you are a tired brain,\nthe brain is craving things to wake it up.\nSo drugs, stimulants. Caffeine represents\nthe stimulant of choice across much of the Western world.\nMuch of the day is fueled by caffeine,\nand if you\'re a really naughty tired brain, nicotine.\nAnd of course, you\'re fueling the waking state\nwith these stimulants,\nand then of course it gets to 11 o\'clock at night,\nand the brain says to itself, "Ah, well actually,\nI need to be asleep fairly shortly.\nWhat do we do about that when I\'m feeling completely wired?"\nWell, of course, you then resort to alcohol.\nNow alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice,\nto use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.\nIt can actually ease the sleep transition.\nBut what you must be so aware of\nis that alcohol doesn\'t provide sleep,\na biological mimic for sleep. It sedates you.\nSo it actually harms some of the neural proccessing\nthat\'s going on during memory consolidation\nand memory recall.\nSo it\'s a short-term acute measure,\nbut for goodness sake, don\'t become addicted\nto alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night.'
p1614
aS'\nAnother connection between loss of sleep is weight gain.\nIf you sleep around about five hours or less every night,\nthen you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.\nWhat\'s the connection here?\nWell, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release\nof the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone.\nGhrelin is released. It gets to the brain.\nThe brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"\nand what it does is seek out carbohydrates\nand particularly sugars.\nSo there\'s a link between tiredness\nand the metabolic predisposition for weight gain.'
p1615
aS"\nStress. Tired people are massively stressed.\nAnd one of the things of stress, of course,\nis loss of memory,\nwhich is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of.\nBut stress is so much more.\nSo if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem,\nbut it's sustained stress\nassociated with sleep loss that's the problem.\nSo sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity,\nand so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection,\nand there's some very good studies showing\nthat shift workers, for example, have higher rates of cancer.\nIncreased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation.\nGlucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature\nand essentially you become glucose intolerant.\nTherefore, diabetes 2.\nStress increases cardiovascular disease\nas a result of raising blood pressure.\nSo there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss\nthat are more than just a mildly impaired brain,\nwhich is where I think most people think\nthat sleep loss resides."
p1616
aS"\nSo at this point in the talk, this is a nice time to think,\nwell, do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep?\nSo a quick show of hands.\nWho feels that they're getting enough sleep here?\nOh. Well, that's pretty impressive.\nGood. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips."
p1617
aS'\nSo most of us, of course, ask the question,\n"Well, how do I know whether I\'m getting enough sleep?"\nWell, it\'s not rocket science.\nIf you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning,\nif you are taking a long time to get up,\nif you need lots of stimulants,\nif you\'re grumpy, if you\'re irritable,\nif you\'re told by your work colleagues\nthat you\'re looking tired and irritable,\nchances are you are sleep-deprived.\nListen to them. Listen to yourself.'
p1618
aS"\nWhat do you do?\nWell -- and this is slightly offensive --\nsleep for dummies:\nMake your bedroom a haven for sleep.\nThe first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can,\nand also make it slightly cool. Very important.\nActually, reduce your amount of light exposure\nat least half an hour before you go to bed.\nLight increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep.\nWhat's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed?\nWe stand in a massively lit bathroom\nlooking into the mirror cleaning our teeth.\nIt's the worst thing we can possibly do\nbefore we went to sleep.\nTurn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers.\nTurn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain.\nTry not to drink caffeine too late in the day,\nideally not after lunch.\nNow, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed,\nbut light exposure in the morning\nis very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle.\nSo seek out morning light.\nBasically, listen to yourself.\nWind down. Do those sorts of things that you know\nare going to ease you off\ninto the honey-heavy dew of slumber."
p1619
aS"\nOkay. That's some facts. What about some myths?"
p1620
aS'\nTeenagers are lazy. No. Poor things.\nThey have a biological predisposition\nto go to bed late and get up late, so give them a break.'
p1621
aS"\nWe need eight hours of sleep a night.\nThat's an average. Some people need more. Some people need less.\nAnd what you need to do is listen to your body.\nDo you need that much or do you need more?\nSimple as that."
p1622
aS'\nOld people need less sleep. Not true.\nThe sleep demands of the aged do not go down.\nEssentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust,\nbut sleep requirements do not go down.'
p1623
aS"\nAnd the fourth myth is,\nearly to bed, early to rise\nmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\nWell that's wrong at so many different levels.\n(Laughter)\nThere is no, no evidence that getting up early\nand going to bed early gives you more wealth at all.\nThere's no difference in socioeconomic status.\nIn my experience, the only difference between\nmorning people and evening people\nis that those people that get up in the morning early\nare just horribly smug."
p1624
aS'\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p1625
aS'\nOkay. So for the last part, the last few minutes,\nwhat I want to do is change gears\nand talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience,\nwhich is the association between mental health,\nmental illness and sleep disruption.\nWe\'ve known for 130 years that in severe mental illness,\nthere is always, always sleep disruption,\nbut it\'s been largely ignored.\nIn the 1970s, when people started to think about this again,\nthey said, "Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption\nin schizophrenia because they\'re on anti-psychotics.\nIt\'s the anti-psychotics causing the sleep problems,"\nignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously,\nsleep disruption had been reported before anti-psychotics.'
p1626
aS"\nSo what's going on?\nLots of groups, several groups are studying\nconditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar,\nand what's going on in terms of sleep disruption.\nWe have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia,\nand the data were quite extraordinary.\nIn those individuals with schizophrenia,\nmuch of the time, they were awake during the night phase\nand then they were asleep during the day.\nOther groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever.\nTheir sleep was absolutely smashed.\nAnd some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle.\nThey were getting up later and later and later\nand later each night. It was smashed."
p1627
aS"\nSo what's going on?\nAnd the really exciting news is that\nmental illness and sleep are not simply associated\nbut they are physically linked within the brain.\nThe neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep,\ngive you normal sleep, and those that give you\nnormal mental health are overlapping.\nAnd what's the evidence for that?\nWell, genes that have been shown to be very important\nin the generation of normal sleep,\nwhen mutated, when changed,\nalso predispose individuals to mental health problems.\nAnd last year, we published a study\nwhich showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia,\nwhich, when mutated, also smashes the sleep.\nSo we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap\nbetween these two important systems."
p1628
aS"\nOther work flowed from these studies.\nThe first was that sleep disruption actually precedes\ncertain types of mental illness,\nand we've shown that in those young individuals\nwho are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder,\nthey already have a sleep abnormality\nprior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar.\nThe other bit of data was that sleep disruption\nmay actually exacerbate,\nmake worse the mental illness state.\nMy colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents\nwhich have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia\nin those individuals by 50 percent."
p1629
aS"\nSo what have we got?\nWe've got, in these connections, some really exciting things.\nIn terms of the neuroscience, by understanding\nthe neuroscience of these two systems,\nwe're really beginning to understand how both sleep\nand mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain.\nThe second area is that if we can use sleep\nand sleep disruption as an early warning signal,\nthen we have the chance of going in.\nIf we know that these individuals are vulnerable,\nearly intervention then becomes possible.\nAnd the third, which I think is the most exciting,\nis that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain\nas a new therapeutic target.\nStabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable,\nwe can certainly make them healthier,\nbut also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness."
p1630
aS"\nSo let me just finish.\nWhat I started by saying is take sleep seriously.\nOur attitudes toward sleep are so very different\nfrom a pre-industrial age,\nwhen we were almost wrapped in a duvet.\nWe used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep.\nAnd this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense.\nThis is a pragmatic response to good health.\nIf you have good sleep, it increases your concentration,\nattention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health.\nIf you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress,\nyour levels of anger, your impulsivity,\nand your tendency to drink and take drugs.\nAnd we finished by saying\nthat an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep\nis really informing the way we think about\nsome of the causes of mental illness,\nand indeed is providing us new ways\nto treat these incredibly debilitating conditions."

aS"\nThere is movement which is too slow\nfor our eyes to detect,\nand time lapse makes us discover\nand broaden our perspective of life.\nWe can see how organisms emerge and grow,\nhow a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor\nto look at the sunlight.\nAnd at the grand scale,\ntime lapse allows us to see our planet in motion.\nWe can view not only the vast sweep of nature,\nbut the restless movement of humanity.\nEach streaking dot represents a passenger plane,\nand by turning air traffic data\ninto time-lapse imagery,\nwe can see something that's above us constantly\nbut invisible:\nthe vast network of air travel over the United States.\nWe can do the same thing with ships at sea.\nWe can turn data into a time-lapse view\nof a global economy in motion.\nAnd decades of data\ngive us the view of our entire planet\nas a single organism\nsustained by currents circulating\nthroughout the oceans\nand by clouds swirling through the atmosphere,\npulsing with lightning,\ncrowned by the aurora borealis.\nIt may be the ultimate time-lapse image:\nthe anatomy of Earth brought to life."
p1638
aS"\nAt the other extreme,\nthere are things that move too fast for our eyes,\nbut we have technology that can look into that world\nas well.\nWith high-speed cameras,\nwe can do the opposite of time lapse.\nWe can shoot images that are thousands of times\nfaster than our vision.\nAnd we can see how nature's \ningenious devices work,\nand perhaps we can even imitate them.\nWhen a dragonfly flutters by,\nyou may not realize,\nbut it's the greatest flier in nature.\nIt can hover, fly backwards,\neven upside down.\nAnd by tracking markers on an insect's wings,\nwe can visualize the air flow that they produce.\nNobody knew the secret,\nbut high speed shows that a dragonfly\ncan move all four wings in different directions\nat the same time.\nAnd what we learn can lead us\nto new kinds of robotic flyers\nthat can expand our vision\nof important and remote places."

I feel really --\nI\'m not functioning."\nAnd she said, "What\'s going on?"\nAnd I said, "I just told\n500 people\nthat I became a researcher\nto avoid vulnerability.\nAnd that when being vulnerable\nemerged from my data,\nas absolutely essential\nto whole-hearted living,\nI told these 500 people\nthat I had a breakdown.\nI had a slide that said Breakdown.\nAt what point did I think that was a good idea?"\n(Laughter)'
p1648
aS'\nAnd she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.\nIt was not really you.\nIt was a little different than what you usually do.\nBut it was great."\nAnd I said,\n"This can\'t happen.\nYouTube, they\'re putting this thing on YouTube.\nAnd we\'re going to be talking about 600, 700 people."\n(Laughter)\nAnd she said, "Well, I think it\'s too late."'
p1649
aS'\nAnd I said, "Let me ask you something."\nAnd she said, "Yeah."\nAnd I said, "Do you remember when we were in college\nand really wild and kind of dumb?"\nAnd she said, "Yeah."\nAnd I said, "Remember when we\'d leave a really bad message\non our ex-boyfriend\'s answering machine?\nThen we\'d have to break into his dorm room\nand then erase the tape?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd she goes, "Uh ... no."\n(Laughter)\nSo of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was,\n"Yeah, me neither.\nThat ... me neither."'
p1650
aS'\nAnd I\'m thinking to myself,\n"Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?\nWhy did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?\nYour sisters would be perfect for this."\nSo I looked back up and she said,\n"Are you really going to try to break in\nand steal the video\nbefore they put it on YouTube?"\nAnd I said, "I\'m just thinking about it a little bit."\n(Laughter)\nShe said, "You\'re like the worst vulnerability role model ever."\n(Laughter)\nAnd then I looked at her and I said something\nthat at the time felt a little dramatic,\nbut ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.\nI said,\n"If 500 turns into 1,000\nor 2,000,\nmy life is over."\n(Laughter)\nI had no contingency plan for four million.'
p1651
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1652
aS"\nAnd my life did end when that happened.\nAnd maybe the hardest part about my life ending\nis that I learned something hard about myself,\nand that was that,\nas much as I would frustrated\nabout not being able to get my work out to the world,\nthere was a part of me that was working very hard\nto engineer staying small,\nstaying right under the radar.\nBut I want to talk about what I've learned."
p1653
aS'\nThere\'s two things that I\'ve learned in the last year.\nThe first is\nvulnerability is not weakness.\nAnd that myth\nis profoundly dangerous.\nLet me ask you honestly --\nand I\'ll give you this warning,\nI\'m trained as a therapist,\nso I can out-wait you uncomfortably --\nso if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome --\nhow many of you honestly,\nwhen you\'re thinking about doing something vulnerable\nor saying something vulnerable,\nthink, "God, vulnerability\'s weakness. This is weakness?"\nHow many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?\nThe majority of people.\nNow let me ask you this question:\nThis past week at TED,\nhow many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here,\nthought it was pure courage?\nVulnerability is not weakness.\nI define vulnerability\nas emotional risk,\nexposure, uncertainty.\nIt fuels our daily lives.\nAnd I\'ve come to the belief --\nthis is my 12th year doing this research --\nthat vulnerability\nis our most accurate measurement\nof courage --\nto be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen,\nto be honest.'
p1654
aS'\nOne of the weird things that\'s happened\nis, after the TED explosion,\nI got a lot of offers to speak all over the country --\neveryone from schools and parent meetings\nto Fortune 500 companies.\nAnd so many of the calls went like this,\n"Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.\nWe\'d like you to come in and speak.\nWe\'d appreciate it\nif you wouldn\'t mention vulnerability or shame."\n(Laughter)\nWhat would you like for me to talk about?\nThere\'s three big answers.\nThis is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector:\ninnovation, creativity\nand change.\nSo let me go on the record\nand say,\nvulnerability is the birthplace\nof innovation, creativity and change.\n(Applause)\nTo create is to make something\nthat has never existed before.\nThere\'s nothing more vulnerable than that.\nAdaptability to change\nis all about vulnerability.'
p1655
aS'\nThe second thing,\nin addition to really finally understanding\nthe relationship between vulnerability and courage,\nthe second thing I learned is this:\nWe have to talk about shame.\nAnd I\'m going to be really honest with you.\nWhen I became a "vulnerability researcher"\nand that became the focus because of the TEDTalk --\nand I\'m not kidding.'
p1656
aS'\nI\'ll give you an example.\nAbout three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store\nbuying goggles and shin guards\nand all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.\nAbout from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear:\n"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"\n(Laughter)\nI\'m a fifth generation Texan.\nOur family motto is "Lock and load."\nI am not a natural vulnerability researcher.\nSo I\'m like,\njust keep walking, she\'s on my six.\n(Laughter)\nAnd then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"\nI turn around, I go, "Hi."\nShe\'s right here and she said,\n"You\'re the shame researcher who had the breakdown."\n(Laughter)\nAt this point\nparents are, like, pulling their children close.\n"Look away."\nAnd I\'m so worn out at this point in my life,\nI look at her and I actually say,\n"It was a frickin\' spiritual awakening."'
p1657
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1658
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1659
aS'\nAnd she looks back and does this,\n"I know."\nAnd she said,\n"We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.\nThen we read your book\nand we renamed ourselves\n\'The Breakdown Babes.\'"\nAnd she said, "Our tagline is:\n\'We\'re falling apart and it feels fantastic.\'"\n(Laughter)\nYou can only imagine\nwhat it\'s like for me in a faculty meeting.'
p1660
aS'\nSo when I became Vulnerability TED,\nlike an action figure --\nlike Ninja Barbie, but I\'m Vulnerability TED --\nI thought, I\'m going to leave that shame stuff behind,\nbecause I spent six years studying shame\nbefore I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.\nAnd I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic,\nno one wants to talk about it.\nIt\'s the best way to shut people down on an airplane.\n"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."\n(Laughter)\nAnd I see you.\n(Laughter)'
p1661
aS"\nBut in surviving this last year,\nI was reminded of a cardinal rule --\nnot a research rule,\nbut a moral imperative\nfrom my upbringing --\nyou've got to dance with the one who brung ya.\nAnd I did not learn about vulnerability\nand courage and creativity and innovation\nfrom studying vulnerability.\nI learned about these things\nfrom studying shame.\nAnd so I want to walk you in\nto shame.\nJungian analysts call shame\nthe swampland of the soul.\nAnd we're going to walk in.\nAnd the purpose is not to walk in\nand construct a home and live there.\nIt is to put on some galoshes\nand walk through and find our way around.\nHere's why."
p1662
aS"\nWe heard the most compelling call ever\nto have a conversation in this country,\nand I think globally,\naround race, right?\nYes? We heard that.\nYes?\nCannot have that conversation without shame,\nbecause you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.\nAnd when people start talking about privilege,\nthey get paralyzed by shame.\nWe heard a brilliant simple solution\nto not killing people in surgery,\nwhich is have a checklist.\nYou can't fix that problem without addressing shame,\nbecause when they teach those folks how to suture,\nthey also teach them how to stitch their self-worth\nto being all-powerful.\nAnd all-powerful folks don't need checklists."
p1663
aS'\nAnd I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow\nso I didn\'t mess it up here.\nMyshkin Ingawale,\nI hope I did right by you.\n(Applause)\nI saw the TED Fellows my first day here.\nAnd he got up and he explained\nhow he was driven to create\nsome technology to help test for anemia\nbecause people were dying unnecessarily.\nAnd he said, "I saw this need.\nSo you know what I did? I made it."\nAnd everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"\nAnd he said, "And it didn\'t work.\nAnd then I made it 32 more times,\nand then it worked."'
p1664
aS"\nYou know what the big secret about TED is?\nI can't wait to tell people this.\nI guess I'm doing it right now.\n(Laughter)\nThis is like the failure conference.\nNo, it is.\n(Applause)\nYou know why this place is amazing?\nBecause very few people here\nare afraid to fail.\nAnd no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.\nI've failed miserably, many times.\nI don't think the world understands that\nbecause of shame."
p1665
aS'\nThere\'s a great quote that saved me this past year\nby Theodore Roosevelt.\nA lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.\nAnd it goes like this:\n"It is not the critic who counts.\nIt is not the man who sits and points out\nhow the doer of deeds could have done things better\nand how he falls and stumbles.\nThe credit goes to the man in the arena\nwhose face is marred\nwith dust and blood and sweat.\nBut when he\'s in the arena,\nat best he wins,\nand at worst he loses,\nbut when he fails, when he loses,\nhe does so daring greatly."'
p1666
aS'\nAnd that\'s what this conference, to me, is about.\nThat\'s what life is about, about daring greatly,\nabout being in the arena.\nWhen you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door,\nand you think, "I\'m going in and I\'m going to try this,"\nshame is the gremlin\nwho says, "Uh, uh.\nYou\'re not good enough.\nYou never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.\nI know your dad really wasn\'t in Luxembourg,\nhe was in Sing Sing.\nI know those things that happened to you growing up.\nI know you don\'t think that you\'re pretty enough\nor smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.\nI know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."\nShame is that thing.'
p1667
aS'\nAnd if we can quiet it down and walk in\nand say, "I\'m going to do this,"\nwe look up and the critic that we see\npointing and laughing,\n99 percent of the time is who?\nUs.\nShame drives two big tapes --\n"never good enough"\nand, if you can talk it out of that one,\n"who do you think you are?"\nThe thing to understand about shame is it\'s not guilt.\nShame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.\nShame is "I am bad."\nGuilt is "I did something bad."\nHow many of you,\nif you did something that was hurtful to me,\nwould be willing to say, "I\'m sorry. I made a mistake?"\nHow many of you would be willing to say that?\nGuilt: I\'m sorry. I made a mistake.\nShame: I\'m sorry. I am a mistake.'
p1668
aS"\nThere's a huge difference between shame and guilt.\nAnd here's what you need to know.\nShame is highly, highly correlated\nwith addiction, depression, violence, aggression,\nbullying, suicide, eating disorders.\nAnd here's what you even need to know more.\nGuilt, inversely correlated with those things.\nThe ability to hold something we've done or failed to do\nup against who we want to be\nis incredibly adaptive.\nIt's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive."
p1669
aS"\nThe other thing you need to know about shame\nis it's absolutely organized by gender.\nIf shame washes over me and washes over Chris,\nit's going to feel the same.\nEveryone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.\nWe're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame\nare people who have no capacity\nfor connection or empathy.\nWhich means, yes, I have a little shame;\nno, I'm a sociopath.\nSo I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.\nShame feels the same for men and women,\nbut it's organized by gender."
p1670
aS'\nFor women,\nthe best example I can give you\nis Enjoli\nthe commercial:\n"I can put the wash on the line,\npack the lunches, hand out the kisses\nand be at work at five to nine.\nI can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan\nand never let you forget you\'re a man."\nFor women, shame is do it all,\ndo it perfectly\nand never let them see you sweat.\nI don\'t know how much perfume that commercial sold,\nbut I guarantee you,\nit moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.\n(Laughter)\nShame, for women, is this web\nof unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations\nabout who we\'re supposed to be.\nAnd it\'s a straight-jacket.'
p1671
aS'\nFor men,\nshame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.\nShame is one,\ndo not be perceived as what?\nWeak.\nI did not interview men for the first four years of my study.\nAnd it wasn\'t until a man looked at me one day after a book signing,\nsaid, "I love what you have to say about shame,\nI\'m curious why you didn\'t mention men."\nAnd I said, "I don\'t study men."\nAnd he said, "That\'s convenient."\n(Laughter)\nAnd I said, "Why?"\nAnd he said, "Because you say to reach out,\ntell our story,\nbe vulnerable.\nBut you see those books you just signed\nfor my wife and my three daughters?"\nI said, "Yeah."\n"They\'d rather me die on top of my white horse\nthan watch me fall down.\nWhen we reach out and be vulnerable\nwe get the shit beat out of us.\nAnd don\'t tell me\nit\'s from the guys and the coaches and the dads,\nbecause the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."'
p1672
aS'\nSo I started interviewing men\nand asking questions.\nAnd what I learned is this:\nYou show me a woman who can actually sit with a man\nin real vulnerability and fear,\nI\'ll show you a woman who\'s done incredible work.\nYou show me a man who can sit with a woman\nwho\'s just had it,\nshe can\'t do it all anymore,\nand his first response is not,\n"I unloaded the dishwasher,"\nbut he really listens --\nbecause that\'s all we need --\nI\'ll show you a guy who\'s done a lot of work.'
p1673
aS"\nShame is an epidemic in our culture.\nAnd to get out from underneath it,\nto find our way back to each other,\nwe have to understand how it affects us\nand how it affects the way we're parenting,\nthe way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.\nVery quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.\nHe asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?\nThe top answers in this country:\nnice, thin, modest\nand use all available resources for appearance.\nWhen he asked about men,\nwhat do men in this country need to do\nto conform with male norms,\nthe answers were:\nalways show emotional control, work is first,\npursue status and violence."
p1674
aS"\nIf we're going to find our way back to each other,\nwe have to understand and know empathy,\nbecause empathy's the antidote to shame.\nIf you put shame in a Petri dish,\nit needs three things to grow exponentially:\nsecrecy, silence and judgment.\nIf you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy,\nit can't survive.\nThe two most powerful words when we're in struggle:\nme too."
p1675
aS"\nAnd so I'll leave you with this thought.\nIf we're going to find our way\nback to each other,\nvulnerability is going to be that path.\nAnd I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena,\nbecause I think I did it my whole life,\nand think to myself,\nI'm going to go in there and kick some ass\nwhen I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.\nAnd that is seductive.\nBut the truth is that never happens.\nAnd even if you got as perfect as you could\nand as bulletproof as you could possibly muster\nwhen you got in there,\nthat's not what we want to see.\nWe want you to go in.\nWe want to be with you and across from you.\nAnd we just want,\nfor ourselves and the people we care about\nand the people we work with,\nto dare greatly."
p1676
aS'\nSo thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.'
p1677
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1678
aa(lp1679
S'\nSo, I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find\nCoca-Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.\n(Laughter)\nAnd so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas to your kind invitation.\nSo I would like to invite you, also, for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.\nAnd to show the place where meditators, like me,\nwho began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute,\nand found their way to the mountains.'
p1680
aS'\nSo these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there.\nThere\'s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.\nThis is from Marlboro country.\n(Laughter)\nThis is a turquoise lake.\nA meditator.\nThis is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.\nAnd the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said,\n"We are going to sleep outside." And I said, "Why? We have enough space in the tent."\nThey said, "Yes, but it\'s summertime."\n(Laughter)'
p1681
aS'\nSo now, we are going to speak of happiness.\nAs a Frenchman, I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals\nthat think happiness is not at all interesting.\n(Laughter)\nI just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy.\nAnd someone wrote an article saying, "Don\'t impose on us the dirty work of happiness."\n(Laughter)\n"We don\'t care about being happy. We need to live with passion.\nWe like the ups and downs of life.\nWe like our suffering because it\'s so good when it ceases for a while."\n(Laughter)'
p1682
aS"\nThis is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.\nIt's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.\n(Laughter)"
p1683
aS'\nNow, let\'s come to happiness or well-being.\nAnd first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say,\nit seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking,\n"May I suffer the whole day?"\n(Laughter)\nWhich means that somehow -- consciously or not,\ndirectly or indirectly, in the short or the long term,\nwhatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream --\nsomehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness.\nAs Pascal said, even the one who hangs himself,\nsomehow, is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way.\nBut then, if you look in the literature, East and West,\nyou can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness.\nSome people say, I only believed in remembering the past,\nimagining the future, never the present.\nSome people say happiness is right now;\nit\'s the quality of the freshness of the present moment.\nAnd that led to Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, to say,\n"All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague\nso that they could define -- each of them could define their own terms."'
p1684
aS"\nWell, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.\nBut now, if it is something that is going to determine\nthe quality of every instant of our life,\nthen we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.\nAnd probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often,\nalthough we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.\nAlthough we want to avoid suffering, it seems we are running somewhat towards it.\nAnd that can also come from some kind of confusions."
p1685
aS"\nOne of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure.\nBut, if you look at the characteristics of those two,\npleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object, upon the place.\nIt is something that -- changes of nature.\nBeautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious,\nsecond one not so much, then we feel disgust.\n(Laughter)\nThat's the nature of things. We get tired.\nI used to be a fan of Bach. I used to play it on the guitar, you know.\nI can hear it two, three, five times.\nIf I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.\nIf you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.\nThen, after some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning.\nIt sort of uses itself as you experience it.\nAnd also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you --\nit is not something that is radiating outside.\nLike, you can feel intense pleasure\nand some others around you can be suffering a lot."
p1686
aS"\nNow, what, then, will be happiness?\nAnd happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being.\nAnd so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view,\nis that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation.\nIt is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment,\na state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states,\nand all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way.\nFor you, that might be surprising.\nCan we have this kind of well-being while being sad? In a way, why not?\nBecause we are speaking of a different level."
p1687
aS"\nLook at the waves coming here to shore.\nWhen you are at the bottom of the wave, you hit the bottom.\nYou hit the solid rock.\nWhen you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.\nSo you go from elation to depression -- there's no depth.\nNow, if you look at the high sea, there might be beautiful, calm ocean, like a mirror.\nThere might be storms, but the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged.\nSo now, how is that?\nIt can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.\nEven joy -- that can be the spring of happiness.\nBut there's also wicked joy, you can rejoice in someone's suffering."
p1688
aS'\nSo how do we proceed in our quest for happiness? Very often, we look outside.\nWe think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions,\nsomething that we say, "Everything to be happy --\nto have everything to be happy."\nThat very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness.\nTo have everything. If we miss something, it collapses.\nAnd also, when things go wrong, we try to fix the outside so much,\nbut our control of the outer world is limited, temporary, and often, illusory.\nSo now, look at inner conditions. Aren\'t they stronger?\nIsn\'t it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering?\nAnd isn\'t that stronger?\nWe know, by experience, that we can be what we call "a little paradise,"\nand yet, be completely unhappy within.'
p1689
aS'\nThe Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,\nand there was a lot of construction going on everywhere.\nSo one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things,\nbut isn\'t it nice, also, to build something within?"\nAnd he said, "Unless that -- even you get high-tech flat\non the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building,\nif you are deeply unhappy within,\nall you are going to look for is a window from which to jump."\nSo now, at the opposite,\nwe know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances,\nmanage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence.\nSo now, if the inner conditions are stronger --\nof course, the outer conditions do influence,\nand it\'s wonderful to live longer, healthier,\nto have access to information, education, to be able to travel,\nto have freedom. It\'s highly desirable.\nHowever, this is not enough. Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.\nThe experience that translates everything is within the mind.\nSo then, when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness,\nthe inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness.\nSo then, this just needs to have some experience.'
p1690
aS"\nWe have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind\nthat are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being,\nwhat the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing.\nThere are some which are adverse to this well-being.\nAnd so, if we look from our own experience,\nanger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance, obsessive desire, strong grasping,\nthey don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it.\nAnd also, they are detrimental to others' happiness.\nSo we may consider that the more those are invading our mind,\nand, like a chain reaction, the more we feel miserable, we feel tormented.\nAt the opposite, everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity,\nif from the distance, without anyone knowing anything about it,\nwe could save a child's life, make someone happy.\nWe don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude.\nJust the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature.\nAnd we would like to be like that all the time."
p1691
aS"\nSo is that possible, to change our way of being, to transform one's mind?\nAren't those negative emotions, or destructive emotions,\ninherent to the nature of mind?\nIs change possible in our emotions, in our traits, in our moods?\nFor that we have to ask, what is nature of mind?\nAnd if we look from the experiential point of view,\nthere is a primary quality of consciousness\nthat's just the mere fact to be cognitive, to be aware.\nConsciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.\nYou can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror.\nThe mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted,\nis not modified, is not altered by those images.\nLikewise, behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness, pure awareness.\nThis is the nature. It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because,\nthen, if it was always there -- like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth --\nthen it would be found all the time, somewhere.\nWe know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous."
p1692
aS"\nSo, because the basic fabric of consciousness\nis this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone,\nthere is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting.\nThat is the ground for mind training.\nMind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors\ncannot happen at the same time.\nYou could go from love to hate.\nBut you cannot, at the same time, toward the same object,\nthe same person, want to harm and want to do good.\nYou cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow.\nSo, there are natural antidotes to emotions\nthat are destructive to our inner well-being.\nSo that's the way to proceed. Rejoicing compared to jealousy.\nA kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession.\nBenevolence, loving kindness against hatred.\nBut, of course, each emotion then would need a particular antidote."
p1693
aS"\nAnother way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions,\nand that's by looking at the very nature.\nUsually, when we feel annoyed, hatred or upset with someone,\nor obsessed with something, the mind goes again and again to that object.\nEach time it goes to the object, it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance.\nSo then, it's a self-perpetuating process.\nSo what we need to look now is, instead of looking outward, we look inward.\nLook at anger itself.\nIt looks very menacing, like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.\nBut we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there, it's just mist.\nLikewise, if you look at the thought of anger,\nit will vanish like frost under the morning sun.\nIf you do this again and again, the propensity,\nthe tendencies for anger to arise again\nwill be less and less each time you dissolve it.\nAnd, at the end, although it may rise, it will just cross the mind,\nlike a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track.\nSo this is the principal of mind training."
p1694
aS"\nNow, it takes time because we -- it took time for all those faults in our mind,\nthe tendencies, to build up, so it will take time to unfold them as well.\nBut that's the only way to go.\nMind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation.\nIt means familiarization with a new way of being,\nnew way of perceiving things, which is more in adequation with reality,\nwith interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation,\nwhich our being and our consciousness is."
p1695
aS'\nSo, the interface with cognitive science,\nsince we need to come to that, and it was, I suppose, the subject of --\nwe have to deal in such a short time\nwith brain plasticity. The brain was thought to be more or less fixed.\nAll the nominal connections, in numbers and quantities, were thought --\nuntil the last 20 years -- thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age.\nNow, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.\nA violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice,\nsome area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot,\nincreasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.\nSo can we do that with human qualities?\nWith loving kindness, with patience, with openness?'
p1696
aS"\nSo that's what those great meditators have been doing.\nSome of them who came to the labs, like in Madison, Wisconsin, or in Berkeley,\ndid 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.\nThey do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.\nAnd then, the rest of their life, they will do that three or four hours a day.\nThey are real Olympic champions of mind training.\n(Laughter)\nThis is the place where the meditators -- you can see it's kind of inspiring.\nNow, here with 256 electrodes.\n(Laughter)"
p1697
aS'\nSo what did they find? Of course, same thing.\nThe scientific embargo -- if ever has been to submitted to "Nature,"\nhopefully, it will be accepted.\nIt deals with the state of compassion, unconditional compassion.\nWe asked meditators, who have been doing that for years and years and years,\nto put their mind in a state where there\'s nothing but loving kindness,\ntotal availability to sentient being.\nOf course, during the training, we do that with objects.\nWe think of people suffering, we think of people we love,\nbut at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.\nHere is the preliminary result, which I can show because it\'s already been shown.\nThe bell curve shows 150 controls, and what is being looked at\nis the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.\nIn very short, people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex\nare more depressed, withdrawn. They don\'t describe a lot of positive affect.\nIt\'s the opposite on the left side: more tendency to altruism,\nto happiness, to express, and curiosity and so forth.\nSo there\'s a basic line for people. And also, it can be changed.\nIf you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side.\nIf you are happy about something, you\'ll go more to the left side.\nIf you have a bout of depression, you\'ll go to the right side.\nHere, the -0.5 is the full standard deviation\nof a meditator who meditated on compassion.\nIt\'s something that is totally out of the bell curve.'
p1698
aS"\nSo, I've no time to go into all the different scientific results.\nHopefully, they will come.\nBut they found that -- this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI,\nit's like coming out of a space ship.\nAlso, it has been shown in other labs --\nfor instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --\nthat some meditators are able, also,\nto control their emotional response more than it could be thought.\nLike the startle experiments, for example.\nIf you sit a guy on a chair with all this kind of apparatus measuring your physiology,\nand there's kind of a bomb that goes off, it's so instinctive response that,\nin 20 years, they never saw anyone who will not jump.\nSome meditators, without trying to stop it,\nbut simply by being completely open,\nthinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star,\nthey are able not to move at all."
p1699
aS"\nSo the whole point of that is not, sort of, to make, like,\na circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump, or whatever.\nIt's more to say that mind training matters. That this is not just a luxury.\nThis is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.\nThis is something that's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives.\nWe are ready to spend 15 years achieving education.\nWe love to do jogging, fitness.\nWe do all kinds of things to remain beautiful.\nYet, we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most --\nthe way our mind functions --\nwhich, again, is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience."
p1700
aS"\nNow, our compassion is supposed to be put in action.\nThat's what we try to do in different places.\nJust this one example is worth a lot of work.\nThis lady with bone TB, left alone in a tent, is going to die with her only daughter.\nOne year later, how she is.\nDifferent schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet."

aa(lp1703
S"\nFirst, a video.\n(Video) Yes, it is a scrambled egg.\nBut as you look at it,\nI hope you'll begin to feel\njust slightly uneasy.\nBecause you may notice that what's actually happening\nis that the egg is unscrambling itself.\nAnd you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated.\nAnd now they're going to be poured back into the egg.\nAnd we all know in our heart of hearts\nthat this is not the way the universe works.\nA scrambled egg is mush -- tasty mush -- but it's mush.\nAn egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing\nthat can create even more sophisticated things,\nsuch as chickens.\nAnd we know in our heart of hearts\nthat the universe does not travel\nfrom mush to complexity.\nIn fact, this gut instinct\nis reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics,\nthe second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy.\nWhat that says basically\nis that the general tendency of the universe\nis to move from order\nand structure\nto lack of order, lack of structure --\nin fact, to mush.\nAnd that's why that video\nfeels a bit strange."
p1704
aS"\nAnd yet,\nlook around us.\nWhat we see around us\nis staggering complexity.\nEric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone,\nthere are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.\nThat's hundreds of times as many species\nas there are on Earth.\nAnd they're being traded by a species\nof almost seven billion individuals,\nwho are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet\ninto a global system\nof stupendous complexity."
p1705
aS'\nSo here\'s a great puzzle:\nin a universe\nruled by the second law of thermodynamics,\nhow is it possible\nto generate the sort of complexity I\'ve described,\nthe sort of complexity represented by you and me\nand the convention center?\nWell, the answer seems to be,\nthe universe can create complexity,\nbut with great difficulty.\nIn pockets,\nthere appear what my colleague, Fred Spier,\ncalls "Goldilocks conditions" --\nnot too hot, not too cold,\njust right for the creation of complexity.\nAnd slightly more complex things appear.\nAnd where you have slightly more complex things,\nyou can get slightly more complex things.\nAnd in this way, complexity builds\nstage by stage.\nEach stage is magical\nbecause it creates the impression of something utterly new\nappearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.\nWe refer in big history to these moments\nas threshold moments.\nAnd at each threshold,\nthe going gets tougher.\nThe complex things get more fragile,\nmore vulnerable;\nthe Goldilocks conditions get more stringent,\nand it\'s more difficult\nto create complexity.'
p1706
aS"\nNow, we, as extremely complex creatures,\ndesperately need to know this story\nof how the universe creates complexity\ndespite the second law,\nand why complexity\nmeans vulnerability\nand fragility.\nAnd that's the story that we tell in big history.\nBut to do it, you have do something\nthat may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.\nYou have to survey the whole history of the universe.\nSo let's do it.\n(Laughter)\nLet's begin by winding the timeline back\n13.7 billion years,\nto the beginning of time."
p1707
aS"\nAround us, there's nothing.\nThere's not even time or space.\nImagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can\nand cube it a gazillion times\nand that's where we are.\nAnd then suddenly,\nbang! A universe appears, an entire universe.\nAnd we've crossed our first threshold.\nThe universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.\nIt's incredibly hot.\nIt contains everything that's in today's universe,\nso you can imagine, it's busting.\nAnd it's expanding at incredible speed.\nAnd at first, it's just a blur,\nbut very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.\nWithin the first second,\nenergy itself shatters into distinct forces\nincluding electromagnetism and gravity.\nAnd energy does something else quite magical:\nit congeals to form matter --\nquarks that will create protons\nand leptons that include electrons.\nAnd all of that happens in the first second."
p1708
aS"\nNow we move forward 380,000 years.\nThat's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.\nAnd now simple atoms appear\nof hydrogen and helium.\nNow I want to pause for a moment,\n380,000 years after the origins of the universe,\nbecause we actually know quite a lot\nabout the universe at this stage.\nWe know above all that it was extremely simple.\nIt consisted of huge clouds\nof hydrogen and helium atoms,\nand they have no structure.\nThey're really a sort of cosmic mush.\nBut that's not completely true.\nRecent studies\nby satellites such as the WMAP satellite\nhave shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background.\nWhat you see here,\nthe blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler\nthan the red areas.\nThese are tiny differences,\nbut it was enough for the universe to move on\nto the next stage of building complexity."
p1709
aS"\nAnd this is how it works.\nGravity is more powerful\nwhere there's more stuff.\nSo where you get slightly denser areas,\ngravity starts compacting clouds\nof hydrogen and helium atoms.\nSo we can imagine the early universe breaking up\ninto a billion clouds.\nAnd each cloud is compacted,\ngravity gets more powerful as density increases,\nthe temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud,\nand then, at the center of each cloud,\nthe temperature crosses the threshold temperature\nof 10 million degrees,\nprotons start to fuse,\nthere's a huge release of energy,\nand, bam!\nWe have our first stars.\nFrom about 200 million years after the Big Bang,\nstars begin to appear all through the universe,\nbillions of them.\nAnd the universe is now significantly more interesting\nand more complex."
p1710
aS"\nStars will create the Goldilocks conditions\nfor crossing two new thresholds.\nWhen very large stars die,\nthey create temperatures so high\nthat protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations,\nto form all the elements of the periodic table.\nIf, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,\nit was forged in a supernova explosion.\nSo now the universe is chemically more complex.\nAnd in a chemically more complex universe,\nit's possible to make more things.\nAnd what starts happening\nis that, around young suns,\nyoung stars,\nall these elements combine, they swirl around,\nthe energy of the star stirs them around,\nthey form particles, they form snowflakes,\nthey form little dust motes,\nthey form rocks, they form asteroids,\nand eventually, they form planets and moons.\nAnd that is how our solar system was formed,\nfour and a half billion years ago.\nRocky planets like our Earth\nare significantly more complex than stars\nbecause they contain a much greater diversity of materials.\nSo we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity."
p1711
aS"\nNow, the going gets tougher.\nThe next stage introduces entities\nthat are significantly more fragile,\nsignificantly more vulnerable,\nbut they're also much more creative\nand much more capable of generating further complexity.\nI'm talking, of course,\nabout living organisms.\nLiving organisms are created by chemistry.\nWe are huge packages of chemicals.\nSo, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.\nThat operates over smaller scales than gravity,\nwhich explains why you and I\nare smaller than stars or planets.\nNow, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?\nWhat are the Goldilocks conditions?\nWell, first, you need energy,\nbut not too much.\nIn the center of a star, there's so much energy\nthat any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.\nBut not too little.\nIn intergalactic space, there's so little energy\nthat atoms can't combine.\nWhat you want is just the right amount,\nand planets, it turns out, are just right,\nbecause they're close to stars, but not too close."
p1712
aS"\nYou also need a great diversity of chemical elements,\nand you need liquid such as water.\nWhy?\nWell, in gasses, atoms move past each other so fast\nthat they can't hitch up.\nIn solids,\natoms are stuck together, they can't move.\nIn liquids,\nthey can cruise and cuddle\nand link up to form molecules.\nNow, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions?\nWell, planets are great,\nand our early Earth\nwas almost perfect.\nIt was just the right distance from its star\nto contain huge oceans of open water.\nAnd deep beneath those oceans,\nat cracks in the Earth's crust,\nyou've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth,\nand you've got a great diversity of elements.\nSo at those deep oceanic vents,\nfantastic chemistry began to happen,\nand atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations."
p1713
aS"\nBut of course, life is more\nthan just exotic chemistry.\nHow do you stabilize\nthose huge molecules\nthat seem to be viable?\nWell, it's here that life introduces\nan entirely new trick.\nYou don't stabilize the individual;\nyou stabilize the template,\nthe thing that carries information,\nand you allow the template to copy itself.\nAnd DNA, of course,\nis the beautiful molecule\nthat contains that information.\nYou'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.\nEach rung contains information.\nSo, DNA contains information\nabout how to make living organisms.\nAnd DNA also copies itself.\nSo, it copies itself\nand scatters the templates through the ocean.\nSo the information spreads.\nNotice that information has become part of our story.\nThe real beauty of DNA though\nis in its imperfections.\nAs it copies itself,\nonce in every billion rungs,\nthere tends to be an error.\nAnd what that means\nis that DNA is, in effect, learning.\nIt's accumulating new ways of making living organisms\nbecause some of those errors work.\nSo DNA's learning\nand it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.\nAnd we can see this happening over the last four billion years."
p1714
aS'\nFor most of that time of life on Earth,\nliving organisms have been relatively simple --\nsingle cells.\nBut they had great diversity,\nand, inside, great complexity.\nThen from about 600 to 800 million years ago,\nmulti-celled organisms appear.\nYou get fungi, you get fish,\nyou get plants,\nyou get amphibia, you get reptiles,\nand then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.\nAnd occasionally, there are disasters.\nSixty-five million years ago,\nan asteroid landed on Earth\nnear the Yucatan Peninsula,\ncreating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war,\nand the dinosaurs were wiped out.\nTerrible news for the dinosaurs,\nbut great news for our mammalian ancestors,\nwho flourished\nin the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.\nAnd we human beings\nare part of that creative evolutionary pulse\nthat began 65 million years ago\nwith the landing of an asteroid.'
p1715
aS"\nHumans appeared about 200,000 years ago.\nAnd I believe we count\nas a threshold in this great story.\nLet me explain why.\nWe've seen that DNA learns in a sense,\nit accumulates information.\nBut it is so slow.\nDNA accumulates information\nthrough random errors,\nsome of which just happen to work.\nBut DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning:\nit had produced organisms with brains,\nand those organisms can learn in real time.\nThey accumulate information, they learn.\nThe sad thing is,\nwhen they die, the information dies with them.\nNow what makes humans different\nis human language.\nWe are blessed with a language, a system of communication,\nso powerful and so precise\nthat we can share what we've learned with such precision\nthat it can accumulate in the collective memory.\nAnd that means\nit can outlast the individuals who learned that information,\nand it can accumulate from generation to generation.\nAnd that's why, as a species, we're so creative\nand so powerful,\nand that's why we have a history.\nWe seem to be the only species in four billion years\nto have this gift."
p1716
aS"\nI call this ability\ncollective learning.\nIt's what makes us different.\nWe can see it at work\nin the earliest stages of human history.\nWe evolved as a species\nin the savanna lands of Africa,\nbut then you see humans migrating into new environments,\ninto desert lands, into jungles,\ninto the ice age tundra of Siberia --\ntough, tough environment --\ninto the Americas, into Australasia.\nEach migration involved learning --\nlearning new ways of exploiting the environment,\nnew ways of dealing with their surroundings."
p1717
aS"\nThen 10,000 years ago,\nexploiting a sudden change in global climate\nwith the end of the last ice age,\nhumans learned to farm.\nFarming was an energy bonanza.\nAnd exploiting that energy,\nhuman populations multiplied.\nHuman societies got larger, denser,\nmore interconnected.\nAnd then from about 500 years ago,\nhumans began to link up globally\nthrough shipping, through trains,\nthrough telegraph, through the Internet,\nuntil now we seem to form\na single global brain\nof almost seven billion individuals.\nAnd that brain is learning at warp speed.\nAnd in the last 200 years, something else has happened.\nWe've stumbled on another energy bonanza\nin fossil fuels.\nSo fossil fuels and collective learning together\nexplain the staggering complexity\nwe see around us."
p1718
aS"\nSo, here we are,\nback at the convention center.\nWe've been on a journey, a return journey,\nof 13.7 billion years.\nI hope you agree that this is a powerful story.\nAnd it's a story in which humans\nplay an astonishing and creative role.\nBut it also contains warnings.\nCollective learning is a very, very powerful force,\nand it's not clear\nthat we humans are in charge of it.\nI remember very vividly as a child growing up in England,\nliving through the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nFor a few days,\nthe entire biosphere\nseemed to be on the verge of destruction.\nAnd the same weapons are still here,\nand they are still armed.\nIf we avoid that trap,\nothers are waiting for us.\nWe're burning fossil fuels at such a rate\nthat we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions\nthat made it possible for human civilizations\nto flourish over the last 10,000 years.\nSo what big history can do\nis show us the nature of our complexity and fragility\nand the dangers that face us,\nbut it can also show us\nour power with collective learning."
p1719
aS"\nAnd now, finally,\nthis is what I want.\nI want my grandson, Daniel,\nand his friends and his generation,\nthroughout the world,\nto know the story of big history,\nand to know it so well\nthat they understand\nboth the challenges that face us\nand the opportunities that face us.\nAnd that's why a group of us\nare building a free, online syllabus\nin big history\nfor high school students throughout the world.\nWe believe that big history\nwill be a vital intellectual tool for them,\nas Daniel and his generation\nface the huge challenges\nand also the huge opportunities\nahead of them at this threshold moment\nin the history of our beautiful planet."

p1724
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1725
aS'\nNow I know that seems ludicrous.\nI know that seems ludicrous.\nAnd believe me, I lived the same sad life\nuntil about three years ago.\nAnd what happened to me\nwas I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes.\nBut those shoes came with round nylon laces,\nand I couldn\'t keep them tied.\nSo I went back to the store and said to the owner,\n"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."\nHe took a look and said, "Oh, you\'re tying them wrong."\nNow up until that moment,\nI would have thought that, by age 50,\none of the life skills that I had really nailed\nwas tying my shoes.\nBut not so -- let me demonstrate.'
p1726
aS"\nThis is the way\nthat most of us were taught to tie our shoes.\nNow as it turns out -- thank you.\nWait, there's more.\nAs it turns out,\nthere's a strong form and a weak form of this knot,\nand we were taught to tie the weak form.\nAnd here's how to tell.\nIf you pull the strands at the base of the knot,\nyou will see that the bow will orient itself\ndown the long axis of the shoe.\nThat's the weak form of the knot."
p1727
aS'\nBut not to worry.\nIf we start over\nand simply go the other direction\naround the bow,\nwe get this, the strong form of the knot.\nAnd if you pull the cords under the knot,\nyou will see that the bow orients itself\nalong the transverse axis of the shoe.\nThis is a stronger knot. It will come untied less often.\nIt will let you down less,\nand not only that, it looks better.'
p1728
aS"\nWe're going to do this one more time.\n(Applause)\nStart as usual,\ngo the other way around the loop.\nThis is a little hard for children,\nbut I think you can handle it.\nPull the knot.\nThere it is: the strong form of the shoe knot."

aa(lp1733
S"\nWe live in an incredibly busy world.\nThe pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy,\nand we're always doing something."
p1734
aS"\nSo with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment\nto think, when did you last take any time to do nothing?\nJust 10 minutes, undisturbed?\nAnd when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.\nSo that's no emailing, texting, no Internet,\nno TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading,\nnot even sitting there reminiscing about the past\nor planning for the future.\nSimply doing nothing.\nI see a lot of very blank faces. (Laughter)\nMy thinking is, you probably have to go a long way back."
p1735
aS"\nAnd this is an extraordinary thing, right?\nWe're talking about our mind.\nThe mind, our most valuable and precious resource,\nthrough which we experience every single moment of our life,\nthe mind that we rely upon\nto be happy, content, emotionally stable as individuals,\nand at the same time to be kind and thoughtful\nand considerate in our relationships with others.\nThis is the same mind that we depend upon\nto be focused, creative, spontaneous,\nand to perform at our very best in everything that we do.\nAnd yet, we don't take any time out to look after it.\nIn fact, we spend more time looking after our cars,\nour clothes and our hair than we\n okay, maybe not our hair, but you see where I'm going."
p1736
aS"\nThe result, of course, is that we get stressed.\nYou know, the mind whizzes away like a washing machine\ngoing round and round, lots of difficult, confusing emotions,\nand we don't really know how to deal with that,\nand the sad fact is that we are so distracted\nthat we're no longer present in the world in which we live.\nWe miss out on the things that are most important to us,\nand the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes,\nwell, that's the way life is, so we've just kind of got to get on with it.\nThat's really not how it has to be."
p1737
aS"\nSo I was about 11 when I went along\nto my first meditation class.\nAnd trust me, it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine,\nthe sitting cross-legged on the floor,\nthe incense, the herbal tea, the vegetarians, the whole deal,\nbut my mom was going and I was intrigued, so I went along with her.\nI'd also seen a few kung fu movies, and secretly\nI kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly,\nbut I was very young at the time.\nNow as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people,\nI assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.\nYou get stressed, you do some meditation.\nI hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature,\nuntil I was about 20, when a number of things happened\nin my life in quite quick succession,\nreally serious things which just flipped my life upside down\nand all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts,\ninundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with.\nEvery time I sort of pushed one down,\nanother one would just sort of pop back up again.\nIt was a really very stressful time."
p1738
aS'\nI guess we all deal with stress in different ways.\nSome people will bury themselves in work,\ngrateful for the distraction.\nOthers will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support.\nSome people hit the bottle, start taking medication.\nMy own way of dealing with it was to become a monk.\nSo I quit my degree, I headed off to the Himalayas,\nI became a monk, and I started studying meditation.'
p1739
aS"\nPeople often ask me what I learned from that time.\nWell, obviously it changed things.\nLet's face it, becoming a celibate monk\nis going to change a number of things.\nBut it was more than that.\nIt taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation,\nan understanding for the present moment.\nBy that I mean not being lost in thought,\nnot being distracted,\nnot being overwhelmed by difficult emotions,\nbut instead learning how to be in the here and now,\nhow to be mindful, how to be present."
p1740
aS"\nI think the present moment is so underrated.\nIt sounds so ordinary, and yet we spend so little time\nin the present moment that it's anything but ordinary.\nThere was a research paper that came out of Harvard,\njust recently, that said on average our minds\nare lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time.\nForty-seven percent.\nAt the same time, this sort of constant mind-wandering\nis also a direct cause of unhappiness.\nNow we're not here for that long anyway,\nbut to spend almost half of our life lost in thought\nand potentially quite unhappy,\ndunno, it just kind of seems tragic, actually,\nespecially when there's something we can do about it,\nwhen there's a positive, practical, achievable,\nscientifically proven technique\nwhich allows our mind to be more healthy,\nto be more mindful and less distracted.\nAnd the beauty of it is that even though\nit need only take about 10 minutes a day,\nit impacts our entire life.\nBut we need to know how to do it.\nWe need an exercise. We need a framework\nto learn how to be more mindful.\nThat's essentially what meditation is.\nIt's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment.\nBut we also need to know how to approach it\nin the right way to get the best from it.\nAnd that's what these are for, in case you've been wondering,\nbecause most people assume\nthat meditation is all about stopping thoughts,\ngetting rid of emotions, somehow controlling the mind,\nbut actually it's quite different from that.\nIt's more about stepping back,\nseeing the thought clearly,\nwitnessing it coming and going, emotions coming and going\nwithout judgment, but with a relaxed, focused mind."
p1741
aS"\nSo for example, right now,\nif I focus too much on the balls, then there's no way\nthat I can relax and talk to you at the same time.\nEqually, if I relax too much talking to you,\nthen there's no way I can focus on the balls. I'm going to drop them.\nNow in life, and in meditation, there'll be times\nwhen the focus becomes a little bit too intense,\nand life starts to feel a bit like this.\nIt's a very uncomfortable way to live life,\nwhen you get this tight and stressed.\nAt other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much,\nand things just become a sort of little bit like this.\nOf course in meditation  (Snores) \nwe're going to end up falling asleep.\nSo we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation\nwhere we can allow thoughts to come and go\nwithout all the usual involvement."
p1742
aS'\nNow, what usually happens when we\'re learning to be mindful\nis that we get distracted by a thought.\nLet\'s say this is an anxious thought.\nSo everything\'s going fine, and then we see the anxious thought,\nand it\'s like, "Oh, didn\'t realize I was worried about that."\nYou go back to it, repeat it. "Oh, I am worried.\nOh, I really am worried. Wow, there\'s so much anxiety."\nAnd before we know it, right,\nwe\'re anxious about feeling anxious.\nYou know, this is crazy. We do this all the time,\neven on an everyday level.\nIf you think about the last time, I dunno,\nyou had a wobbly tooth.\nYou know it\'s wobbly, and you know that it hurts.\nBut what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?\n(Mumbling) It does hurt. And we reinforce the storyline, right?\nAnd we just keep telling ourselves,\nand we do it all the time. And it\'s only in learning\nto watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go\nof those storylines and patterns of mind.\nBut when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way,\nyou might see many different patterns.\nYou might find a mind that\'s really restless and --\nthe whole time.\nDon\'t be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body\nwhen you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that.\nYou might find a mind that\'s very dull\nand boring, and it\'s just, almost mechanical,\nit just seems it\'s as if you\'re\ngetting up, going to work, eat, sleep, get up, work.\nOr it might just be that one little nagging thought\nthat just goes round and round and round your mind.\nWell, whatever it is, meditation offers\nthe opportunity, the potential to step back\nand to get a different perspective,\nto see that things aren\'t always as they appear.\nWe can\'t change\nevery little thing that happens to us in life,\nbut we can change the way that we experience it.\nThat\'s the potential of meditation, of mindfulness.\nYou don\'t have to burn any incense,\nand you definitely don\'t have to sit on the floor.\nAll you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day\nto step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment\nso that you get to experience a greater sense\nof focus, calm and clarity in your life.'

aS'\nI\'m obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.\nFour years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day\nfrom people I don\'t know, and it\'s been an amazing opportunity\nto kind of get to know different cultures, you know?\nIt\'s like a microscope to the rest of the world.\nYou can kind of peer into other people\'s lives,\nand I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration\nfrom the average user.\nFor example, somebody wrote me.\nThey said, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,\nyou should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"\nAnd they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,\nbut I meant the kind of rocking out where we\'d be naked."'

So I decided to try my hand.\nI came up with a few games.'

p1873
aS'\nAnd Chris had said in an email that, you know,\nwe should really bring something new to TED,\nsomething that we haven\'t shown anyone.\nSo, I made this for TED. It\'s "Christian."\nIt\'s the third in the series.\nI\'m hoping it\'s going to do well this year.'

p1877

p1880
aS'\na random number between one and 500 million.'
p1881
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1882
aS'\nSo really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.'
p1883
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1884
aS"\nTech joy, to me, means something,\nbecause I get a lot of joy out of tech.\nAnd in fact, making things using technology --\nand I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice --\nI won't -- hold on. Making things, you know --\nmaking things actually does give me a lot of joy.\nIt's the process of creation that keeps me sort of\na bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,\nand it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project --\nwhere you know you still have something to do,\nbut it's not finished, and you're not starting something --\nthat really fills my entire life."
p1885
aS"\nAnd so, what I've done is, I started getting interested\nin creating online social spaces to share that feeling\nwith people who don't consider themselves artists.\nWe're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software\nbecause, you know, it's unapproachable,\npeople feel like they have to read the manual.\nSo I try to --\n(Laughter)\n-- I try to create these very minimal activities\nthat allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully --\nwhoa, I'm like -- on the page, but it doesn't exist.\n(Laughter)\nIt's, like -- seriously, though --"
p1886
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1887
aS'\nI try to create meaningful environments\nfor people to express themselves.'
p1888
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1889
aS'\nHere I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"\nwhich, I think, really resonated with the --'
p1890
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1891
aS'\nworking population.'
p1892
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1893
aS'\nOver 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.'
p1894
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1895
aS'\nAgain, people from all over the country doing --\nthe watch is particularly incredible.'
p1896
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1897
aS"\nOnline drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.\nI think they're wonderful.\nI think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons\nand all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process,\nthe process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.\nAnd the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,\nand they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,\nawful little thing that they created.\nAnd eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,\nor draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that."
p1898
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1899
aS"\nSo, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.\nIn other words, it's a helping tool.\nYou can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates\nwith you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching."
p1900
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1901
aS"\nSo you can -- in fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things\nthat look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling, and --\nso the idea is that you can really,\nyou know, partake in this process,\nbut watch something really crappy look beautiful.\nAnd here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette\nthat was submitted to me. Here we are, very cool."
p1902
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1903
aS"\nDarling. Beautiful stuff.\nI mean this is incredible. This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this\nand submitted it. It's just gorgeous."
p1904
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1905
aS"\nI'm -- I'm dead serious here. I'm actually -- this is not a joke."
p1906
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p1907
aS'\nBut, I think, it\'s a -- it\'s a really fun and wonderful thing.\nSo this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space,\nwhich is -- it\'s basically a refurbished message board\nthat encourages collaborative fiction writing.\nThese are haikus.\nNone of the haikus were written by the same person,\nand in fact, no line was --\nyou know, each line is contributed by a different person\nat a different -- at a different time.\nI think that the "now tied up, tied down,\nmistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it\'s up."\nIt\'s -- it\'s an amazing way, and I\'ll tell you,\nif you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,\nsays, "Let\'s talk" -- that, like, chills you to the very core.'
p1908
aS"\nBut it's peripheral activities, like these,\nthat allow people to get together, doing fun things.\nThey actually get to know each other,\nand it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key\nto bringing up some of our bonding social capital\nthat we're lacking. And very, very quickly --\nI love puppets. Here's a puppet.\nIt dances to music. Lotte Reiniger,\nan amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s,\nthat started doing more elaborate things.\nI became interested in puppets,\nand I just want to show one last thing to you.\nOh, this is how you make puppets."

p1911
aS'\n(Applause)'
p1912
aa(lp1913
S"\nWhat I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can,\nis some foundational work, some new technology\nthat we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition\nalmost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon,\nand it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely\ninteract with vast amounts of visual data."
p1914
aS"\nWe're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here\nand kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in,\npanning through the thing, rearranging it in any way we want.\nAnd it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at,\nhow big these collections are or how big the images are.\nMost of them are ordinary digital camera photos,\nbut this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress,\nand it's in the 300 megapixel range.\nIt doesn't make any difference\nbecause the only thing that ought to limit the performance\nof a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen"
p1915
aS'\nat any given moment. It\'s also very flexible architecture.\nThis is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.\nThis is "Bleak House" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter.\nTo prove to you that it\'s really text, and not an image,\nwe can do something like so, to really show\nthat this is a real representation of the text; it\'s not a picture.\nMaybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book.\nI wouldn\'t recommend it.'
p1916
aS"\nThis is a more realistic case. This is an issue of The Guardian.\nEvery large image is the beginning of a section.\nAnd this really gives you the joy and the good experience\nof reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper,\nwhich is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.\nWe've also done a little something\nwith the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.\nWe've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution --\nmuch higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad --\nand we've embedded extra content.\nIf you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.\nOr other models, or even technical specifications.\nAnd this really gets at some of these ideas\nabout really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.\nWe hope that this means no more pop-ups\nand other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary."
p1917
aS"\nOf course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications\nfor a technology like this.\nAnd this one I really won't spend any time on,\nexcept to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.\nBut those are all the roads in the U.S.\nsuperimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image.\nSo let's pull up, now, something else.\nThis is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out."
p1918
aS"\nThis is a project called Photosynth,\nwhich really marries two different technologies.\nOne of them is Seadragon\nand the other is some very beautiful computer vision research\ndone by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington,\nco-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.\nand Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration.\nAnd so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon.\nYou can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views,\nwhere we can dive through images\nand have this kind of multi-resolution experience."
p1919
aS"\nBut the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful.\nThe computer vision algorithms have registered these images together\nso that they correspond to the real space in which these shots --\nall taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies --\nall these shots were taken. So you see elements here\nof stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging,\nand these things have all been related spatially.\nI'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.\nThere are some that are much more spatial.\nI would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets --\nand this is from an early prototype of Photosynth\nthat we first got working in the summer --\nto show you what I think\nis really the punch line behind this technology,\nthe Photosynth technology. And it's not necessarily so apparent\nfrom looking at the environments that we've put up on the website.\nWe had to worry about the lawyers and so on."
p1920
aS"\nThis is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral\nthat was done entirely computationally\nfrom images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr,\nand you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts, and of the campus\nand so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image\nthat was discovered to belong to this model.\nAnd so these are all Flickr images,\nand they've all been related spatially in this way.\nAnd we can just navigate in this very simple way.\n(Applause)"
p1921
aS"\nYou know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.\nIt's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.\n(Laughter)"
p1922
aS"\nI guess you can see\nthis is lots of different types of cameras:\nit's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs,\nquite a large number of them, stitched\ntogether in this environment.\nAnd if I can, I'll find some of the sort of weird ones.\nSo many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.\nSomewhere in here there are actually\na series of photographs -- here we go.\nThis is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly.\nWe can dive in from the poster\nto a physical view of this environment."
p1923
aS"\nWhat the point here really is is that we can do things\nwith the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody --\nfrom the entire collective memory\nof, visually, of what the Earth looks like --\nand link all of that together.\nAll of those photos become linked together,\nand they make something emergent\nthat's greater than the sum of the parts.\nYou have a model that emerges of the entire Earth.\nThink of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.\nAnd this is something that grows in complexity\nas people use it, and whose benefits become greater\nto the users as they use it.\nTheir own photos are getting tagged with meta-data\nthat somebody else entered.\nIf somebody bothered to tag all of these saints\nand say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral\nsuddenly gets enriched with all of that data,\nand I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space,\ninto that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos,\nand do a kind of a cross-modal\nand cross-user social experience that way.\nAnd of course, a by-product of all of that\nis immensely rich virtual models\nof every interesting part of the Earth, collected\nnot just from overhead flights and from satellite images\nand so on, but from the collective memory."
p1924
aS'\nThank you so much.\n(Applause)'
p1925
aS'\nChris Anderson: Do I understand this right? That what your software is going to allow,\nis that at some point, really within the next few years,\nall the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world\nare going to basically link together?'
p1926
aS"\nBAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering.\nIt's creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images.\nAnd it's doing that\nbased on the content inside the images.\nAnd that gets really exciting when you think about the richness\nof the semantic information that a lot of those images have.\nLike when you do a web search for images,\nyou type in phrases, and the text on the web page\nis carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of.\nNow, what if that picture links to all of your pictures?\nThen the amount of semantic interconnection\nand the amount of richness that comes out of that\nis really huge. It's a classic network effect."
p1927
aS'\nCA: Blaise, that is truly incredible. Congratulations.'
p1928
aS'\nBAA: Thanks so much.'
p1929
aa(lp1930
S"\nI'm really, really excited to be here today,\nbecause I'm about to show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab,\nliterally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be amongst the first to be able to\nsee it in person, because I really, really think this is going to change\n-- really change -- the way we interact with machines from this point on."
p1931
aS"\nNow, this is a rear-projected drafting table. It's about 36 inches wide\nand it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor. Now, normal touch sensors that\nyou see, like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards,\ncan only register one point of contact at a time.\nThis thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.\nThey can use both my hands; I can use chording actions;\nI can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to.\nYou know, like that."
p1932
aS"\nNow, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new.\nI mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.\nHowever, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution,\nlow-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.\nSo, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now,\nother than probably its newfound accessibility.\nWhat's really interesting here is what you can do with it\nand the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see."
p1933
aS"\nSo, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here. Now, you can see,\nI can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze together and put the blobs\ntogether. I can inject heat into the system here,\nor I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.\nIt's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual.\nThe interface just kind of disappears.\nThis started out as kind of a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in\nour lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. But I think its true identity comes out here."
p1934
aS"\nNow what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know,\nI could be doing this with as many fingers here,\nbut of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.\nSo Chris could be out here interacting with another part of Lava,\nwhile I kind of play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool,\nwhere I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable,\nand then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state.\nGoogle should have something like this in their lobby. (Laughter)"
p1935
aS"\nI'll show you something -- a little more of a concrete example here, as this thing loads.\nThis is a photographer's light box application.\nAgain, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.\nBut what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers,\nI can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.\nI can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.\nI can do that grossly with both of my hands,\nor I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together.\nIf I grab the canvas, I can kind of do the same thing -- stretch it out.\nI can do it simultaneously, where I'm holding this down,\nand gripping on another one, stretching this out like this."

aS"\nAgain, the interface just disappears here.\nThere's no manual. This is exactly what you expect,\nespecially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.\nNow, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop,\nI kind of cringe at the idea that we're going to introduce a whole new generation\nof people to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface.\nThis is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines\nfrom this point on. (Applause)\nNow, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.\nAnd I can bring that around, put that up there.\nNow, obviously, this is kind of a standard keyboard,\nbut of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.\nAnd that's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age that\nwe should be conforming to a physical device.\nThat leads to bad things, like RSI.\nWe have so much technology nowadays that these\ninterfaces should start conforming to us.\nThere's so little applied now to actually improving the\nway we interact with interfaces from this point on.\nThis keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go.\nYou can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology,\na keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away,\nand really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke with your hands.\nSo -- again, isn't this great?"
p1937
aS"\nAudience: Where's your lab?"
p1938
aS"\nJeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York."
p1939
aS"\nHere's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls.\nIt'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands.\nIt's pressure-sensitive, you can notice.\nBut what's neat about that is, again, I showed you that two-finger gesture that allows you to\nzoom in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool\nor the magnifying glass tool,\nyou can just continuously make things in real multiple scales, all at the same time.\nI can create big things out here, but I can go back and really quickly go back\nto where I started, and make even smaller things here."
p1940
aS"\nNow this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like\ndata visualization. For instance, I think we all really enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,\nand he really emphasized the fact that I've been thinking about for a long time too:\nwe have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there.\nWe're not really accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is, is because\n-- we'll be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools,\nbut I also think a big part of it is going to be starting to be able to have better interfaces,\nto be able to drill down into this kind of data, while still thinking about the big picture here."
p1941
aS"\nLet me show you another app here. This is something called WorldWind.\nIt's done by NASA. It's a kind of -- we've all seen Google Earth;\nthis is an open-source version of that. There are plug-ins to be able to\nload in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years.\nBut as you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures\nto go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again.\nIt really allows anybody to kind of go in -- and, it just does what you'd expect,\nyou know? Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears.\nI can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here.\nThere you go. NASA's really cool. They have these hyper-spectral images\nthat are false-colored so you can -- it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well, let's go back to this."
p1942
aS"\nNow, the great thing about mapping applications --\nit's not really 2D, it's kind of 3D. So, again, with a multi-point interface,\nyou can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that,\nyou know. It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.\nNow, this gesture that we've developed, again, is just putting two fingers down --\nit's defining an axis of tilt -- and I can tilt up and down that way.\nThat's something we just came up with on the spot,\nyou know; it's probably not the right thing to do,\nbut there's such interesting things you can do with this kind of interface.\nIt's just so much fun playing around with too. (Laughter)"
p1943
aS"\nAnd so the last thing I want to show you is --\nyou know, I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps\nthat you can do with this thing.\nI'm a little more interested in the kind of creative applications we can do with this.\nNow, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve.\nAnd when I close it, it becomes a character.\nBut the neat thing about it is I can add control points.\nAnd then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.\nAnd you notice what it does.\nIt's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use\nas many fingers as I have to draw and make --"
p1944
aS"\nNow, there's a lot of actual math going on under here\nfor this to control this mesh and do the right thing.\nI mean, this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here,\nwith multiple control points, is actually something that's state of the art.\nIt was just released at Siggraph last year,\nbut it's a great example of the kind of research I really love:\nall this compute power to apply to make things do the right things,\nintuitive things, to do exactly what you expect."
p1945
aS"\nSo, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI.\nI'm not the only one doing it; there are a lot of other people getting into it.\nThis kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it,\nand I'm really looking forward to interacting with all you guys\nover the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.\nThank you.\n(Applause)"
p1946
aa(lp1947
S"\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, at TED\nwe talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement.\nSo let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes\nand dissect some lessons from it."
p1948
aS"\nFirst, of course you know, a leader needs the guts\nto stand out and be ridiculed.\nBut what he's doing is so easy to follow.\nSo here's his first follower with a crucial role;\nhe's going to show everyone else how to follow."
p1949
aS"\nNow, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.\nSo, now it's not about the leader anymore;\nit's about them, plural.\nNow, there he is calling to his friends.\nNow, if you notice that the first follower"
p1950
aS'\nis actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.\nIt takes guts to stand out like that.\nThe first follower is what transforms\na lone nut into a leader.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)'
p1951
aS"\nAnd here comes a second follower.\nNow it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts --\nthree is a crowd, and a crowd is news.\nSo a movement must be public.\nIt's important to show not just to show the leader, but the followers,\nbecause you find that new followers\nemulate the followers, not the leader."
p1952
aS"\nNow, here come two more people, and immediately after,\nthree more people.\nNow we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.\nNow we've got a movement.\nSo, notice that, as more people join in,\nit's less risky.\nSo those that were sitting on the fence before, now have no reason not to.\nThey won't stand out,\nthey won't be ridiculed,\nbut they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.\n(Laughter)\nSo, over the next minute,\nyou'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd\nbecause eventually they would be ridiculed\nfor not joining in.\nAnd that's how you make a movement."
p1953
aS"\nBut let's recap some lessons from this.\nSo first, if you are the type,\nlike the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,\nremember the importance of nurturing\nyour first few followers as equals\nso it's clearly about the movement, not you.\nOkay, but we might have missed the real lesson here."
p1954
aS"\nThe biggest lesson, if you noticed --\ndid you catch it? -- is that leadership\nis over-glorified.\nThat, yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first,\nand he'll get all the credit,\nbut it was really the first follower\nthat transformed the lone nut into a leader.\nSo, as we're told that we should all be leaders,\nthat would be really ineffective."
p1955
aS'\nIf you really care about starting a movement,\nhave the courage to follow\nand show others how to follow.\nAnd when you find a lone nut doing something great,\nhave the guts to be the first one\nto stand up and join in.\nAnd what a perfect place to do that, at TED.'
p1956
aS'\nThanks.\n(Applause)'
p1957
aa(lp1958
S'\nPhilosophers, dramatists, theologians\nhave grappled with this question for centuries:\nwhat makes people go wrong?\nInterestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid.\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto\nin New York, I was surrounded by evil,\nas all kids are who grew up in an inner city.\nAnd I had friends who were really good kids,\nwho lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.\nThat is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail.\nSome got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.'
p1959
aS"\nSo when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.\nThe only question is, what was in the juice?\nAnd more importantly, that line between good and evil --\nwhich privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable,\nwith them on the good side, and the others on the bad side --\nI knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.\nGood people could be seduced across that line,\nand under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover\nwith help, with reform, with rehabilitation."
p1960
aS"\nSo I want to begin with this this wonderful illusion\nby [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.\nIf you look at it and focus on the white,\nwhat you see is a world full of angels.\nBut let's look more deeply, and as we do,\nwhat appears is the demons, the devils in the world.\nAnd that tells us several things."
p1961
aS'\nOne, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil,\nbecause good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.\nIt tells me something else. If you remember,\nGod\'s favorite angel was Lucifer.\nApparently, Lucifer means "the light."\nIt also means "the morning star," in some scripture.\nAnd apparently, he disobeyed God,\nand that\'s the ultimate disobedience to authority.\nAnd when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent\nto kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels.\nAnd so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan,\nbecomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.'
p1962
aS"\nParadoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.\nHe didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.\nSo, this arc of the cosmic transformation\nof God's favorite angel into the Devil,\nfor me, sets the context for understanding human beings\nwho are transformed from good, ordinary people\ninto perpetrators of evil."
p1963
aS'\nSo the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives --\nthe negatives that people can become,\nnot the negatives that people are --\nleads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power.\nAnd that\'s the key: it\'s about power.\nTo intentionally harm people psychologically,\nto hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas,\nand to commit crimes against humanity.\nIf you Google "evil," a word that should surely have withered by now,\nyou come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.'
p1964
aS"\nA few years ago -- I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was,\nwith the revelation of American soldiers\nabusing prisoners in a strange place\nin a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq.\nAnd these were men and women\nwho were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.\nI was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,\nbecause I had seen those same visual parallels\nwhen I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study."
p1965
aS'\nImmediately the Bush administration military said ... what?\nWhat all administrations say when there\'s a scandal.\n"Don\'t blame us. It\'s not the system. It\'s the few bad apples,\nthe few rogue soldiers."\nMy hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually.\nMaybe it was the barrel that was bad.\nBut how am I going to -- how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?'
p1966
aS'\nI became an expert witness\nfor one of the guards, Sergeant Chip Frederick,\nand in that position, I had access to the dozen investigative reports.\nI had access to him. I could study him,\nhave him come to my home, get to know him,\ndo psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.\nAnd thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures\nthat these soldiers took.\nThese pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.\nAll of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.\nBecause everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera,\nthey took pictures of everything. More than 1,000.'
p1967
aS"\nAnd what I've done is I organized them into various categories.\nBut these are by United States military police, army reservists.\nThey are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.\nAnd it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift.\nWhy? Tier 1-A was the center for military intelligence.\nIt was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there.\nInterrogators from Titan Corporation, all there,\nand they're getting no information about the insurgency.\nSo they're going to put pressure on these soldiers,\nmilitary police, to cross the line,\ngive them permission to break the will of the enemy,\nto prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up,\nto take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms,\nand this is how it was interpreted.\nLet's go down to that dungeon."
p1968
aS'\n(Camera shutter)\n(Thuds)\n(Camera shutter)\n(Thuds)\n(Breathing)\n(Bells)'
p1969
aS'\nSo, pretty horrific.\nThat\'s one of the visual illustrations of evil.\nAnd it should not have escaped you that\nthe reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out\nwith Leonardo da Vinci\'s ode to humanity\nis that that prisoner was mentally ill.\nThat prisoner covered himself with shit every day,\nand they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn\'t stink.\nBut the guards ended up calling him "Shit Boy."\nWhat was he doing in that prison\nrather than in some mental institution?'
p1970
aS'\nIn any event, here\'s former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.\nHe comes down and says, "I want to know, who is responsible?\nWho are the bad apples?" Well, that\'s a bad question.\nYou have to reframe it and ask, "What is responsible?"\nBecause "what" could be the who of people,\nbut it could also be the what of the situation,\nand obviously that\'s wrongheaded.'
p1971
aS"\nSo how do psychologists go about understanding\nsuch transformations of human character,\nif you believe that they were good soldiers\nbefore they went down to that dungeon?\nThere are three ways. The main way is -- it's called dispositional.\nWe look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples."
p1972
aS'\nThis is the foundation of all of social science,\nthe foundation of religion, the foundation of war.\nSocial psychologists like me come along and say, "Yeah,\npeople are the actors on the stage,\nbut you\'ll have to be aware of what that situation is.\nWho are the cast of characters? What\'s the costume?\nIs there a stage director?"\nAnd so we\'re interested in, what are the external factors\naround the individual -- the bad barrel?\nAnd social scientists stop there, and they miss the big point\nthat I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.\nThe power is in the system.\nThe system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals,\nand the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background.\nAnd this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.'
p1973
aS"\nSo if you want to change a person, you've got to change the situation.\nIf you want to change the situation,\nyou've got to know where the power is, in the system.\nSo the Lucifer effect involves understanding\nhuman character transformations with these three factors.\nAnd it's a dynamic interplay.\nWhat do the people bring into the situation?\nWhat does the situation bring out of them?\nAnd what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?"
p1974
aS'\nSo my book, "The Lucifer Effect," recently published, is about,\nhow do you understand how good people turn evil?\nAnd it has a lot of detail\nabout what I\'m going to talk about today.\nSo Dr. Z\'s "Lucifer Effect," although it focuses on evil,\nreally is a celebration of the human mind\'s\ninfinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel,\ncaring or indifferent, creative or destructive,\nand it makes some of us villains.\nAnd the good news story that I\'m going to hopefully come to\nat the end is that it makes some of us heroes.\nThis is a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker,\nwhich really summarizes my whole talk:\n"I\'m neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.\nLike yourself, I\'m a complex amalgam\nof positive and negative personality traits\nthat emerge or not, depending on the circumstances."\n(Laughter)'
p1975
aS'\nThere\'s a study some of you think you know about,\nbut very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie.\nThis is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx,\nand he asked the question, "Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"\nPeople say, "No, that\'s Nazi Germany,\nthat\'s Hitler, you know, that\'s 1939."\nHe said, "Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you,\n\'Would you electrocute a stranger?\' \'No way, not me, I\'m a good person.\' "\nHe said, "Why don\'t we put you in a situation\nand give you a chance to see what you would do?"'
p1976
aS'\nAnd so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people.\n500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport.\nAnd the ad said, "Psychologists want to understand memory.\nWe want to improve people\'s memory,\nbecause memory is the key to success." OK?\n"We\'re going to give you five bucks -- four dollars for your time."\nAnd it said, "We don\'t want college students.\nWe want men between 20 and 50."\nIn the later studies, they ran women.\nOrdinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.'
p1977
aS'\nSo, you go down, and one of you is going to be a learner,\nand one of you is going to be a teacher.\nThe learner\'s a genial, middle-aged guy.\nHe gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room.\nThe learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20.\nAnd one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat,\n"Your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn.\nGets it right, reward him.\nGets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box.\nThe first button is 15 volts. He doesn\'t even feel it."\nThat\'s the key. All evil starts with 15 volts.\nAnd then the next step is another 15 volts.\nThe problem is, at the end of the line, it\'s 450 volts.\nAnd as you go along, the guy is screaming,\n"I\'ve got a heart condition! I\'m out of here!"'
p1978
aS'\nYou\'re a good person. You complain.\n"Sir, who\'s going to be responsible if something happens to him?"\nThe experimenter says, "Don\'t worry, I will be responsible.\nContinue, teacher."\nAnd the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?\nYou should notice here, when it gets up to 375,\nit says, "Danger. Severe Shock."\nWhen it gets up to here, there\'s "XXX" -- the pornography of power.\n(Laughter)'
p1979
aS'\nSo Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,\n"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?"\nThey said only one percent. Because that\'s sadistic behavior,\nand we know, psychiatry knows, only one percent of Americans are sadistic.\nOK. Here\'s the data. They could not be more wrong.\nTwo thirds go all the way to 450 volts. This was just one study.\nMilgram did more than 16 studies. And look at this.\nIn study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way,\n90 percent go all the way. In study five, if you see people rebel, 90 percent rebel.\nWhat about women? Study 13 -- no different than men.\nSo Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people\nto blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts.\nAnd it\'s like a dial on human nature.\nA dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient,\ndown to the majority, down to none.'
p1980
aS"\nSo what are the external parallels? For all research is artificial.\nWhat's the validity in the real world?\n912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered\nby family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978,\nbecause they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor --\nnot their priest -- their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones.\nHe persuaded them to commit mass suicide.\nAnd so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,\na man of God who becomes the Angel of Death.\nMilgram's study is all about individual authority to control people.\nMost of the time, we are in institutions,\nso the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions\nto influence individual behavior.\nInterestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class\nin James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954."
p1981
aS"\nSo this study, which I did\nwith my graduate students, especially Craig Haney --\nwe also began work with an ad.\nWe didn't have money, so we had a cheap, little ad,\nbut we wanted college students for a study of prison life.\n75 people volunteered, took personality tests.\nWe did interviews. Picked two dozen:\nthe most normal, the most healthy.\nRandomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard.\nSo on day one, we knew we had good apples.\nI'm going to put them in a bad situation."
p1982
aS'\nAnd secondly, we know there\'s no difference\nbetween the boys who are going to be guards\nand the boys who are going to be prisoners.\nThe kids who were going to be prisoners,\nwe said, "Wait at home in the dormitories. The study will begin Sunday."\nWe didn\'t tell them\nthat the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.\n(Video) Student: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door,\nand knocks, and says he\'s looking for me.\nSo they, right there, you know, they took me out the door,\nthey put my hands against the car.\nIt was a real cop car, it was a real policeman,\nand there were real neighbors in the street,\nwho didn\'t know that this was an experiment.\nAnd there was cameras all around and neighbors all around.\nThey put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto.\nThey took me to the police station,\nthe basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell.\nI was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell,\nwhich was just like a room with a door with bars on it.\nYou could tell it wasn\'t a real jail.\nThey locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit.\nThey were taking this experiment too seriously.'
p1983
aS"\nPhilip Zimbardo: Here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized.\nThey're going to become numbers.\nHere are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.\nGuards get prisoners\nto clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands,\nto do other humiliating tasks.\nThey strip them naked. They sexually taunt them.\nThey begin to do degrading activities,\nlike having them simulate sodomy.\nYou saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.\nMy guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme\nthat normal kids we picked because they were healthy\nhad breakdowns within 36 hours.\nThe study ended after six days, because it was out of control.\nFive kids had emotional breakdowns."
p1984
aS'\nDoes it make a difference if warriors go to battle\nchanging their appearance or not?\nDoes it make a difference if they\'re anonymous,\nin how they treat their victims?\nWe know in some cultures, they go to war,\nthey don\'t change their appearance.\nIn other cultures, they paint themselves like "Lord of the Flies."\nIn some, they wear masks.\nIn many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform.\nSo this anthropologist, John Watson, found\n23 cultures that had two bits of data.\nDo they change their appearance? 15.\nDo they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.\nIf they don\'t change their appearance,\nonly one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates.\nThe key is in the red zone.\nIf they change their appearance,\n12 of 13 -- that\'s 90 percent -- kill, torture, mutilate.\nAnd that\'s the power of anonymity.'
p1985
aS'\nSo what are the seven social processes\nthat grease the slippery slope of evil?\nMindlessly taking the first small step.\nDehumanization of others. De-individuation of Self.\nDiffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority.\nUncritical conformity to group norms.\nPassive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference.'
p1986
aS'\nAnd it happens when you\'re in a new or unfamiliar situation.\nYour habitual response patterns don\'t work.\nYour personality and morality are disengaged.\n"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer;\nnothing more difficult than understanding him," Dostoyevksy tells us.\nUnderstanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-iology.'
p1987
aS'\nSo social and psychological research reveals\nhow ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs.\nYou don\'t need it. You just need the social-psychological processes.\nReal world parallels? Compare this with this.\nJames Schlesinger -- and I\'m going to have to end with this -- says,\n"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why\nindividuals and groups who usually act humanely\ncan sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances."\nThat\'s the Lucifer effect.\nAnd he goes on to say, "The landmark Stanford study\nprovides a cautionary tale for all military operations."\nIf you give people power without oversight,\nit\'s a prescription for abuse. They knew that, and let that happen.'
p1988
aS'\nSo another report, an investigative report by General Fay,\nsays the system is guilty. And in this report,\nhe says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib,\nby leadership failures that contributed\nto the occurrence of such abuse,\nand the fact that it remained undiscovered\nby higher authorities for a long period of time.\nThose abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store?\nThe answer is nobody, and, I think, nobody on purpose.\nHe gave the guards permission to do those things,\nand they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.'
p1989
aS'\nSo you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas.\nThe shift is away from the medical model\nthat focuses only on the individual.\nThe shift is toward a public health model\nthat recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.\nBullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease.\nAnd since the Inquisition, we\'ve been dealing with problems\nat the individual level. And you know what? It doesn\'t work.\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, "The line between good and evil\ncuts through the heart of every human being."\nThat means that line is not out there.\nThat\'s a decision that you have to make. That\'s a personal thing.'
p1990
aS"\nSo I want to end very quickly on a positive note.\nHeroism as the antidote to evil,\nby promoting the heroic imagination,\nespecially in our kids, in our educational system.\nWe want kids to think, I'm the hero in waiting,\nwaiting for the right situation to come along,\nand I will act heroically.\nMy whole life is now going to focus away from evil --\nthat I've been in since I was a kid -- to understanding heroes."
p1991
aS'\nBanality of heroism\nis, it\'s ordinary people who do heroic deeds.\nIt\'s the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt\'s "Banality of Evil."\nOur traditional societal heroes are wrong,\nbecause they are the exceptions.\nThey organize their whole life around this.\nThat\'s why we know their names.\nAnd our kids\' heroes are also wrong models for them,\nbecause they have supernatural talents.\nWe want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people,\nand the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby.\nHe was the one that stopped those abuses you saw,\nbecause when he saw those images,\nhe turned them over to a senior investigating officer.\nHe was a low-level private, and that stopped it. Was he a hero? No.\nThey had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him,\nand then his mother and his wife.\nFor three years, they were in hiding.'
p1992
aS'\nThis is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study.\nWhen I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent.\nI didn\'t know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent.\nShe came down, saw that madhouse and said,\n"You know what, it\'s terrible what you\'re doing to those boys.\nThey\'re not prisoners, they\'re not guards,\nthey\'re boys, and you are responsible."\nAnd I ended the study the next day.\nThe good news is I married her the next year.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nI just came to my senses, obviously.'
p1993
aS'\nSo situations have the power to do, through --\nbut the point is, this is the same situation\nthat can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us,\nthat makes us perpetrators of evil,\ncan inspire the heroic imagination in others. It\'s the same situation.\nAnd you\'re on one side or the other.\nMost people are guilty of the evil of inaction,\nbecause your mother said, "Don\'t get involved. Mind your own business."\nAnd you have to say, "Mama, humanity is my business."'
p1994
aS'\nSo the psychology of heroism is -- we\'re going to end in a moment --\nhow do we encourage children in new hero courses,\nthat I\'m working with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop --\nto develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling,\n"I am a hero in waiting," and teach them skills.\nTo be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant,\nbecause you\'re always going against the conformity of the group.\nHeroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.'

aS'\nThe key to heroism is two things.\nA: you\'ve got to act when other people are passive.\nB: you have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically.\nAnd I want to end with the story that some of you know,\nabout Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.\nFifty-year-old African-American construction worker.\nHe\'s standing on a subway in New York.\nA white guy falls on the tracks.\nThe subway train is coming. There\'s 75 people there.\nYou know what? They freeze.\nHe\'s got a reason not to get involved.\nHe\'s black, the guy\'s white, and he\'s got two little kids.\nInstead, he gives his kids to a stranger,\njumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks,\nlies on him, the subway goes over him.\nWesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height.\nThe train clearance is 21 inches.\nA half an inch would have taken his head off.\nAnd he said, "I did what anyone could do,"\nno big deal to jump on the tracks.'
p1996
aS'\nAnd the moral imperative is "I did what everyone should do."\nAnd so one day, you will be in a new situation.\nTake path one, you\'re going to be a perpetrator of evil.\nEvil, meaning you\'re going to be Arthur Andersen.\nYou\'re going to cheat, or you\'re going to allow bullying.\nPath two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction.\nPath three, you become a hero.\nThe point is, are we ready to take the path\nto celebrating ordinary heroes,\nwaiting for the right situation to come along\nto put heroic imagination into action?\nBecause it may only happen once in your life,\nand when you pass it by, you\'ll always know,\nI could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.\nSo the point is thinking it and then doing it.'
p1997
aS"\nSo I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nLet's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad,\nand let's focus on the positive.\nAdvocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace,\nwhich sadly our administration has not been doing.\nThanks so much.\n(Applause)"

aS"\nI moved to America 12 years ago\nwith my wife Terry and our two kids.\nActually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles -- (Laughter) --\nthinking we were moving to America,\nbut anyway, it's a short plane ride from Los Angeles\nto America."
p2001
aS'\nI got here 12 years ago,\nand when I got here, I was told various things,\nlike, "Americans don\'t get irony."\nHave you come across this idea?\nIt\'s not true. I\'ve traveled the whole length and breadth of this country.\nI have found no evidence that Americans don\'t get irony.\nIt\'s one of those cultural myths,\nlike, "The British are reserved."\nI don\'t know why people think this.\nWe\'ve invaded every country we\'ve encountered.\n(Laughter)\nBut it\'s not true Americans don\'t get irony,\nbut I just want you to know that that\'s what people\nare saying about you behind your back.\nYou know, so when you leave living rooms in Europe,\npeople say, thankfully, nobody was ironic in your presence.'
p2002
aS"\nBut I knew that Americans get irony\nwhen I came across that legislation No Child Left Behind.\nBecause whoever thought of that title gets irony,\ndon't they, because --\n(Laughter) (Applause) \nbecause it's leaving millions of children behind.\nNow I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation:\nMillions of Children Left Behind. I can see that.\nWhat's the plan? Well, we propose\nto leave millions of children behind,\nand here's how it's going to work."
p2003
aS"\nAnd it's working beautifully.\nIn some parts of the country,\n60 percent of kids drop out of high school.\nIn the Native American communities,\nit's 80 percent of kids.\nIf we halved that number, one estimate is\nit would create a net gain to the U.S. economy\nover 10 years of nearly a trillion dollars.\nFrom an economic point of view,\nthis is good math, isn't it, that we should do this?\nIt actually costs an enormous amount\nto mop up the damage from the dropout crisis."
p2004
aS"\nBut the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg.\nWhat it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school\nbut being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it,\nwho don't get any real benefit from it."
p2005
aS"\nAnd the reason is\nnot that we're not spending enough money.\nAmerica spends more money on education\nthan most other countries.\nClass sizes are smaller than in many countries.\nAnd there are hundreds of initiatives every year\nto try and improve education.\nThe trouble is, it's all going in the wrong direction.\nThere are three principles\non which human life flourishes,\nand they are contradicted by the culture of education\nunder which most teachers have to labor\nand most students have to endure."
p2006
aS'\nThe first is this, that human beings\nare naturally different and diverse.'
p2007
aS'\nCan I ask you, how many of you\nhave got children of your own?\nOkay. Or grandchildren.\nHow about two children or more? Right.\nAnd the rest of you have seen such children.\n(Laughter)\nSmall people wandering about.\nI will make you a bet,\nand I am confident that I will win the bet.\nIf you\'ve got two children or more,\nI bet you they are completely different from each other.\nAren\'t they? Aren\'t they? (Applause)\nYou would never confuse them, would you?\nLike, "Which one are you? Remind me.\nYour mother and I are going to introduce\nsome color-coding system, so we don\'t get confused."'
p2008
aS"\nEducation under No Child Left Behind\nis based on not diversity but conformity.\nWhat schools are encouraged to do is to find out\nwhat kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.\nOne of the effects of No Child Left Behind\nhas been to narrow the focus\nonto the so-called STEM disciplines. They're very important.\nI'm not here to argue against science and math.\nOn the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient.\nA real education has to give equal weight\nto the arts, the humanities, to physical education.\nAn awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you  (Applause) \nOne estimate in America currently is that\nsomething like 10 percent of kids, getting on that way,\nare being diagnosed with various conditions\nunder the broad title of attention deficit disorder.\nADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing.\nI just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.\nIf you sit kids down, hour after hour,\ndoing low-grade clerical work,\ndon't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know?\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nChildren are not, for the most part,\nsuffering from a psychological condition.\nThey're suffering from childhood. (Laughter)\nAnd I know this because I spent my early life\nas a child. I went through the whole thing.\nKids prosper best with a broad curriculum\nthat celebrates their various talents,\nnot just a small range of them.\nAnd by the way, the arts aren't just important\nbecause they improve math scores.\nThey're important because they speak to parts\nof children's being which are otherwise untouched."
p2009
aS'\nThe second, thank you  (Applause)'
p2010
aS"\nThe second principle that drives human life flourishing\nis curiosity.\nIf you can light the spark of curiosity in a child,\nthey will learn without any further assistance, very often.\nChildren are natural learners.\nIt's a real achievement to put that particular ability out,\nor to stifle it.\nCuriosity is the engine of achievement.\nNow the reason I say this is because\none of the effects of the current culture here, if I can say so,\nhas been to de-professionalize teachers.\nThere is no system in the world\nor any school in the country\nthat is better than its teachers.\nTeachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools.\nBut teaching is a creative profession.\nTeaching, properly conceived, is not a delivery system.\nYou know, you're not there just to pass on received information.\nGreat teachers do that,\nbut what great teachers also do is mentor,\nstimulate, provoke, engage.\nYou see, in the end, education is about learning.\nIf there's no learning going on,\nthere's no education going on.\nAnd people can spend an awful lot of time\ndiscussing education without ever discussing learning.\nThe whole point of education is to get people to learn."
p2011
aS'\nA friend of mine, an old friend -- actually very old,\nhe\'s dead. (Laughter)\nThat\'s as old as it gets, I\'m afraid.\nBut a wonderful guy he was, wonderful philosopher.\nHe used to talk about the difference between the task\nand achievement senses of verbs.\nYou know, you can be engaged in the activity of something,\nbut not really be achieving it,\nlike dieting. It\'s a very good example, you know.\nThere he is. He\'s dieting. Is he losing any weight? Not really.\nTeaching is a word like that.\nYou can say, "There\'s Deborah, she\'s in room 34, she\'s teaching."\nBut if nobody\'s learning anything,\nshe may be engaged in the task of teaching\nbut not actually fulfilling it.'
p2012
aS"\nThe role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. That's it.\nAnd part of the problem is, I think,\nthat the dominant culture of education has come to focus\non not teaching and learning, but testing.\nNow, testing is important. Standardized tests have a place.\nBut they should not be the dominant culture of education.\nThey should be diagnostic. They should help.\n(Applause)\nIf I go for a medical examination,\nI want some standardized tests. I do.\nYou know, I want to know what my cholesterol level is\ncompared to everybody else's on a standard scale.\nI don't want to be told on some scale\nmy doctor invented in the car."
p2013
aS'\n"Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange."'
p2014
aS'\n"Really? Is that good?""We don\'t know."'
p2015
aS"\nBut all that should support learning. It shouldn't obstruct it,\nwhich of course it often does.\nSo in place of curiosity, what we have\nis a culture of compliance.\nOur children and teachers are encouraged\nto follow routine algorithms\nrather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity.\nAnd the third principle is this:\nthat human life is inherently creative.\nIt's why we all have different rsums.\nWe create our lives,\nand we can recreate them as we go through them.\nIt's the common currency of being a human being.\nIt's why human culture is so interesting and diverse\nand dynamic.\nI mean, other animals may well have imaginations\nand creativity, but it's not so much in evidence,\nis it, as ours?\nI mean, you may have a dog.\nAnd your dog may get depressed.\nYou know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?\n(Laughter)\nAnd sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.\n(Laughter)"
p2016
aS'\nAnd you say, "Would you like to come for a walk?"'
p2017
aS'\nHe says, "No, I\'m fine.\nYou go. I\'ll wait. But take pictures."'
p2018
aS'\nWe all create our own lives through this restless process\nof imagining alternatives and possibilities,\nand what one of the roles of education\nis to awaken and develop these powers of creativity.\nInstead, what we have is a culture of standardization.'
p2019
aS"\nNow, it doesn't have to be that way. It really doesn't.\nFinland regularly comes out on top\nin math, science and reading.\nNow, we only know that's what they do well at\nbecause that's all that's being tested currently.\nThat's one of the problems of the test.\nThey don't look for other things that matter just as much.\nThe thing about work in Finland is this:\nthey don't obsess about those disciplines.\nThey have a very broad approach to education\nwhich includes humanities, physical education, the arts."
p2020
aS"\nSecond, there is no standardized testing in Finland.\nI mean, there's a bit,\nbut it's not what gets people up in the morning.\nIt's not what keeps them at their desks."
p2021
aS'\nAnd the third thing, and I was at a meeting recently\nwith some people from Finland, actual Finnish people,\nand somebody from the American system\nwas saying to the people in Finland,\n"What do you do about the dropout rate in Finland?"'
p2022
aS'\nAnd they all looked a bit bemused, and said,\n"Well, we don\'t have one.\nWhy would you drop out?\nIf people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly\nand help them and we support them."'
p2023
aS'\nNow people always say, "Well, you know,\nyou can\'t compare Finland to America."'
p2024
aS"\nNo. I think there's a population\nof around five million in Finland.\nBut you can compare it to a state in America.\nMany states in America have fewer people in them than that.\nI mean, I've been to some states in America\nand I was the only person there. (Laughter)\nReally. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left.\n(Laughter)"
p2025
aS"\nBut what all the high-performing systems in the world do\nis currently what is not evident, sadly,\nacross the systems in America -- I mean, as a whole.\nOne is this: They individualize teaching and learning.\nThey recognize that it's students who are learning\nand the system has to engage them, their curiosity,\ntheir individuality, and their creativity.\nThat's how you get them to learn."
p2026
aS"\nThe second is that they attribute a very high status\nto the teaching profession.\nThey recognize that you can't improve education\nif you don't pick great people to teach\nand if you don't keep giving them constant support\nand professional development.\nInvesting in professional development is not a cost.\nIt's an investment,\nand every other country that's succeeding well knows that,\nwhether it's Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore,\nHong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case."
p2027
aS"\nAnd the third is, they devolve responsibility\nto the school level for getting the job done.\nYou see, there's a big difference here between\ngoing into a mode of command and control in education --\nThat's what happens in some systems.\nYou know, central governments decide\nor state governments decide\nthey know best and they're going to tell you what to do.\nThe trouble is that education doesn't go on\nin the committee rooms of our legislative buildings.\nIt happens in classrooms and schools,\nand the people who do it are the teachers and the students,\nand if you remove their discretion, it stops working.\nYou have to put it back to the people.\n(Applause)"
p2028
aS"\nThere is wonderful work happening in this country.\nBut I have to say it's happening\nin spite of the dominant culture of education,\nnot because of it.\nIt's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time.\nAnd the reason I think is this:\nthat many of the current policies are based on\nmechanistic conceptions of education.\nIt's like education is an industrial process\nthat can be improved just by having better data,\nand somewhere in, I think, the back of the mind\nof some policy makers is this idea that\nif we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right,\nit will all hum along perfectly into the future.\nIt won't, and it never did."
p2029
aS'\nThe point is that education is not a mechanical system.\nIt\'s a human system. It\'s about people,\npeople who either do want to learn or don\'t want to learn.\nEvery student who drops out of school has a reason for it\nwhich is rooted in their own biography.\nThey may find it boring. They may find it irrelevant.\nThey may find that it\'s at odds\nwith the life they\'re living outside of school.\nThere are trends, but the stories are always unique.\nI was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of --\nthey\'re called alternative education programs.\nThese are programs designed to get kids back into education.\nThey have certain common features.\nThey\'re very personalized.\nThey have strong support for the teachers,\nclose links with the community\nand a broad and diverse curriculum,\nand often programs which involve students\noutside school as well as inside school.\nAnd they work.\nWhat\'s interesting to me is,\nthese are called "alternative education."\nYou know?\nAnd all the evidence from around the world is,\nif we all did that, there\'d be no need for the alternative.\n(Applause)'
p2030
aS"\nSo I think we have to embrace a different metaphor.\nWe have to recognize that it's a human system,\nand there are conditions under which people thrive,\nand conditions under which they don't.\nWe are after all organic creatures,\nand the culture of the school is absolutely essential.\nCulture is an organic term, isn't it?"
p2031
aS"\nNot far from where I live is a place called Death Valley.\nDeath Valley is the hottest, driest place in America,\nand nothing grows there.\nNothing grows there because it doesn't rain.\nHence, Death Valley.\nIn the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley.\nSeven inches of rain fell over a very short period.\nAnd in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon.\nThe whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers\nfor a while.\nWhat it proved is this: that Death Valley isn't dead.\nIt's dormant.\nRight beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility\nwaiting for the right conditions to come about,\nand with organic systems, if the conditions are right,\nlife is inevitable. It happens all the time.\nYou take an area, a school, a district,\nyou change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility,\na different set of expectations,\na broader range of opportunities,\nyou cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners,\nyou offer people the discretion to be creative\nand to innovate in what they do,\nand schools that were once bereft spring to life."
p2032
aS"\nGreat leaders know that.\nThe real role of leadership in education --\nand I think it's true at the national level, the state level,\nat the school level --\nis not and should not be command and control.\nThe real role of leadership is climate control,\ncreating a climate of possibility.\nAnd if you do that, people will rise to it\nand achieve things that you \ncompletely did not anticipate\nand couldn't have expected."
p2033
aS'\nThere\'s a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.\n"There are three sorts of people in the world:\nThose who are immovable,\npeople who don\'t get it, they don\'t want to get it,\nthey\'re not going to do anything about it;\nthere are people who are movable,\npeople who see the need for change\nand are prepared to listen to it;\nand there are people who move,\npeople who make things happen."\nAnd if we can encourage more people,\nthat will be a movement.\nAnd if the movement is strong enough,\nthat\'s, in the best sense of the word, a revolution.\nAnd that\'s what we need.'

p2037

p2038
aS'\nThat\'s true in everything risky except technology.\nFor some reason, there\'s no standard syllabus,\nthere\'s no basic course.\nThey just sort of give you your computer\nand then kick you out of the nest.\nYou\'re supposed to learn this stuff how?\nJust by osmosis. Nobody ever sits down\nand tells you, "This is how it works."\nSo today I\'m going to tell you 10 things\nthat you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don\'t.'
p2039
aS"\nAll right, first of all, on the web, when you're on the web\nand you want to scroll down, don't pick up the mouse\nand use the scroll bar. That's a terrible waste of time.\nDo that only if you're paid by the hour.\nInstead, hit the space bar.\nThe space bar scrolls down one page.\nHold down the Shift key to scroll back up again.\nSo space bar to scroll down one page.\nIt works in every browser on every kind of computer."
p2040
aS"\nAlso on the web, when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses,\nI assume you know that you can hit the Tab key\nto jump from box to box to box.\nBut what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state?\nDon't open the pop-up menu. That's a terrible waste of calories.\nType the first letter of your state over and over and over.\nSo if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.\nIf you want Texas, go T, T, and you jump right\nto that thing without even opening the pop-up menu."
p2041
aS"\nAlso on the web, when the text is too small,\nwhat you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus, plus, plus.\nYou make the text larger with each tap.\nIt works on every computer, every web browser,\nor minus, minus, minus to get smaller again.\nIf you're on the Mac, it might be Command instead."
p2042
aS"\nWhen you're typing on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,\ndon't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout\nto hit the period and then a space and then try to capitalize the next letter.\nJust hit the space bar twice.\nThe phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you.\nGo space, space. It is totally amazing."
p2043
aS"\nAlso when it comes to cell phones, on all phones,\nif you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before,\nall you have to do is hit the call button,\nand it puts the last phone number into the box for you,\nand at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it.\nSo you don't need to go into the recent calls list,\nso if you're trying to get through to somebody,\njust hit the call button again."
p2044
aS'\nHere\'s something that drives me crazy.\nWhen I call you and leave a message on your voicemail,\nI hear you saying, "Leave a message,"\nand then I get these 15 seconds of frickin\' instructions,\nlike we haven\'t had answering machines for 45 years!\n(Laughter)\nI\'m not bitter.\nSo it turns out there\'s a keyboard shortcut\nthat lets you jump directly to the beep like this.'

S'\nThe human voice:\nIt\'s the instrument we all play.\nIt\'s the most powerful sound in the world, probably.\nIt\'s the only one that can start a war\nor say "I love you."\nAnd yet many people have the experience\nthat when they speak, people don\'t listen to them.\nAnd why is that?\nHow can we speak powerfully\nto make change in the world?'
p2056
aS"\nWhat I'd like to suggest, there are\na number of habits that we need to move away from.\nI've assembled for your pleasure here\nseven deadly sins of speaking.\nI'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,\nbut these seven, I think, are pretty large\nhabits that we can all fall into."
p2057
aS"\nFirst, gossip,\nspeaking ill of somebody who's not present.\nNot a nice habit, and we know perfectly well\nthe person gossiping five minutes later\nwill be gossiping about us."
p2058
aS"\nSecond, judging.\nWe know people who are like this in conversation,\nand it's very hard to listen to somebody\nif you know that you're being judged\nand found wanting at the same time."
p2059
aS'\nThird, negativity.\nYou can fall into this.\nMy mother, in the last years of her life,\nbecame very, very negative, and it\'s hard to listen.\nI remember one day, I said to her,\n"It\'s October 1 today,"\nand she said, "I know, isn\'t it dreadful?"\n(Laughter)\nIt\'s hard to listen when somebody\'s that negative.'
p2060
aS"\nAnd another form of negativity, complaining.\nWell, this is the national art of the U.K.\nIt's our national sport. We\ncomplain about the weather,\nabout sport, about politics, about everything,\nbut actually complaining is viral misery.\nIt's not spreading sunshine\nand lightness in the world."
p2061
aS"\nExcuses. We've all met this guy.\nMaybe we've all been this guy.\nSome people have a blamethrower.\nThey just pass it on to everybody else\nand don't take responsibility for their actions,\nand again, hard to listen to\nsomebody who is being like that."
p2062
aS"\nPenultimate, the sixth of the seven,\nembroidery, exaggeration.\nIt demeans our language, actually, sometimes.\nFor example, if I see something\nthat really is awesome,\nwhat do I call it?\n(Laughter)\nAnd then of course this exaggeration becomes lying,\nout and out lying, and we don't want to listen\nto people we know are lying to us."
p2063
aS"\nAnd finally, dogmatism,\nthe confusion of facts with opinions.\nWhen those two things get conflated,\nyou're listening into the wind.\nYou know, somebody is bombarding you\nwith their opinions as if they were true.\nIt's difficult to listen to that."
p2064
aS'\nSo here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.\nThese are things I think we need to avoid.\nBut is there a positive way to think about this?\nYes, there is.\nI\'d like to suggest that there are four\nreally powerful cornerstones, foundations,\nthat we can stand on if we want our speech\nto be powerful and to make change in the world.\nFortunately, these things spell a word.\nThe word is "hail," and it has\na great definition as well.\nI\'m not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky\nand hits you on the head.\nI\'m talking about this definition,\nto greet or acclaim enthusiastically,\nwhich is how I think our words will be received\nif we stand on these four things.'
p2065
aS"\nSo what do they stand for?\nSee if you can guess.\nThe H, honesty, of course,\nbeing true in what you say, being straight and clear.\nThe A is authenticity, just being yourself.\nA friend of mine described it as\nstanding in your own truth,\nwhich I think is a lovely way to put it.\nThe I is integrity, being your word,\nactually doing what you say,\nand being somebody people can trust.\nAnd the L is love.\nI don't mean romantic love,\nbut I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.\nFirst of all, I think absolute honesty\nmay not be what we want.\nI mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.\nPerhaps that's not necessary.\nTempered with love, of course,\nhonesty is a great thing.\nBut also, if you're really wishing somebody well,\nit's very hard to judge them at the same time.\nI'm not even sure you can do those two things\nsimultaneously.\nSo hail."
p2066
aS"\nAlso, now that's what you say,\nand it's like the old song, it is what you say,\nit's also the way that you say it.\nYou have an amazing toolbox.\nThis instrument is incredible,\nand yet this is a toolbox that very\nfew people have ever opened.\nI'd like to have a little rummage in there\nwith you now and just pull a few tools out\nthat you might like to take away and play with,\nwhich will increase the power of your speaking."
p2067
aS"\nRegister, for example.\nNow, falsetto register may not\nbe very useful most of the time,\nbut there's a register in between.\nI'm not going to get very technical about this\nfor any of you who are voice coaches.\nYou can locate your voice, however.\nSo if I talk up here in my nose,\nyou can hear the difference.\nIf I go down here in my throat,\nwhich is where most of us\nspeak from most of the time.\nBut if you want weight,\nyou need to go down here to the chest.\nYou hear the difference?\nWe vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,\nbecause we associate depth with power\nand with authority.\nThat's register."

aS"\nThen we have timbre.\nIt's the way your voice feels.\nAgain, the research shows that we prefer voices\nwhich are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate.\nWell if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,\nbecause you can train.\nGo and get a voice coach.\nAnd there are amazing things you can do\nwith breathing, with posture, and with exercises\nto improve the timbre of your voice."
p2069
aS"\nThen prosody. I love prosody.\nThis is the sing-song, the meta-language\nthat we use in order to impart meaning.\nIt's root one for meaning in conversation.\nPeople who speak all on one note\nare really quite hard to listen to\nif they don't have any prosody at all.\nThat's where the world monotonic comes from,\nor monotonous, monotone.\nAlso we have repetitive prosody now coming in,\nwhere every sentence ends as if it were a question\nwhen it's actually not a question, it's a statement.\n(Laughter)\nAnd if you repeat that one over and over,\nit's actually restricting your ability\nto communicate through prosody,\nwhich I think is a shame,\nso let's try and break that habit."
p2070
aS"\nPace. I can get very, very excited\nby saying something really, really quickly,\nor I can slow right down to emphasize,\nand at the end of that, of course, is our old friend\nsilence.\nThere's nothing wrong with a bit of silence\nin a talk, is there?\nWe don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.\nIt can be very powerful."
p2071
aS'\nOf course, pitch often goes along with pace\nto indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.\nWhere did you leave my keys?\nWhere did you leave my keys?\nSo slightly different meaning\nin those two deliveries.'
p2072
aS"\nAnd finally, volume.\nI can get really excited by using volume.\nSorry about that if I startled anybody.\nOr, I can have you really pay attention\nby getting very quiet.\nSome people broadcast the whole time.\nTry not to do that.\nThat's called sodcasting,\nimposing your sound on people around you\ncarelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice."
p2073
aS"\nOf course, where this all comes into play most of all\nis when you've got something really important to do.\nIt might be standing on a stage like this\nand giving a talk to people.\nIt might be proposing marriage,\nasking for a raise, a wedding speech.\nWhatever it is, if it's really important,\nyou owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox\nand the engine that it's going to work on,\nand no engine works well without being warmed up.\nWarm up your voice."
p2074
aS'\nActually, let me show you how to do that.\nWould you all like to stand up for a moment?\nI\'m going to show you the\nsix vocal warmup exercises\nthat I do before every talk I ever do.\nAnytime you\'re going to talk to\nanybody important, do these.\nFirst, arms up, deep breath in,\nand sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.\nOne more time.\nAhhhh, very good.\nNow we\'re going to warm up our lips,\nand we\'re going to go ba, ba, ba, ba,\nba, ba, ba, ba. Very good.\nAnd now, brrrrrrrrrr,\njust like when you were a kid.\nBrrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.\nWe\'re going to do the tongue next\nwith exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.\nBeautiful. You\'re getting really good at this.\nAnd then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.\nThat\'s like champagne for the tongue.\nFinally, and if I can only do one,\nthe pros call this the siren.\nIt\'s really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."\nThe "we" is high, the "aw" is low.\nSo you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.'

p2077
aS"\nNow let me just put this in context to close.\nThis is a serious point here.\nThis is where we are now, right?\nWe speak not very well\ninto people who simply aren't listening\nin an environment that's all\nabout noise and bad acoustics.\nI have talked about that on this stage\nin different phases.\nWhat would the world be like\nif we were speaking powerfully\nto people who were listening consciously\nin environments which were actually fit for purpose?\nOr to make that a bit larger,\nwhat would the world be like\nif we were creating sound consciously\nand consuming sound consciously\nand designing all our environments\nconsciously for sound?\nThat would be a world that does sound beautiful,\nand one where understanding\nwould be the norm,\nand that is an idea worth spreading."

aa(lp2081
S'\nHey, I am Michael Shermer, the director of the Skeptics Society,\nthe publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.\nWe investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science,\nand fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between --\nscience and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science,\nvoodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science\nand plain old nonsense.\nAnd unless you\'ve been on Mars recently,\nyou know there\'s a lot of that out there.'
p2082
aS"\nSome people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.\nBut let's face it -- there's a lot of bunk,\nand we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there, flushing out.\nWell, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas\n(Laughter)\n-- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas."
p2083
aS"\nI'll show you an example of a bad idea.\nI brought this with me.\nThis was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.\nIt's the -- it's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.\nIt's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.\n(Laughter)\nThis was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece.\nIt's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.\nYou could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one\nwas built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.\n(Laughter)"
p2084
aS"\nSo the way it works is, you go down the hallway and you see if\nit tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker.\nSo it looks something like this.\nI'll show you.\n(Laughter)\nNo, it -- well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.\nSo, I'll show -- well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.\nIt'll go this way for sure.\n(Laughter)"
p2085
aS'\nSir, you want to empty your pockets. Please, sir?\n(Laughter)'
p2086
aS"\nSo the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?\nAnd the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)"
p2087
aS"\nBut in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.\nAnd that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here, is that\nthis is how psychics work, astrologers, and tarot card readers and so on.\nPeople remember the hits; they forget the misses.\nIn science we have to keep the whole database,\nand look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out\nfrom the total number that you would expect by chance."
p2088
aS"\nIn this case, we tested it.\nWe had two opaque boxes:\none with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.\nAnd it got it 50 percent of the time --\nwhich is exactly what you'd expect with a coin flip model.\nSo that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do."
p2089
aS'\n"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.\nEach one has a particular theme, like this one is on the future of intelligence.\nAre people getting smarter or dumber?\nI have an opinion of this myself because of the business I\'m in,\nbut, in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.\nThree IQ points per 10 years, going up.\nSort of an interesting thing.'
p2090
aS"\nWith science, don't think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing.\nAre science and religion compatible?\nIt's like, are science and plumbing compatible?\nThese -- they're just two different things.\nScience is not a thing. It's a verb.\nIt's a way of thinking about things.\nIt's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena."
p2091
aS'\nI mean, what\'s more likely:\nthat extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across\nthe vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle\nin Farmer Bob\'s field in Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skeptic.com, our webpage?\nOr is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?\nAnd in all cases we have to ask\n(Laughter)\n-- what\'s the more likely explanation?\nAnd before we say something is out of this world,\nwe should first make sure that it\'s not in this world.\nWhat\'s more likely --\nthat Arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship?\nOr that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?\n(Laughter)'
p2092
aS'\nAnd part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely\nhere in this Sidney Harris cartoon.\nFor those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.\nI think you need to be more explicit here in step two."\nThis single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments.\nThere\'s nothing more to it than that.\n(Applause)\nYou can say a miracle occurs.\nIt\'s just that it doesn\'t explain anything.\nIt doesn\'t offer anything. There\'s nothing to test.\nIt\'s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.'
p2093
aS"\nWhereas -- and it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as\nlinguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that --\nuntil we figure out what it is, we'll just call it this --\nit's the beginning of the causal chain for science.\nFor intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.\nSo again, we can ask this: what's more likely?\nAre UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes -- or even fakes?"
p2094
aS"\nThis is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California,\nlooking down over Pasadena.\nAnd if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.\nYou don't even need Photoshop; you don't need high-tech equipment;\nyou don't need computers.\nThis was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.\nYou just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.\nCamera's ready -- that's it.\n(Laughter)"
p2095
aS"\nSo, although it's possible that most of these things are fake\nor illusions or so on and that some of them are real,\nit's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles."
p2096
aS'\nOn a more serious note, in all of science we\'re looking for a balance\nbetween data and theory.\nIn the case of Galileo, he had two problems\nwhen he turned his telescope to Saturn.\nFirst of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.\nAnd second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy,\nand he couldn\'t quite make out what it was he was looking at.\nSo he wrote that he had seen --\n"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."\nAnd this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.\nSo without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data,\nyou can\'t have a good theory.\nAnd it wasn\'t solved until 1655.'
p2097
aS"\nThis is Christiaan Huygens's book in which he cataloged all the mistakes\nthat people made in trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.\nIt wasn't till -- Huygens had two things.\nHe had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated.\nAnd then, he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data\nin which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster --\naccording to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn, then we catch up with it.\nAnd we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.\nAnd that, in fact, turns out to be true."
p2098
aS"\nThe problems with having a theory\nis that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases.\nSo one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things\nis that we have things on a simple level.\nAnd then I'll go to more serious ones.\nLike, we have a tendency to see faces."
p2099
aS"\nThis is the face on Mars, which was --\nin 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA\nto photograph that area because people thought\nthis was monumental architecture made by Martians.\nWell, it turns out -- here's the close-up of it from 2001.\nIf you squint, you can still see the face.\nAnd when you're squinting, what you're doing is\nyou're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain.\nAnd so, you're reducing the quality of your data.\nAnd if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face,\nbecause we're programmed by evolution to see faces."
p2100
aS"\nFaces are important for us socially.\nAnd, of course, happy faces.\nFaces of all kinds are easy to see.\n(Laughter)\nYou can see the happy face on Mars, there.\nIf astronomers were frogs perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.\nDo you see him there?\nLittle froggy legs.\nOr if geologists were elephants?"
p2101
aS"\nReligious iconography.\n(Laughter)\nDiscovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.\nHe charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun\ntill he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.\nHere's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,\nor is it up the street from here?\nTree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy,\nblack-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking --\nhumans are pattern-seeking animals."
p2102
aS"\nHere's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.\nNow, here's the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich --\nwhich I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino,\nof course, this being America.\n(Laughter)\nThis casino paid 28,500 dollars on eBay for the cheese sandwich.\n(Laughter)\nBut who does it really look like, the Virgin Mary?\n(Laughter)\nIt has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look."
p2103
aS"\nVirgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.\nI actually went to see this one.\nThere was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their --\nwheelchairs and crutches, and so on.\nAnd we went down, investigated.\nJust to give you a size -- that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi,\nnext to this two, two and a half story size image.\nAll these candles, so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.\nSo we walked around the backside, just to see what was going on here,\nwhere -- it turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree,\nyou get the effect.\nHere's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.\nI guess you can only have one miracle per building.\n(Laughter)\nSo is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?\n(Laughter)"
p2104
aS'\nAnd then I\'m going to finish up with another example of this\nwith audio -- auditory illusions.\nThere is this film, "White Noise,"\nwith Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us.\nBy the way, this whole business of talking to the dead, it\'s not that big a deal.\nAnybody can do it, turns out.\nIt\'s getting the dead to talk back that\'s the really hard part.\n(Laughter)'
p2105
aS"\nIn this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.\nThere's a ReverseSpeech.com web page from which I downloaded this stuff.\nHere is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these.\nHere's the forward version of the very famous song. (Music)\nBoy, couldn't you just listen to that all day?\n(Laughter)"

aS"\nYou can't miss it when I tell you what's there.\n(Laughter)"
p2110
aS"\nAll right, I'm going to just end with a positive, nice, little story\nabout -- the Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.\nWe're always looking for little, good things that people do."
p2111
aS'\nAnd in England, there\'s a pop singer.\nVery -- one of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.\nAnd she wrote a beautiful song.\nIt was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."\nIt\'s a love story -- she\'s sort of the Norah Jones of the U.K. --\nabout how she much loves her guy,\nand compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.\nAnd she has this one passage here.'
p2112
aS'\n We are 12 billion light-years from the edge '
p2113
aS"\n That's a guess "
p2114
aS"\n No one can ever say it's true "
p2115
aS'\n But I know that I will always be with you '
p2116
aS'\nWell, that\'s nice.\nAt least she got it close.\nIn America it would be, "We\'re 6,000 light years from the edge."'
p2117
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2118
aS'\nBut my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator,\nand he wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on.\nHe uses every chance he gets to promote good science.\nAnd so, he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie\'s song,\nin which he said, well, we know exactly how old, how far from the edge.\nYou know, it\'s 12 -- it\'s 13.7 billion light years, and it\'s not a guess.\nWe know within precise error bars there how close it is.\nAnd so, we can say, although not absolutely true, that it\'s pretty close to being true.'
p2119
aS'\nAnd, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out.\nAnd said, "I\'m so embarrassed.\nI was a member of the astronomy club, and I should have known better."\nAnd she re-cut the song.\nSo I\'ll end with the new version.\n We are 13.7 billion light years \n from the edge of the observable universe \n That\'s a good estimate with well-defined error bars \n And with the available information \n I predict that I will always be with you \n(Applause)'
p2120
aS'\nHow cool is that?\n(Applause)'
p2121
aa(lp2122
S"\nThere is something\nyou know about me, something very personal,\nand there is something I know about\nevery one of you\nand that's very central to your concerns.\nThere is something that we know\nabout everyone we meet anywhere in the world,\non the street,\nthat is the very mainspring\nof whatever they do\nand whatever they put up with,\nand that is that all of us\nwant to be happy.\nIn this, we are all together.\nHow we imagine our happiness,\nthat differs from one another,\nbut it's already a lot that we have all in common,\nthat we want to be happy."
p2123
aS"\nNow my topic is gratefulness.\nHow is the connection between\nhappiness and gratefulness?\nMany people would say, well, that's very easy.\nWhen you are happy, you are grateful.\nBut think again.\nIs it really the happy people that are grateful?\nWe all know quite a number of people\nwho have everything that it would take to be happy,\nand they are not happy,\nbecause they want something else\nor they want more of the same.\nAnd we all know people\nwho have lots of misfortune,\nmisfortune that we ourselves would not want to have,\nand they are deeply happy.\nThey radiate happiness. You are surprised.\nWhy? Because they are grateful.\nSo it is not happiness that makes us grateful.\nIt's gratefulness that makes us happy.\nIf you think it's happiness that makes you grateful,\nthink again.\nIt's gratefulness that makes you happy."
p2124
aS"\nNow, we can ask,\nwhat really do we mean by gratefulness?\nAnd how does it work?\nI appeal to your own experience.\nWe all know from experience how it goes.\nWe experience something\nthat's valuable to us.\nSomething is given to us that's valuable to us.\nAnd it's really given.\nThese two things have to come together.\nIt has to be something valuable,\nand it's a real gift.\nYou haven't bought it. You haven't earned it.\nYou haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it.\nIt's just given to you.\nAnd when these two things come together,\nsomething that's really valuable to me\nand I realize it's freely given,\nthen gratefulness spontaneously\nrises in my heart,\nhappiness spontaneously rises in my heart.\nThat's how gratefulness happens."
p2125
aS"\nNow the key to all this is that\nwe cannot only experience this once in a while.\nWe cannot only have grateful experiences.\nWe can be people who live gratefully.\nGrateful living, that is the thing.\nAnd how can we live gratefully?\nBy experiencing, by becoming aware\nthat every moment is a given moment, as we say.\nIt's a gift. You haven't earned it.\nYou haven't brought it about in any way.\nYou have no way of assuring that there will be\nanother moment given to you,\nand yet, that's the most valuable thing\nthat can ever be given to us,\nthis moment, with all the opportunity that it contains.\nIf we didn't have this present moment,\nwe wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything\nor experience anything,\nand this moment is a gift.\nIt's a given moment, as we say."
p2126
aS"\nNow, we say the gift within this gift\nis really the opportunity.\nWhat you are really grateful for is the opportunity,\nnot the thing that is given to you,\nbecause if that thing were somewhere else\nand you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it,\nto do something with it,\nyou wouldn't be grateful for it.\nOpportunity is the gift within every gift,\nand we have this saying,\nopportunity knocks only once.\nWell, think again.\nEvery moment is a new gift, over and over again,\nand if you miss the opportunity of this moment,\nanother moment is given to us, and another moment.\nWe can avail ourselves of this opportunity,\nor we can miss it,\nand if we avail ourselves of the opportunity,\nit is the key to happiness.\nBehold the master key to our happiness\nin our own hands.\nMoment by moment,\nwe can be grateful for this gift."
p2127
aS"\nDoes that mean\nthat we can be grateful for everything?\nCertainly not.\nWe cannot be grateful for violence, for war,\nfor oppression, for exploitation.\nOn the personal level, we cannot be grateful\nfor the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness,\nfor bereavement.\nBut I didn't say we can be grateful for everything.\nI said we can be grateful in every given moment\nfor the opportunity,\nand even when we are confronted\nwith something that is terribly difficult,\nwe can rise to this occasion\nand respond to the opportunity that is given to us.\nIt isn't as bad as it might seem.\nActually, when you look at it and experience it,\nyou find that most of the time, what is given to us\nis opportunity to enjoy,\nand we only miss it because\nwe are rushing through life\nand we are not stopping to see the opportunity."
p2128
aS"\nBut once in a while,\nsomething very difficult is given to us,\nand when this difficult thing occurs to us,\nit's a challenge to rise to that opportunity,\nand we can rise to it by learning something\nwhich is sometimes painful.\nLearning patience, for instance.\nWe have been told that the road to peace\nis not a sprint,\nbut is more like a marathon.\nThat takes patience. That's difficult.\nIt may be to stand up for your opinion,\nto stand up for your conviction.\nThat's an opportunity that is given to us.\nTo learn, to suffer, to stand up,\nall these opportunities are given to us,\nbut they are opportunities,\nand those who avail themselves\nof those opportunities\nare the ones that we admire.\nThey make something out of life.\nAnd those who fail get another opportunity.\nWe always get another opportunity.\nThat's the wonderful richness of life."
p2129
aS"\nSo how can we find a method\nthat will harness this?\nHow can each one of us find a method\nfor living gratefully,\nnot just once in a while being grateful,\nbut moment by moment to be grateful.\nHow can we do it?\nIt's a very simple method.\nIt's so simple that it's actually what we were told\nas children when we learned to cross the street.\nStop. Look. Go.\nThat's all.\nBut how often do we stop?\nWe rush through life. We don't stop.\nWe miss the opportunity because we don't stop.\nWe have to stop. We have to get quiet.\nAnd we have to build stop signs\ninto our lives."
p2130
aS"\nWhen I was in Africa some years ago\nand then came back,\nI noticed water.\nIn Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water.\nEvery time I turned on the faucet,\nI was overwhelmed.\nEvery time I clicked on the light,\nI was so grateful. It made me so happy.\nBut after a while, this wears off.\nSo I put little stickers on the light switch\nand on the water faucet,\nand every time I turned it on, water.\nSo leave it up to your own imagination.\nYou can find whatever works best for you,\nbut you need stop signs in your life.\nAnd when you stop,\nthen the next thing is to look.\nYou look. You open your eyes.\nYou open your ears. You open your nose.\nYou open all your senses\nfor this wonderful richness that is given to us.\nThere is no end to it,\nand that is what life is all about,\nto enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us."
p2131
aS"\nAnd then we can also open our hearts,\nour hearts for the opportunities,\nfor the opportunities also to help others,\nto make others happy, because\nnothing makes us more happy\nthan when all of us are happy.\nAnd when we open our hearts to the opportunities,\nthe opportunities invite us to do something,\nand that is the third.\nStop, look, and then go, and really do something.\nAnd what we can do is\nwhatever life offers to you in that present moment.\nMostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,\nbut sometimes it's something more difficult."
p2132
aS'\nBut whatever it is, if we take this opportunity,\nwe go with it, we are creative,\nthose are the creative people,\nand that little stop, look, go,\nis such a potent seed\nthat it can revolutionize our world.\nBecause we need, we are at the present moment\nin the middle of a change of consciousness,\nand you will be surprised if you --\nI am always surprised when I hear how many times\nthis word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.\nEverywhere you find it,\na grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness,\na cafe gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.\nYes, I have even come across a toilet paper\nthat the brand is called Thank You. (Laughter)\nThere is a wave of gratefulness because\npeople are becoming aware how important this is\nand how this can change our world.\nIt can change our world\nin immensely important ways,\nbecause if you\'re grateful, you\'re not fearful,\nand if you\'re not fearful, you\'re not violent.\nIf you\'re grateful, you act out of a sense of enough\nand not of a sense of scarcity,\nand you are willing to share.\nIf you are grateful, you are enjoying\nthe differences between people,\nand you are respectful to everybody,\nand that changes this power pyramid\nunder which we live.'
p2133
aS"\nAnd it doesn't make for equality,\nbut it makes for equal respect,\nand that is the important thing.\nThe future of the world will be a network,\nnot a pyramid, not a pyramid turned upside down.\nThe revolution of which I am speaking\nis a nonviolent revolution,\nand it's so revolutionary\nthat it even revolutionizes\nthe very concept of a revolution,\nbecause a normal revolution is one\nwhere the power pyramid is turned upside down\nand those who were on the bottom\nare now on the top\nand are doing exactly the same thing\nthat the ones did before.\nWhat we need is a networking of smaller groups,\nsmaller and smaller groups who know one another,\nwho interact with one another,\nand that is a grateful world."
p2134
aS"\nA grateful world is a world of joyful people.\nGrateful people are joyful people,\nand joyful people,\nthe more and more joyful people there are,\nthe more and more we'll have a joyful world.\nWe have a network for grateful living,\nand it has mushroomed.\nWe couldn't understand why it mushroomed.\nWe have an opportunity for people to light a candle\nwhen they are grateful for something.\nAnd there have been 15 million candles lit\nin one decade.\nPeople are becoming aware\nthat a grateful world is a happy world,\nand we all have the opportunity\nby the simple stop, look, go,\nto transform the world,\nto make it a happy place.\nAnd that is what I hope for us,\nand if this has contributed a little\nto making you want to do the same,\nstop, look, go."

aS"\nUsing the Internet, I found a variety of statistics\non pancreatic cancer,\nand what I had found shocked me.\nOver 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers\nare diagnosed late,\nwhen someone has less than a two percent chance of survival.\nWhy are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer?\nThe reason? Today's current modern medicine\nis a 60-year-old technique.\nThat's older than my dad."
p2141
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2142
aS"\nBut also, it's extremely expensive,\ncosting 800 dollars per test,\nand it's grossly inaccurate,\nmissing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.\nYour doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious\nthat you have the cancer in order to give you this test.\nLearning this, I knew there had to be a better way.\nSo I set up a scientific criteria\nas to what a sensor would have to look like\nin order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer.\nThe sensor would have to be inexpensive, rapid,\nsimple, sensitive, selective,\nand minimally invasive."
p2143
aS"\nNow, there's a reason why this test\nhasn't been updated in over six decades,\nand that's because, when we're looking for pancreatic cancer,\nwe're looking at your bloodstream,\nwhich is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein,\nand you're looking for this miniscule difference\nin this tiny amount of protein,\njust this one protein.\nThat's next to impossible."
p2144
aS"\nHowever, undeterred due to my teenage optimism --\n(Applause) \nI went online to a teenager's two best friends,\nGoogle and Wikipedia.\nI got everything for my homework from those two sources.\nAnd what I had found was an article\nthat listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins\nthat are found when you have pancreatic cancer.\nSo I decided to go and make it my new mission\nto go through all these proteins and see which ones\ncould serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer.\nAnd to make it a bit simpler for myself,\nI decided to map out a scientific criteria. And here it is.\nEssentially first, the protein would have to be found\nin all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream\nin the earliest stages, but also only in cancer."
p2145
aS"\nAnd so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task,\nand finally, on the 4,000th try,\nwhen I'm close to losing my sanity,\nI find the protein.\nAnd the name of the protein I'd located\nwas called mesothelin,\nand it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein,\nunless of course you have pancreatic,\novarian or lung cancer,\nin which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.\nBut also the key is\nthat it's found in the earliest stages of the disease,\nwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance\nof survival."
p2146
aS"\nSo now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect,\nI then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein,\nand, thus, pancreatic cancer.\nNow, my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place,\npossibly the most unlikely place for innovation:\nmy high school biology class,\nthe absolute stifler of innovation."
p2147
aS'\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p2148
aS"\nAnd I had snuck in this article on these things called\ncarbon nanotubes, and that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon\nthat's an atom thick\nand one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair.\nAnd despite their extremely small sizes,\nthey have these incredible properties.\nThey're kind of like the superheroes of material science.\nAnd while I was sneakily reading this article\nunder my desk in my biology class,\nwe were supposed to be paying attention\nto these other kind of cool molecules called antibodies.\nAnd these are pretty cool because they only react\nwith one specific protein,\nbut they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes.\nAnd so then, I was sitting in class,\nand suddenly it hit me:\nI could combine what I was reading about,\ncarbon nanotubes,\nwith what I was supposed to be thinking about, antibodies.\nEssentially, I could weave a bunch of these antibodies\ninto a network of carbon nanotubes\nsuch that you have a network\nthat only reacts with one protein,\nbut also, due to the properties of these nanotubes,\nit would change its electrical properties\nbased on the amount of protein present."
p2149
aS"\nHowever, there's a catch.\nThese networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy,\nand since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.\nSo that's why I chose to use paper.\nMaking a cancer sensor out of paper\nis about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies,\nwhich I love.\nYou start with some water, pour in some nanotubes,\nadd antibodies, mix it up,\ntake some paper, dip it, dry it,\nand you can detect cancer."
p2150
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2151
aS'\nThen, suddenly, a thought occurred\nthat kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here.\nI can\'t really do cancer research\non my kitchen countertop.\nMy mom wouldn\'t really like that.\nSo instead, I decided to go for a lab.\nSo I typed up a budget, a materials list,\na timeline, and a procedure,\nand I emailed it to 200 different professors\nat Johns Hopkins University\nand the National Institutes of Health,\nessentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.\nAnd I sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in,\nsaying, "You\'re a genius!\nYou\'re going to save us all!"'
p2152
aS'\nAnd  (Laughter)'
p2153
aS"\nThen reality took hold,\nand over the course of a month,\nI got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails.\nOne professor even went through my entire procedure,\npainstakingly -- I'm not really sure where he got all this time --\nand he went through and said why each and every step\nwas like the worst mistake I could ever make.\nClearly, the professors did not have as high\nof an opinion of my work as I did."
p2154
aS'\nHowever, there was a silver lining.\nOne professor said, "Maybe I might be able to help you, kid."\nSo I went in that direction.'
p2155
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2156
aS'\nAs you can never say no to a kid.'
p2157
aS"\nAnd so then, three months later,\nI finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy,\nand I get into his lab,\nI get all excited, and then I sit down,\nI start opening my mouth and talking,\nand five seconds later he calls in another Ph.D.\nPh.D.'s just flock into this little room,\nand they're just firing these questions at me,\nand by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car.\nThere were 20 Ph.D.'s plus me and the professor\ncrammed into this tiny office space\nwith them firing these rapid-fire questions at me,\ntrying to sink my procedure.\nHow unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh."
p2158
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2159
aS'\nHowever, subjecting myself to that interrogation,\nI answered all of their questions,\nand I guessed on quite a few but I got them right,\nand I finally landed the lab space I needed.'
p2160
aS'\nBut it was shortly afterwards that I discovered\nmy once brilliant procedure\nhad something like a million holes in it,\nand over the course of seven months,\nI painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes.'
p2161
aS'\nThe result? One small paper sensor\nthat costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.\nThis makes it 168 times faster,\nover 26,000 times less expensive,\nand over 400 times more sensitive\nthan our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection.'
p2162
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2163
aS'\nOne of the best parts of the sensor, though,\nis that it has close to 100 percent accuracy,\nand can detect the cancer in the earliest stages\nwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.\nAnd so in the next two to five years,\nthis sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates\nfrom a dismal 5.5 percent\nto close to 100 percent,\nand it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer.'
p2164
aS"\nBut it wouldn't stop there.\nBy switching out that antibody,\nyou can look at a different protein,\nthus, a different disease,\npotentially any disease in the entire world.\nSo that ranges from heart disease\nto malaria, HIV, AIDS,\nas well as other forms of cancer -- anything."
p2165
aS"\nAnd so hopefully one day\nwe can all have that one extra uncle,\nthat one mother, that one brother, sister,\nwe can have that one more family member to love,\nand that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden\nthat comes from pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer,\nand potentially any disease,\nthat through the Internet anything is possible.\nTheories can be shared,\nand you don't have to be a professor\nwith multiple degrees to have your ideas valued.\nIt's a neutral space,\nwhere what you look like, age or gender,\nit doesn't matter.\nIt's just your ideas that count.\nFor me, it's all about looking at the Internet\nin an entirely new way\nto realize that there's so much more to it\nthan just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online.\nYou could be changing the world."
p2166
aS"\nSo if a 15-year-old\nwho didn't even know what a pancreas was\ncould find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer,\njust imagine what you could do."
p2167
aS'\nThank you.'

aa(lp2170
S'\nI\'m going to give you four specific examples -- and I\'m going to cover at the end --\nabout how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing,\nhow an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody\nto making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact,\nto how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.\nAnd one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years,\na record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."'
p2171
aS"\nBefore I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.\nNow, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s\nI wonder what they said?\nLike the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something.\nBut this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread,\nand he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.\nAnd the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this --\nthat for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available\nno one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure.\nAnd the reason is that until Wonder came along\nand figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.\nThat the success of sliced bread,\nlike the success of almost everything we've been talking about at this conference,\nis not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like --\nit's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.\nAnd I think that the way you're going to get what you want,\nor cause the change that you want to change, to happen,\nis that you've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread."
p2172
aS"\nAnd it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop\nor you're an intellectual, or you're in business, or you're flying hot air balloons.\nI think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.\nThat what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.\nThat people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.\nAnd when I talk about it I usually pick business\nbecause they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation,\nand because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.\nBut I want you to forgive me when I use these examples\nbecause I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do."
p2173
aS'\nAt the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.\nTV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.\nI call it the "TV-industrial complex."\nThe way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads --\ninterrupt some people -- that gets you distribution.\nYou use the distribution you get to sell more products.\nYou take the profit from that to buy more ads.\nAnd it goes around and around and around,\nthe same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.\nAnd that model of, and we heard it yesterday,\nif we could only get onto the homepage of Google,\nif we could only figure out how to get promoted there,\nif we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat,\nand tell them about what we want to do.\nIf we do that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.\nWell, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.\nI mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out\nhow to touch people in a way they weren\'t expecting,\nin a way they didn\'t necessarily want, with an ad,\nover and over and over again until they bought it.'
p2174
aS"\nAnd the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.\nThat just over the last few years,\nwhat anybody who markets anything has discovered\nis that it's not working the way that it used to.\nThis picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.\nBut the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.\nRight. I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.\nThe brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars\ntrying to interrupt me in one year.\n100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam\nand coupons and shelving allowances and spiff --\nall so I could ignore every single message.\nAnd I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem.\nI buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.\nAnd I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem,\nbecause I don't care."
p2175
aS'\nHere\'s a magazine called "Hydrate." It\'s 180 pages about water.'
p2176
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2177
aS'\nRight. Articles about water, ads about water.\nImagine what the world was like 40 years ago\nwhen it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.\nNow there are magazines about water.\nNew products from Coke Japan -- water salad.'
p2178
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2179
aS"\nOK. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks,\nbecause they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.\nI couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago --\nI circled the important parts so you can see them here.\nThey've come out ... Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt\nwith the voice of Tom Arnold,\nhoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich."
p2180
aS'\n(Laughter)'

aS'\nNow, this is Copernicus, and he was right,\nwhen he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.\nThe world revolves around me. Me, me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.\nI don\'t want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail."'

aS"\nSo consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway;\nI mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something,\nor people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article.\nConsumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.\nPart of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to,\nand way less time.\nAnd in a world where we have too many choices\nand too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.\nAnd my parable here is you're driving down the road\nand you see a cow, and you keep driving\nbecause you've seen cows before.\nCows are invisible. Cows are boring.\nWho's going to stop and pull over and say -- oh, look, a cow. Nobody."

p2187
aS'\nBut if the cow was purple -- isn\'t that a great special effect?\nI could do that again if you want it.\nIf the cow was purple, you\'d notice it for a while.\nI mean, if all cows were purple you\'d get bored with those, too.\nThe thing that\'s going to decide what gets talked about,\nwhat gets done, what gets changed,\nwhat gets purchased, what gets built,\nis: is it remarkable?\nAnd "remarkable" is a really cool word because we think it just means neat,\nbut it also means -- worth making a remark about.\nAnd that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.\nThat two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car,\nbig enough to hold a mini in its trunk.\nPeople are paying full price for both, and the only thing they have in common\nis that they don\'t have anything in common.'

aS'\nEvery week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.\nIt\'s never "The Godfather;" it\'s never "Citizen Kane;"\nit\'s always some third rate movie with some second rate star.\nBut the reason it\'s number one is because that\'s the week it came out.\nBecause it\'s new, because it\'s fresh.\nBecause people saw it and said -- I didn\'t know that was there --\nand they noticed it.\nTwo of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail --\none sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box,\nand one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.\nThe only thing they have in common is that they\'re different.'

aS'\nWe\'re now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living,\nwe\'re in the fashion business.\nAnd the thing is, people in the fashion business\nknow what it\'s like to be in the fashion business -- they\'re used to it.\nThe rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.\nHow to understand that it\'s not about interrupting people with big full-page ads,\nor insisting on meetings with people.\nBut it\'s a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread,\nand which ones don\'t.\nThis chair -- they sold a billion dollars\' worth of Aeron chairs\nby reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.\nThey turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought,\nto something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.\nThis guy, Lionel Poilane, the most famous baker in the world --\nhe died two and a half months ago,\nand he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.\nHe lived in Paris. Last year he sold 10 million dollars\' worth of French bread.\nEvery loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.\nAnd when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it.\nThey didn\'t want to buy his bread. It didn\'t look like "French bread."\nIt wasn\'t what they expected.\nIt was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly it spread from one person to another person\nuntil finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.\nNow he\'s in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.'
p2191
aS"\nWhat marketers used to do is make average products for average people.\nThat's what mass marketing is.\nSmooth out the edges; go for the center;\nthat's the big market.\nThey would ignore the geeks,\nand God forbid, the laggards.\nIt was all about going for the center.\nBut in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken,\nI don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.\nI think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people\nbecause they're really good at ignoring you.\nBut market to these people because they care.\nThese are the people who are obsessed with something.\nAnd when you talk to them they'll listen\nbecause they like listening -- it's about them.\nAnd if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends\non the rest of the curve, and it'll spread.\nIt'll spread to the entire curve."
p2192
aS'\nThey have something I call "otaku" -- it\'s a great Japanese word.\nIt describes the desire of someone who\'s obsessed to say,\ndrive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place,\nbecause that\'s what they do: they get obsessed with it.\nTo make a product, to market an idea,\nto come up with any problem you want to solve\nthat doesn\'t have a constituency with an otaku,\nis almost impossible.\nInstead, you have to find a group that really,\ndesperately cares about what it is you have to say.\nTalk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.\nThere\'s a hot sauce otaku, but there\'s no mustard otaku.\nThat\'s why there\'s lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces,\nand not so many kinds of mustard.\nNot because it\'s hard to make interesting mustard\n-- you can make interesting mustard --\nbut people don\'t because no one\'s obsessed with it,\nand thus no one tells their friends.\nKrispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.\nKrispy Kreme has a strategy, and what they do is,\nthey enter a city, they talk to the people with otaku,\nand then they spread through the city\nto the people who\'ve just crossed the street.'
p2193
aS"\nThis yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.\nNot everybody wants it but they don't care.\nThey want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.\nThese guys make the loudest car stereo in the world."

p2196
aS"\nIt's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening,\nand maybe, just maybe those people tell their friends.\nSo when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote, right,\nwho are all tuned in from 130 countries\nwatching his two-hour commercial --\nthat's the only thing keeping his company in business --\nis that those 50,000 people care desperately enough\nto watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.\nPearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.\nEvery one made a profit. How?\nThey only sell them on their website.\nThose people who buy them on the website have the otaku,\nand then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.\nThis hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.\nBut hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.\nHard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody,\nbut to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.\nThis paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company,\nmaking them a fortune.

p2203
aS"\nA couple of quick rules to wrap up.\nThe first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.\nAnd the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable\nmore often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.\nNumber two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.\nProctor and Gamble knows this, right?\nThe whole model of being Proctor and Gamble\nis always about average products for average people.\nThat's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes,\nbe remarkable.\nAnd being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.\nVery good is boring. Very good is average.\nIt doesn't matter whether you're making a record album,\nor you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.\nIf it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it."

You don't have to like it,\nbut a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes\nin the middle of New York City is remarkable.\nFrank Gehry didn't just change a museum;\nhe changed an entire city's economy\nby designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.\nNow, at countless meetings at, you know,\nthe Portland City Council, or who knows where,\nthey said, we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry?\nBecause he did something that was at the fringes.\nAnd my big failure?

aS'\nI have had classes that were so low,\nso academically deficient that I cried.\nI wondered, how am I going to take this group\nin nine months\nfrom where they are to where they need to be?\nAnd it was difficult. It was awfully hard.\nHow do I raise the self-esteem of a child\nand his academic achievement at the same time?'
p2225
aS'\nOne year I came up with a bright idea.\nI told all my students,\n"You were chosen to be in my class\nbecause I am the best teacher\nand you are the best students,\nthey put us all together\nso we could show everybody else how to do it."'
p2226
aS'\nOne of the students said, "Really?"\n(Laughter)'
p2227
aS'\nI said, "Really. We have to show the other classes\nhow to do it, so when we walk down the hall,\npeople will notice us, so you can\'t make noise.\nYou just have to strut."\nAnd I gave them a saying to say: "I am somebody.\nI was somebody when I came.\nI\'ll be a better somebody when I leave.\nI am powerful, and I am strong.\nI deserve the education that I get here.\nI have things to do, people to impress,\nand places to go."'
p2228
aS'\nAnd they said, "Yeah!"'
p2229
aS'\nYou say it long enough,\nit starts to be a part of you.'
p2230
aS'\nAnd so  (Applause)\nI gave a quiz, 20 questions.\nA student missed 18.\nI put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.'
p2231
aS'\nHe said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"'
p2232
aS'\nI said, "Yes."'
p2233
aS'\nHe said, "Then why\'d you put a smiley face?"'
p2234
aS'\nI said, "Because you\'re on a roll.\nYou got two right. You didn\'t miss them all."\nI said, "And when we review this,\nwon\'t you do better?"'
p2235
aS'\nHe said, "Yes, ma\'am, I can do better."'
p2236
aS'\nYou see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.\n"+2" said, "I ain\'t all bad."\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p2237
aS'\nFor years I watched my mother\ntake the time at recess to review,\ngo on home visits in the afternoon,\nbuy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers\nto put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat,\nand a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn\'t smell so good.\nSee, it\'s hard to teach kids who stink.\nAnd kids can be cruel.\nAnd so she kept those things in her desk,\nand years later, after she retired,\nI watched some of those same kids come through\nand say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,\nyou made a difference in my life.\nYou made it work for me.\nYou made me feel like I was somebody,\nwhen I knew, at the bottom, I wasn\'t.\nAnd I want you to just see what I\'ve become."'
p2238
aS'\nAnd when my mama died two years ago at 92,\nthere were so many former students at her funeral,\nit brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone,\nbut because she left a legacy of relationships\nthat could never disappear.'
p2239
aS"\nCan we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely.\nWill you like all your children? Of course not.\nAnd you know your toughest kids are never absent.\n(Laughter)\nNever. You won't like them all,\nand the tough ones show up for a reason.\nIt's the connection. It's the relationships.\nAnd while you won't like them all,\nthe key is, they can never, ever know it.\nSo teachers become great actors and great actresses,\nand we come to work when we don't feel like it,\nand we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense,\nand we teach anyway.\nWe teach anyway, because that's what we do."
p2240
aS'\nTeaching and learning should bring joy.\nHow powerful would our world be\nif we had kids who were not afraid to take risks,\nwho were not afraid to think,\nand who had a champion?\nEvery child deserves a champion,\nan adult who will never give up on them,\nwho understands the power of connection,\nand insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.'
p2241
aS"\nIs this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha.\nBut it is not impossible.\nWe can do this. We're educators.\nWe're born to make a difference."

S'\nWhen I was little,\nI thought my country was the best on the planet,\nand I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy."\nAnd I was very proud.\nIn school, we spent a lot of time\nstudying the history of Kim Il-Sung,\nbut we never learned much about the outside world,\nexcept that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.\nAlthough I often wondered about the outside world,\nI thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,\nuntil everything suddenly changed.'
p2246
aS'\nWhen I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution,\nbut I thought my life in North Korea was normal.\nMy family was not poor,\nand myself, I had never experienced hunger.'
p2247
aS'\nBut one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter\nfrom a coworker\'s sister.\nIt read, "When you read this, all five family members\nwill not exist in this world,\nbecause we haven\'t eaten for the past two weeks.\nWe are lying on the floor together,\nand our bodies are so weak we are ready to die."'
p2248
aS"\nI was so shocked.\nThis was the first time I heard\nthat people in my country were suffering.\nSoon after, when I was walking past a train station,\nI saw something terrible\nthat I can't erase from my memory.\nA lifeless woman was lying on the ground,\nwhile an emaciated child in her arms\njust stared helplessly at his mother's face.\nBut nobody helped them, because they were so focused\non taking care of themselves and their families."
p2249
aS"\nA huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.\nUltimately, more than a million North Koreans\ndied during the famine, and many only survived\nby eating grass, bugs and tree bark.\nPower outages also became more and more frequent,\nso everything around me was completely dark at night\nexcept for the sea of lights in China,\njust across the river from my home.\nI always wondered why they had lights but we didn't.\nThis is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night\ncompared to neighbors."
p2250
aS"\nThis is the Amrok River,\nwhich serves as a part of the border\nbetween North Korea and China.\nAs you can see, the river can be very narrow\nat certain points, allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.\nBut many die.\nSometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.\nI can't reveal many details [about] how I left North Korea,\nbut I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine\nI was sent to China to live with distant relatives.\nBut I only thought\nthat I would be separated from my family for a short time.\nI could have never imagined\nthat it would take 14 years to live together."
p2251
aS"\nIn China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.\nI had no idea what life was going to be like\nas a North Korean refugee,\nbut I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,\nit's also very dangerous,\nsince North Korean refugees are considered in China\nas illegal migrants.\nSo I was living in constant fear\nthat my identity could be revealed,\nand I would be repatriated to a horrible fate\nback in North Korea."
p2252
aS'\nOne day, my worst nightmare came true,\nwhen I was caught by the Chinese police\nand brought to the police station for interrogation.\nSomeone had accused me of being North Korean,\nso they tested my Chinese language abilities\nand asked me tons of questions.\nI was so scared,\nI thought my heart was going to explode.\nIf anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned\nand repatriated.\nI thought my life was over,\nbut I managed to control all the emotions inside me\nand answer the questions.\nAfter they finished questioning me,\none official said to another,\n"This was a false report.\nShe\'s not North Korean."\nAnd they let me go. It was a miracle.'
p2253
aS'\nSome North Koreans in China seek asylum\nin foreign embassies,\nbut many can be caught by the Chinese police\nand repatriated.\nThese girls were so lucky.\nEven though they were caught,\nthey were eventually released\nafter heavy international pressure.\nThese North Koreans were not so lucky.\nEvery year, countless North Koreans are caught in China\nand repatriated to North Korea,\nwhere they can be tortured, imprisoned\nor publicly executed.'
p2254
aS"\nEven though I was really fortunate to get out,\nmany other North Koreans have not been so lucky.\nIt's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities\nand struggle so hard just to survive.\nEven after learning a new language and getting a job,\ntheir whole world can be turned upside down in an instant.\nThat's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,\nI decided to risk going to South Korea,\nand I started a new life yet again."
p2255
aS'\nSettling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging\nthan I had expected.\nEnglish was so important in South Korea,\nso I had to start learning my third language.\nAlso, I realized there was a wide gap\nbetween North and South.\nWe are all Korean, but inside,\nwe have become very different\ndue to 67 years of division.\nI even went through an identity crisis.\nAm I South Korean or North Korean?\nWhere am I from? Who am I?\nSuddenly, there was no country\nI could proudly call my own.'
p2256
aS'\nEven though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,\nI made a plan.\nI started studying for the university entrance exam.'
p2257
aS'\nJust as I was starting to get used to my new life,\nI received a shocking phone call.\nThe North Korean authorities\nintercepted some money that I sent to my family,\nand, as a punishment, my family was going\nto be forcibly removed\nto a desolate location in the countryside.\nThey had to get out quickly,\nso I started planning how to help them escape.'
p2258
aS"\nNorth Koreans have to travel incredible distances\non the path to freedom.\nIt's almost impossible to cross the border\nbetween North Korea and South Korea,\nso, ironically, I took a flight back to China\nand I headed toward the North Korean border.\nSince my family couldn't speak Chinese,\nI had to guide them,\nsomehow, through more than 2,000 miles in China\nand then into Southeast Asia.\nThe journey by bus took one week,\nand we were almost caught several times.\nOne time, our bus was stopped\nand boarded by a Chinese police officer.\nHe took everyone's I.D. cards,\nand he started asking them questions.\nSince my family couldn't understand Chinese,\nI thought my family was going to be arrested.\nAs the Chinese officer approached my family,\nI impulsively stood up, and I told him\nthat these are deaf and dumb people\nthat I was chaperoning.\nHe looked at me suspiciously,\nbut luckily he believed me."
p2259
aS'\nWe made it all the way to the border of Laos,\nbut I had to spend almost all my money\nto bribe the border guards in Laos.\nBut even after we got past the border,\nmy family was arrested and jailed\nfor illegal border crossing.\nAfter I paid the fine and bribe,\nmy family was released in one month,\nbut soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again\nin the capital of Laos.'
p2260
aS"\nThis was one of the lowest points in my life.\nI did everything to get my family to freedom,\nand we came so close,\nbut my family was thrown in jail\njust a short distance from the South Korean embassy.\nI went back and forth between the immigration office\nand the police station,\ndesperately trying to get my family out,\nbut I didn't have enough money\nto pay a bribe or fine anymore.\nI lost all hope."
p2261
aS'\nAt that moment, I heard one man\'s voice ask me,\n"What\'s wrong?"'
p2262
aS'\nI was so surprised\nthat a total stranger cared enough to ask.\nIn my broken English, and with a dictionary,\nI explained the situation, and without hesitating,\nthe man went to the ATM\nand he paid the rest of the money for my family\nand two other North Koreans to get out of jail.'
p2263
aS'\nI thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,\n"Why are you helping me?"'
p2264
aS'\n"I\'m not helping you," he said.\n"I\'m helping the North Korean people."'
p2265
aS'\nI realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.\nThe kind stranger symbolized new hope for me\nand the North Korean people when we needed it most,\nand he showed me the kindness of strangers\nand the support of the international community\nare truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.'
p2266
aS'\nEventually, after our long journey,\nmy family and I were reunited in South Korea,\nbut getting to freedom is only half the battle.\nMany North Koreans are separated from their families,\nand when they arrive in a new country,\nthey start with little or no money.\nSo we can benefit from the international community\nfor education, English language training,\njob training, and more.\nWe can also act as a bridge\nbetween the people inside North Korea\nand the outside world,\nbecause many of us stay in contact\nwith family members still inside,\nand we send information and money\nthat is helping to change North Korea from inside.'
p2267
aS"\nI've been so lucky, received so much help\nand inspiration in my life,\nso I want to help give aspiring North Koreans\na chance to prosper\nwith international support.\nI'm confident that you will see more and more\nNorth Koreans succeeding all over the world,\nincluding the TED stage."

aa(lp2271
S"\nNow, I want to start with a question:\nWhen was the last time you were called childish?\nFor kids like me,\nbeing called childish can be a frequent occurrence.\nEvery time we make irrational demands,\nexhibit irresponsible behavior\nor display any other signs\nof being normal American citizens,\nwe are called childish.\nWhich really bothers me.\nAfter all, take a look at these events:\nImperialism and colonization,\nworld wars, George W. Bush.\nAsk yourself, who's responsible? Adults."
p2272
aS'\nNow, what have kids done?\nWell, Anne Frank touched millions\nwith her powerful account of the Holocaust,\nRuby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States,\nand, most recently,\nCharlie Simpson helped to raise\n120,000 pounds for Haiti\non his little bike.\nSo, as you can see evidenced by such examples,\nage has absolutely nothing to do with it.\nThe traits the word childish addresses\nare seen so often in adults\nthat we should abolish this age-discriminatory word\nwhen it comes to criticizing behavior\nassociated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.'
p2273
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2274
aS'\nThank you.'
p2275
aS'\nThen again, who\'s to say\nthat certain types of irrational thinking\naren\'t exactly what the world needs?\nMaybe you\'ve had grand plans before\nbut stopped yourself, thinking,\n"That\'s impossible," or, "That costs too much,"\nor, "That won\'t benefit me."\nFor better or worse, we kids aren\'t hampered as much\nwhen it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.\nKids can be full of inspiring aspirations\nand hopeful thinking.\nLike my wish that no one went hungry\nor that everything were a free kind of utopia.\nHow many of you still dream like that\nand believe in the possibilities?\nSometimes a knowledge of history\nand the past failures of utopian ideals\ncan be a burden\nbecause you know that if everything were free,\nthen the food stocks would become depleted\nand scarce and lead to chaos.\nOn the other hand,\nwe kids still dream about perfection.\nAnd that\'s a good thing because in order\nto make anything a reality,\nyou have to dream about it first.'
p2276
aS"\nIn many ways, our audacity to imagine\nhelps push the boundaries of possibility.\nFor instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,\nmy home state -- yoohoo Washington!\n(Applause) --\nhas a program called Kids Design Glass,\nand kids draw their own ideas for glass art.\nNow, the resident artist said they got\nsome of their best ideas through the program\nbecause kids don't think about the limitations\nof how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes;\nthey just think of good ideas.\nNow, when you think of glass, you might\nthink of colorful Chihuly designs\nor maybe Italian vases,\nbut kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that\ninto the realm of broken-hearted snakes\nand bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.\n(Laughter)"
p2277
aS'\nNow, our inherent wisdom\ndoesn\'t have to be insider\'s knowledge.\nKids already do a lot of learning from adults,\nand we have a lot to share.\nI think that adults should start learning from kids.\nNow, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd,\nteachers and students, and I like this analogy:\nIt shouldn\'t just be a teacher at the head of the classroom\ntelling students, "Do this, do that."\nThe students should teach their teachers.\nLearning between grown ups and kids\nshould be reciprocal.\nThe reality, unfortunately, is a little different,\nand it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.'
p2278
aS'\nNow, if you don\'t trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?\nIf I doubt my older sister\'s ability\nto pay back the 10 percent interest\nI established on her last loan,\nI\'m going to withhold her ability to get more money from me\nuntil she pays it back. (Laughter)\nTrue story, by the way.\nNow, adults seem to have\na prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids\nfrom every "don\'t do that,\ndon\'t do this" in the school handbook\nto restrictions on school Internet use.\nAs history points out, regimes become oppressive\nwhen they\'re fearful about keeping control.\nAnd although adults may not be quite at the level\nof totalitarian regimes,\nkids have no, or very little say in making the rules,\nwhen really the attitude should be reciprocal,\nmeaning that the adult population should learn\nand take into account the wishes\nof the younger population.'
p2279
aS'\nNow, what\'s even worse than restriction\nis that adults often underestimate kids abilities.\nWe love challenges, but when expectations are low,\ntrust me, we will sink to them.\nMy own parents had anything but low expectations\nfor me and my sister.\nOkay, so they didn\'t tell us to become doctors\nor lawyers or anything like that,\nbut my dad did read to us\nabout Aristotle\nand pioneer germ fighters\nwhen lots of other kids were hearing\n"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."\nWell, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.\n(Laughter)'
p2280
aS'\nI loved to write from the age of four,\nand when I was six\nmy mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word.\nThank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.\nI wrote over 300 short stories\non that little laptop,\nand I wanted to get published.\nInstead of just scoffing at this heresy\nthat a kid wanted to get published\nor saying wait until you\'re older,\nmy parents were really supportive.\nMany publishers were not quite so encouraging,\none large children\'s publisher ironically saying\nthat they didn\'t work with children --\nchildren\'s publisher not working with children?\nI don\'t know, you\'re kind of alienating a large client there.\n(Laughter)\nNow, one publisher, Action Publishing,\nwas willing to take that leap and trust me\nand to listen to what I had to say.\nThey published my first book, "Flying Fingers," -- you see it here --\nand from there on, it\'s gone to speaking at hundreds of schools,\nkeynoting to thousands of educators\nand finally, today, speaking to you.'
p2281
aS"\nI appreciate your attention today,\nbecause to show that you truly care,\nyou listen.\nBut there's a problem with this rosy picture\nof kids being so much better than adults.\nKids grow up and become adults just like you.\n(Laughter)\nOr just like you? Really?\nThe goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult,\nbut rather better adults than you have been,\nwhich may be a little challenging\nconsidering your guys' credentials (Laughter).\nBut the way progress happens\nis because new generations and new eras\ngrow and develop and become better than the previous ones.\nIt's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.\nNo matter your position or place in life,\nit is imperative to create opportunities for children\nso that we can grow up to blow you away.\n(Laughter)"
p2282
aS"\nAdults and fellow TEDsters,\nyou need to listen and learn from kids\nand trust us and expect more from us.\nYou must lend an ear today,\nbecause we are the leaders of tomorrow,\nwhich means we're going to be taking care of you\nwhen you're old and senile. No, just kidding.\nNo, really, we are going to be the next generation,\nthe ones who will bring this world forward.\nAnd in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you,\nremember that cloning is possible,\nand that involves going through childhood again,\nin which case you'll want to be heard\njust like my generation.\nNow, the world needs opportunities\nfor new leaders and new ideas.\nKids need opportunities to lead and succeed.\nAre you ready to make the match?\nBecause the world's problems\nshouldn't be the human family's heirloom."

S"\nI'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.\nI've been making games online now for 10 years,\nand my goal for the next decade\nis to try to make it as easy\nto save the world in real life\nas it is to save the world in online games.\nNow, I have a plan for this,\nand it entails convincing more people,\nincluding all of you, to spend more time\nplaying bigger and better games."
p2286
aS'\nRight now we spend three billion hours a week\nplaying online games.\nSome of you might be thinking,\n"That\'s a lot of time to spend playing games.\nMaybe too much time, considering\nhow many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."\nBut actually, according to my research\nat The Institute For The Future,\nit\'s actually the opposite is true.\nThree billion hours a week is not nearly enough\ngame play to solve the world\'s most urgent problems.'
p2287
aS"\nIn fact, I believe that if we want to survive\nthe next century on this planet,\nwe need to increase that total dramatically.\nI've calculated the total we need\nat 21 billion hours of game play every week.\nSo, that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea,\nso I'll say it again, let it sink in:\nIf we want to solve problems like hunger,\npoverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,\nI believe that we need to aspire\nto play games online\nfor at least 21 billion hours a week,\nby the end of the next decade. (Laughter)\nNo. I'm serious. I am."
p2288
aS"\nHere's why. This picture pretty much\nsums up why I think games are so essential\nto the future survival of the human species. (Laughter) Truly.\nThis is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano.\nHe wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,\nso he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.\nAnd this is a classic gaming emotion.\nNow, if you're not a gamer,\nyou might miss some of the nuance in this photo.\nYou probably see the sense of urgency,\na little bit of fear, but intense concentration,\ndeep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem."
p2289
aS"\nIf you are a gamer, you will notice\na few nuances here: the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth\nis a sign of optimism,\nand the eyebrows up is surprise.\nThis is a gamer who is on the verge of something called\nan epic win.\n(Laughter)\nOh, you've heard of that. OK, good,\nso we have some gamers among us.\nAn epic win is an outcome\nthat is so extraordinarily positive\nyou had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.\nIt was almost beyond the threshold of imagination.\nAnd when you get there you are shocked\nto discover what you are truly capable of. That is an epic win.\nThis is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.\nAnd this is the face that we need to see\non millions of problem-solvers all over the world\nas we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century --\nthe face of someone who, against all odds\nis on the verge of an epic win."
p2290
aS'\nNow, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see\nin everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.\nThis is what I call the "I\'m Not Good At Life" face,\nand this is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good.\nThis is actually me making the "I\'m Not Good At Life" face.\nThis is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood\nin Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD\non why we\'re better in games than we are in real life.\nAnd this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.\nWe feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.'
p2291
aS"\nAnd I don't mean just good as in successful,\nalthough that's part of it.\nWe do achieve more in game worlds. But I also\nmean good as in\nmotivated to do something that matters,\ninspired to collaborate and to cooperate.\nAnd when we're in game worlds\nI believe that many of us become\nthe best version of ourselves, the most likely to help at a moment's notice,\nthe most likely to stick with a problem\nas long at it takes, to get up after failure and try again.\nAnd in real life, when we face failure,\nwhen we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.\nWe feel overcome,\nwe feel overwhelmed,\nwe feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.\nWe never have those feelings when we're playing games,\nthey just don't exist in games.\nSo, that's what I wanted to study\nwhen I was a graduate student."
p2292
aS"\nWhat about games makes it impossible\nto feel that we can't achieve everything?\nHow can we take those feelings from games\nand apply them to real-world work?\nSo, I looked at games like World of Warcraft,\nwhich is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.\nAnd I started to notice a few things\nthat make epic wins so possible in online worlds."
p2293
aS"\nSo, the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,\nespecially in World of Warcraft,\nthere are lots and lots of different characters\nwho are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.\nBut not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched\nwith your current level in the game. Right?\nSo, you can do it.\nThey never give you a challenge that you can't achieve.\nBut it is on the verge of what you're capable of. So, you have to try hard,\nbut there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft.\nThere is no sitting around wringing your hands,\nthere's always something specific and important to be done.\nAnd there are also tons of collaborators.\nEverywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people\nready to work with you\nto achieve your epic mission."
p2294
aS"\nThat's not something that we have in real life that easily,\nthis sense that at our fingertips\nare tons of collaborators.\nAnd also there is this epic story, this inspiring story\nof why we're there, and what we're doing.\nAnd then we get all this positive feedback.\nYou guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength,\nand plus-one intelligence.\nWe don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.\nWhen I get off this stage I'm not going to have\nplus-one speaking, and plus-one crazy idea,\nplus-20 crazy idea.\nI don't get that feedback in real life."
p2295
aS"\nNow, the problem with collaborative online environments\nlike World of Warcraft\nis that it's so satisfying\nto be on the verge of an epic win all the time\nthat we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.\nIt's just better than reality.\nSo, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers\nhave spent 5.93 million years\nsolving the virtual problems of Azeroth.\nNow, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\nIt might sound like it's a bad thing.\nBut to put that in context:\n5.93 million years ago\nwas when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.\nThat was the first upright primate."
p2296
aS"\nOkay, so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing\nin playing games, the only way it makes sense\nto even think about it is to talk about time\nat the magnitude of human evolution,\nwhich is an extraordinary thing.\nBut it's also apt. Because it turns out\nthat by spending all this time playing games,\nwe're actually changing what we\nare capable of as human beings.\nWe are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.\nThis is true. I believe this."
p2297
aS'\nSo, consider this really interesting statistic;\nit was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:\nThe average young person today\nin a country with a strong gamer culture\nwill have spent 10,000 hours playing online games\nby the age of 21.\nNow 10,000 hours is a really\ninteresting number for two reasons.\nFirst of all, for children in the United States\n10,080 hours is the exact amount of time\nyou will spend in school\nfrom fifth grade to high school graduation\nif you have perfect attendance.'
p2298
aS'\nSo, we have an entire\nparallel track of education going on\nwhere young people are learning as much about\nwhat it takes to be a good gamer\nas they are learning about everything else in school.\nAnd some of you have probably read\nMalcolm Gladwell\'s new book "Outliers."\nSo, you would have heard of his theory of success,\nthe 10,000 hour theory of success.\nIt\'s based on this great cognitive science research\nthat if we can master 10,000 hours\nof effortful study at anything\nby the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it.\nWe will be as good at whatever we do\nas the greatest people in the world.\nAnd so, now what we\'re looking at\nis an entire generation of young people\nwho are virtuoso gamers.'

aS'\nSo, the big question is,\n"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?"\nBecause if we could figure that out,\nwe would have a virtually unprecedented\nhuman resource on our hands.\nThis is how many people we now have in the world\nwho spend at least an hour a day playing online games.\nThese are our virtuoso gamers,\n500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.\nAnd in the next decade\nwe\'re going to have another billion gamers\nwho are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.\nIf you don\'t know it already, this is coming.\nThe game industry is developing consoles\nthat are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks\ninstead of broadband Internet\nso that gamers all over the world,\nparticularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.\nThey expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.\nIt will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.'
p2300
aS"\nSo, I've started to think about what these games\nare making us virtuosos at.\nHere are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism.\nOK, think of this as extreme self-motivation.\nUrgent optimism is the desire to act immediately\nto tackle an obstacle,\ncombined with the belief\nthat we have a reasonable hope of success.\nGamers always believe that an epic win is possible,\nand that it is always worth trying, and trying now.\nGamers don't sit around.\nGamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.\nThere's a lot of interesting research that shows\nthat we like people better after we play a game with them,\neven if they've beaten us badly.\nAnd the reason is, it takes a lot of trust\nto play a game with someone.\nWe trust that they will spend their time with us,\nthat they will play by the same rules,\nvalue the same goal, they'll stay with the game until it's over."
p2301
aS"\nAnd so, playing a game together actually builds up\nbonds and trust and cooperation.\nAnd we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.\nBlissful productivity. I love it.\nYou know there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer\nplays for 22 hours a week,\nkind of a half-time job.\nIt's because we know, when we're playing a game,\nthat we're actually happier\nworking hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out.\nWe know that we are optimized, as human beings,\nto do hard meaningful work.\nAnd gamers are willing to work hard\nall the time, if they're given the right work."
p2302
aS'\nFinally: epic meaning.\nGamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions\nto human planetary-scale stories.\nSo, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:\nSo, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.\nSecond biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,\nis the World of Warcraft wiki.\nFive million people use it every month.\nThey have compiled more information about World of Warcraft\non the Internet than any other\ntopic covered on any other wiki in the world.\nThey are building an epic story.\nThey are building an epic knowledge resource\nabout the World of Warcraft.'
p2303
aS"\nOkay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:\nGamers are super-empowered, hopeful individuals.\nThese are people who believe that they are individually capable\nof changing the world.\nAnd the only problem is that they believe\nthat they are capable of changing virtual worlds\nand not the real world.\nThat's the problem that I'm trying to solve."
p2304
aS'\nThere\'s an economist named Edward Castronova.\nHis work is brilliant. He looks at why\npeople are investing so much time and energy\nand money in online worlds.\nAnd he says, "We\'re witnessing what amounts\nto no less than a mass exodus\nto virtual worlds and online game environments."\nAnd he\'s an economist. So, he\'s rational.\nAnd he says ... (Laughter)\nNot like me -- I\'m a game designer; I\'m exuberant.\nBut he says\nthat this makes perfect sense,\nbecause gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life.\nThey can have stronger social relationships\nin games than they can have in real life;\nthey get better feedback and feel more rewarded\nin games than they do in real life.\nSo, he says for now it makes perfect sense\nfor gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.\nNow, I also agree that that is rational, for now.\nBut it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.\nWe have to start making the real world more like a game.'
p2305
aS"\nSo, I take my inspiration from something that happened\n2,500 years ago.\nThese are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. Right?\nBefore we had awesome game controllers,\nwe had sheep's knuckles.\nAnd these represent the first game equipment\ndesigned by human beings.\nAnd if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian\nHerodotus, you might know this history,\nwhich is the history of\nwho invented games and why.\nHerodotus says that games, particularly dice games,\nwere invented in the kingdom of Lydia\nduring a time of famine."
p2306
aS'\nApparently, there was such a severe famine\nthat the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy.\nPeople were suffering. People were fighting.\nIt was an extreme situation, they needed\nan extreme solution.\nSo, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games\nand they set up a kingdom-wide policy:\nOn one day, everybody would eat,\nand on the next day, everybody would play games.\nAnd they would be so immersed in playing the dice games\nbecause games are so engaging,\nand immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity,\nthey would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.\nAnd then on the next day, they would play games;\nand on the next day, they would eat.'
p2307
aS"\nAnd according to Herodotus,\nthey passed 18 years this way,\nsurviving through a famine\nby eating on one day and playing games on the next.\nNow, this is exactly, I think,\nhow we're using games today.\nWe're using games to escape real-world suffering.\nWe're using games to get away from everything that's broken\nin the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life,\nand we're getting what we need from games."
p2308
aS"\nBut it doesn't have to end there.\nThis is really exciting.\nAccording to Herodotus, after 18 years\nthe famine wasn't getting better,\nso the king decided they would play one final dice game.\nThey divided the entire kingdom in half.\nThey played one dice game,\nand the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.\nThey would leave Lydia,\nand they would go out in search of a new place to live,\nleaving behind just enough people\nto survive on the resources that were available,\nand hopefully to take their civilization\nsomewhere else where they could thrive."
p2309
aS"\nNow, this sounds crazy, right?\nBut recently, DNA evidence\nhas shown that the Etruscans,\nwho then led to the Roman Empire,\nactually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.\nAnd so, recently, scientists have suggested\nthat Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.\nAnd geologists have found evidence\nof a global cooling that lasted\nfor nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine.\nSo, this crazy story might be true.\nThey might have actually\nsaved their culture by playing games,\nescaping to games for 18 years,\nand then been so inspired,\nand knew so much about how to come together with games,\nthat they actually saved the entire civilization that way."
p2310
aS"\nOkay, we can do that.\nWe've been playing Warcraft since 1994.\nThat was the first real-time strategy game\nfrom the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago.\nThey played dice games for 18 years,\nwe've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.\nI say we are ready for our own epic game.\nNow, they had half the civilization\ngo off in search of a new world,\nso that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.\nLet's get half of us to agree\nto spend an hour a day playing games,\nuntil we solve real-world problems."
p2311
aS'\nNow, I know you\'re asking, "How are we going to solve real world problems\nin games?" Well, that\'s what I have devoted my work to\nover the past few years,\nat The Institute For The Future.\nWe have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,\nand it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.\nWe do not want to try to predict the future.\nWhat we want to do is make the future.\nWe want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,\nand then we want to empower people\nto make that outcome a reality.\nWe want to imagine epic wins,\nand then give people the means to achieve the epic win.'
p2312
aS"\nI'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made\nthat are an attempt to give people the means\nto create epic wins in their own futures.\nSo, this is World Without Oil.\nWe made this game in 2007.\nThis is an online game in which you try to survive\nan oil shortage.\nThe oil shortage is fictional,\nbut we put enough online content out there\nfor you to believe that it's real, and to live your real life\nas if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game,\nyou sign up, you tell us where you live,\nand then we give you real-time news, videos,\ndata feeds that show you\nexactly how much oil costs,\nwhat's not available, how food supply is being affected,\nhow transportation is being affected,\nif schools are closed, if there is rioting,\nand you have to figure out how you would live your real life\nas if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it,\nto post videos, to post photos."
p2313
aS'\nWe piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,\nand we\'ve tracked them for the three years since.\nAnd I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.\nNobody wants to change how they live\njust because it\'s good for the world, or because we\'re supposed to.\nBut if you immerse them in an epic adventure\nand tell them, "We\'ve run out of oil.\nThis is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.\nChallenge yourself to see how you would survive,"\nmost of our players have kept up the habits\nthat they learned in this game.'
p2314
aS"\nSo, for the next world-saving game,\nwe decided to aim higher: bigger problem than just peak oil.\nWe did a game called Superstruct\nat The Institute For The Future.\nAnd the premise was a supercomputer has calculated\nthat humans have only 23 years left on the planet.\nThis supercomputer was called the Global Extinction\nAwareness System, of course.\nWe asked people to come online\nalmost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.\nYou know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team --\nyou've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,\nand they all have something to do to save the world.\n(Laughter)"
p2315
aS'\nBut in our game, instead of just having five people\non the dream team, we said, "Everybody\'s on the dream team,\nand it\'s your job to invent the future of energy,\nthe future of food, the future of health,\nthe future of security and the future of the social safety net."\nWe had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.\nThey came up with 500 insanely creative solutions\nthat you can go online, if you Google "Superstruct," and see.'
p2316
aS"\nSo, finally, the last game,\nwe're launching it March 3rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute.\nIf you complete the game you will be certified\nby the World Bank Institute,\nas a Social Innovator, class of 2010.\nWorking with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa,\nand we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.\nWe've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up\nin skills like local insight, knowledge networking,\nsustainability, vision and resourcefulness.\nI would like to invite all of you\nto please share this game with young people,\nanywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,\nwho might benefit from coming together\nto try to start to imagine their own\nsocial enterprises to save the world."
p2317
aS"\nSo, I'm going to wrap up now.\nI want to ask a question.\nWhat do you think happens next?\nWe've got all these amazing gamers,\nwe've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do,\nbut none of them have saved the real world yet.\nWell I hope that you will agree with me\nthat gamers are a human resource\nthat we can use to do real-world work,\nthat games are a powerful platform for change.\nWe have all these amazing superpowers:\nblissful productivity, the ability\nto weave a tight social fabric,\nthis feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning."
p2318
aS"\nI really hope that we can come together\nto play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century.\nAnd that's my hope, that you will join me\nin making and playing games like this.\nWhen I look forward to the next decade,\nI know two things for sure:\nthat we can make any future we can imagine,\nand we can play any games we want.\nSo, I say: Let the world-changing games begin.\nThank you.\n(Applause)"

S'\nThat splendid music, the coming-in music --\n"The Elephant March" from "Aida" -- is the music I\'ve chosen for my funeral --\n(Laughter)\n-- and you can see why. It\'s triumphal.\nI won\'t feel anything, but if I could,\nI would feel triumphal at having lived at all,\nand at having lived on this splendid planet,\nand having been given the opportunity to understand\nsomething about why I was here in the first place, before not being here.'
p2321
aS'\nCan you understand my quaint English accent?\nLike everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session.\nRobert Full and Frans Lanting and others --\nthe beauty of the things they showed.\nThe only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,\n"the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth."\nNow of course, we know that he didn\'t really mean that,\nbut in this country at the moment, you can\'t be too careful.\n(Laughter)'
p2322
aS"\nI'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design,\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\nIn professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.\nIn non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.\nBut in non-professional circles within America,\nit arouses so much hostility --\n(Laughter)\n-- that it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war.\nThe war is so worrying at present,\nwith court cases coming up in one state after another,\nthat I felt I had to say something about it."
p2323
aS'\nIf you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself,\nI\'m afraid you\'re going to have to look at my books,\nwhich you won\'t find in the bookstore outside.\n(Laughter)\nContemporary court cases\noften concern an allegedly new version of creationism,\ncalled "Intelligent Design," or ID.\nDon\'t be fooled. There\'s nothing new about ID.\nIt\'s just creationism under another name,\nrechristened -- I choose the word advisedly --\n(Laughter)\n-- for tactical, political reasons.'
p2324
aS"\nThe arguments of so-called ID theorists\nare the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again,\nsince Darwin down to the present day.\nThere is an effective evolution lobby\ncoordinating the fight on behalf of science,\nand I try to do all I can to help them,\nbut they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention\nthat we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists.\nThey see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why.\nCreationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case,\nfall back on the popular phobia against atheism.\nTeach your children evolution in biology class,\nand they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual pre-version.\n(Laughter)"
p2325
aS'\nIn fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down\nare firm in their support of evolution.\nThis book, "Finding Darwin\'s God," by Kenneth Miller,\nis one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design\nthat I know, and it\'s all the more effective\nbecause it\'s written by a devout Christian.\nPeople like Kenneth Miller could be called a "godsend" to the evolution lobby --\n(Laughter)\n-- because they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,\ntantamount to atheism.\nPeople like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.'
p2326
aS"\nBut here, I want to say something nice about creationists.\nIt's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.\n(Laughter)\nI think they're right about one thing.\nI think they're right that evolution\nis fundamentally hostile to religion."
p2327
aS"\nI've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope,\nare also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves.\nI believe a true understanding of Darwinism\nis deeply corrosive to religious faith.\nNow, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism,\nand I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do.\nIn an audience as sophisticated as this one,\nthat would be preaching to the choir."
p2328
aS"\nNo, what I want to urge upon you --\n(Laughter)\n-- instead what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nBut that's putting it too negatively.\nIf I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith,\nI would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science,\nand indeed science generally, but evolution in particular,\nto inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic."
p2329
aS'\nNow, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design\nis to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.\nStatistical improbability in the direction of good design --\n"complexity" is another word for this.\nThe standard creationist argument -- there is only one; they all reduce to this one --\ntakes off from a statistical improbability.\nLiving creatures are too complex to have come about by chance;\ntherefore, they must have had a designer.\nThis argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.\nAny designer capable of designing something really complex\nhas to be even more complex himself, and that\'s before we even start\non the other things he\'s expected to do,\nlike forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers --\nfavor our side in a war --\n(Laughter)\n-- disapprove of our sex lives and so on.\n(Laughter)'
p2330
aS"\nComplexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve,\nand you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex,\nthereby simply compounding the problem.\nDarwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant\nbecause it solves the problem of explaining complexity\nin terms of nothing but simplicity.\nEssentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp\nof gradual step-by-step increment.\nBut here, I only want to make the point\nthat the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion\nprecisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful,\nso economically powerful.\nIt has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge."
p2331
aS'\nThe God theory is not just a bad theory.\nIt turns out to be, in principle, incapable of doing the job required of it.'
p2332
aS"\nSo, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby,\nI want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do.\nMy approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby.\nMy approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole,\nand at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo\nagainst speaking ill of religion,\nand I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams,\na dear friend who, if he never came to TED,\ncertainly should have been invited."
p2333
aS'\n(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)'
p2334
aS'\nRichard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been.'
p2335
aS'\nHe begins this speech which was tape-recorded in Cambridge\nshortly before he died.\nHe begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses\nthat are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on.\nI quote, "Religion doesn\'t seem to work like that.\nIt has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call \'sacred\' or \'holy.\'\nWhat it means is: here is an idea or a notion\nthat you\'re not allowed to say anything bad about.\nYou\'re just not. Why not? Because you\'re not.\n(Laughter)\nWhy should it be that it\'s perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats,\nthis model of economics versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows,\nbut to have an opinion about how the universe began,\nabout who created the universe -- no, that\'s holy.\nSo, we\'re used to not challenging religious ideas\nand it\'s very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates\nwhen he does it." He meant me, not that one.'
p2336
aS'\n"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it,\nbecause you\'re not allowed to say these things, yet when you look at it rationally,\nthere is no reason why those ideas shouldn\'t be as open to debate\nas any other, except that we\'ve agreed somehow between us\nthat they shouldn\'t be." And that\'s the end of the quote from Douglas.'
p2337
aS'\nIn my view, not only is science corrosive to religion;\nreligion is corrosive to science.\nIt teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations\nand blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp.\nIt teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith\ninstead of always insisting on evidence.'
p2338
aS'\nThere\'s Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, "Last Chance to See."\nNow, there\'s a typical scientific journal, the Quarterly Review of Biology.\nAnd I\'m going to put together, as guest editor,\na special issue on the question, "Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"\nAnd the first paper is a standard scientific paper\npresenting evidence, "Iridium Layer at the K-T Boundary,\nPotassium-Argon Dated Crater in Yucatan,\nIndicate That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."\nPerfectly ordinary scientific paper.\nNow, the next one, "The President of The Royal Society\nHas Been Vouchsafed a Strong Inner Conviction" -- (Laughter) --\n"... That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."\n(Laughter)\n"It Has Been Privately Revealed to Professor Huxtane\nThat an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."\n(Laughter)\n"Professor Hordley Was Brought Up\nto Have Total and Unquestioning Faith" --\n(Laughter) --\n"... That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."\n"Professor Hawkins Has Promulgated an Official Dogma\nBinding on All Loyal Hawkinsians\nThat an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs."\n(Laughter)\nThat\'s inconceivable, of course.'
p2339
aS'\nBut suppose --\n(Applause)\n-- in 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.\nwhether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism\nof Americans who are atheists.\nMr. Bush\'s reply has become infamous.\n"No, I don\'t know that atheists should be considered citizens,\nnor should they be considered patriots.\nThis is one nation under God."'
p2340
aS'\nBush\'s bigotry was not an isolated mistake,\nblurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted.\nHe stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal.\nHe really meant it.\nMore to the point, he knew it posed no threat to his election, quite the contrary.\nDemocrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness\nif they want to get elected. Both parties invoke "one nation under God."\nWhat would Thomas Jefferson have said?\nIncidentally, I\'m not usually very proud of being British,\nbut you can\'t help making the comparison.\n(Applause)'
p2341
aS'\nIn practice, what is an atheist?\nAn atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh\nthe way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.\nAs has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods\nthat humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)'
p2342
aS"\nAnd however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief\nthat a person is entitled to hold without being vilified\nas an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen.\nNevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist\nis tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.\nAnd that all stems from the perception of atheists\nas some kind of weird, way-out minority."
p2343
aS"\nNatalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker,\nsaying how lonely she felt as an atheist.\nShe clearly feels in a beleaguered minority,\nbut actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically?\nThe latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.\nChristianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share\nof the population, with nearly 160 million.\nBut what would you think was the second largest group,\nconvincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,\nand Hindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together?\nThe second largest group, of nearly 30 million,\nis the one described as non-religious or secular."
p2344
aS"\nYou can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians\nare so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby.\nThe state of Israel seems to owe its very existence\nto the American Jewish vote, while at the same time\nconsigning the non-religious to political oblivion.\nThis secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized,\nis nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote.\nWhy does this far more substantial minority\nnot make a move to exercise its political muscle?"
p2345
aS'\nWell, so much for quantity. How about quality?\nIs there any correlation, positive or negative,\nbetween intelligence and tendency to be religious?\n(Laughter)'
p2346
aS'\nThe survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey,\ndidn\'t break down its data by socio-economic class or education,\nIQ or anything else.\nBut a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine\nprovides some straws in the wind.\nMensa, as you know, is an international organization\nfor people with very high IQ.\nAnd from a meta-analysis of the literature,\nBell concludes that, I quote, "Of 43 studies carried out since 1927\non the relationship between religious belief and one\'s intelligence or educational level,\nall but four found an inverse connection.\nThat is, the higher one\'s intelligence or educational level,\nthe less one is likely to be religious."\nWell, I haven\'t seen the original 42 studies and I can\'t comment on that meta-analysis\nbut I would like to see more studies done along those lines.\nAnd I know that there are, if I could put a little plug here,\nthere are people in this audience\neasily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question,\nand I put the suggestion up -- for what it\'s worth.'
p2347
aS"\nBut let me know show you some data\nthat have been properly published and analyzed\non one special group, namely, top scientists.\nIn 1998, Larson and Witham\npolled the cream of American scientists,\nthose who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences,\nand among this select group,\nbelief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.\nAbout 20 percent are agnostic, and the rest could fairly be called atheists.\nSimilar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality.\nAmong biological scientists, the figures are even lower:\n5.5 percent, only, believe in God. Physical scientists: it's 7.5 percent.\nI've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars\nin other fields, such history or philosophy,\nbut I'd be surprised if they were different."
p2348
aS"\nSo, we've reached a truly remarkable situation,\na grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia\nand the American electorate.\nA philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe,\nwhich is held by the vast majority of top American scientists\nand probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally,\nis so abhorrent to the American electorate\nthat no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public.\nIf I'm right, this means that high office\nin the greatest country in the world\nis barred to the very people best qualified to hold it -- the intelligentsia --\nunless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs.\nTo put it bluntly, American political opportunities\nare heavily loaded against those\nwho are simultaneously intelligent and honest.\n(Applause)"
p2349
aS"\nI'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming\nif I suggest that something needs to be done.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I've already hinted what that something is.\nFrom what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it.\nAgain, I fear it will cost money.\nWe need a consciousness-raising,\ncoming-out campaign for American atheists.\n(Laughter)\nThis could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals\na few years ago,\nalthough heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing\nof people against their will.\nIn most cases, people who out themselves\nwill help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists."
p2350
aS"\nOn the contrary,\nthey'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people\nthat could serve as decent role models for your children,\nthe kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product,\nthe kinds of people who are sitting in this room.\nThere should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback,\nsuch that the more names we have, the more we get.\nThere could be non-linearities, threshold effects.\nWhen a critical mass has been attained,\nthere's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment.\nAnd again, it will need money."
p2351
aS'\nI suspect that the word "atheist" itself\ncontains or remains a stumbling block\nfar out of proportion to what it actually means, and a stumbling block to people\nwho otherwise might be happy to out themselves.\nSo, what other words might be used to smooth the path,\noil the wheels, sugar the pill? Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --\nand not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley, who coined the term.'
p2352
aS'\nDarwin said, "I have never been an atheist\nin the same sense of denying the existence of a God.\nI think that generally an \'agnostic\'\nwould be the most correct description of my state of mind."'
p2353
aS'\nHe even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling.\nAveling was a militant atheist\nwho failed to persuade Darwin\nto accept the dedication of his book on atheism --\nincidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth\nthat Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin,\nwhich he didn\'t. It was actually Edward Aveling.\nWhat happened was that Aveling\'s mistress was Marx\'s daughter,\nand when both Darwin and Marx were dead,\nMarx\'s papers became muddled up with Aveling\'s papers\nand a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much\nbut I don\'t want you to dedicate your book to me,"\nwas mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx,\nand that gave rise to this whole myth, which you\'ve probably heard.\nIt\'s a sort of urban myth,\nthat Marx tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.'
p2354
aS'\nAnyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling,\n"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"\n"\'Agnostic,\'" retorted Aveling, "was simply \'atheist\' writ respectable,\nand \'atheist\' was simply \'agnostic\' writ aggressive."\nDarwin complained, "But why should you be so aggressive?"\nDarwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia,\nbut that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it."\nWhich is, of course, our old friend, the "don\'t rock the boat" argument.\nIt\'s not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse.\n(Laughter)'
p2355
aS'\nBut in any case, that was more than 100 years ago.\nYou think we might have grown up since then.\nNow, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,\nwho incidentally observed the Sabbath\nfor reasons of cultural solidarity,\ndescribes himself as a "tooth fairy agnostic."\nHe won\'t call himself an atheist\nbecause it\'s, in principle, impossible to prove a negative,\nbut agnostic on its own might suggest that God\'s existence\nwas therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.'
p2356
aS'\nSo, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy,\nbut it isn\'t very likely, is it? Like God.\nHence the phrase, "tooth fairy agnostic."\nBertrand Russell made the same point\nusing a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars.\nYou would strictly have to be agnostic\nabout whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars,\nbut that doesn\'t mean you treat the likelihood of its existence\nas on all fours with its non-existence.'
p2357
aS"\nThe list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about\ndoesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots. It's infinite.\nIf you want to believe one particular one of them --\nunicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh --\nthe onus is on you to say why.\nThe onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.\nWe, who are atheists, are also a-fairiests and a-teapotists.\n(Laughter)"
p2358
aS'\nBut we don\'t bother to say so,\nand this is why my friend uses "tooth fairy agnostic"\nas a label for what most people would call atheist.\nNonetheless, if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly,\nwe\'re going to have find something better\nto stick on our banner than "tooth fairy" or "teapot agnostic."'
p2359
aS'\nSo, how about "humanist"?\nThis has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations\nand journals and things already in place.\nMy problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism.\nOne of the things we\'ve learned from Darwin\nis that the human species is only one\namong millions of cousins, some close, some distant.'
p2360
aS'\nAnd there are other possibilities like "naturalist,"\nbut that also has problems of confusion,\nbecause Darwin would have thought naturalist --\n"naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" --\nand it is used sometimes --\nDarwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist,"\nwhich he was, of course, and I suppose there might be others\nwho would confuse it with nudism.\n(Laughter)\nSuch people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob\nwhich last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.\n(Laughter)'
p2361
aS'\nI think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist" is simply "non-theist."\nIt lacks the strong connotation that there\'s definitely no God,\nand it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics.\nIt\'s completely compatible with the God of the physicists.\nWhen atheists\nlike Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"\nthey use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand\nfor that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don\'t yet understand.\n"Non-theist" will do for all that, yet unlike "atheist,"\nit doesn\'t have the same phobic, hysterical responses.\nBut I think, actually, the alternative\nis to grasp the nettle of the word "atheism" itself,\nprecisely because it is a taboo word\ncarrying frissons of hysterical phobia.\nCritical mass may be harder to achieve with the word "atheist"\nthan with the word "non-theist,"\nor some other non-confrontational word.\nBut if we did achieve it with that dread word -- "atheist" itself --\nthe political impact would be even greater.'
p2362
aS'\nNow, I said that if I were religious, I\'d be very afraid of evolution. I\'d go further.\nI would fear science in general if properly understood.\nAnd this is because the scientific worldview\nis so much more exciting, more poetic,\nmore filled with sheer wonder than anything\nin the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination.\nAs Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it,\n"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science\nand concluded, \'This is better than we thought!\nThe universe is much bigger than our prophet said,\ngrander, more subtle, more elegant?\' Instead they say, \'No, no, no!\nMy god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.\'\nA religion, old or new,\nthat stressed the magnificence of the universe\nas revealed by modern science\nmight be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe\nhardly tapped by the conventional faiths."'
p2363
aS"\nNow, this is an elite audience,\nand I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious.\nMany of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion,\nbut I also suspect that a fair number of those\nsecretly despise religion as much as I do.\n(Laughter)\nIf you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be,\nbut if you are one of them, I'm asking you to stop being polite,\ncome out and say so, and if you happen to be rich,\ngive some thought to ways in which you might make a difference.\nThe religious lobby in this country\nis massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits --\nby foundations such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.\nWe need an anti-Templeton to step forward.\nIf my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books,\ninstead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself."

aa(lp2392
S"\nThis story starts: I was at a friend's house,\nand she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual,\nwhich is the manual of mental disorders.\nIt lists every known mental disorder.\nAnd it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.\nAnd then it got bigger and bigger and bigger,\nand now it's 886 pages long.\nAnd it lists currently 374 mental disorders."
p2393
aS'\nSo I was leafing through it,\nwondering if I had any mental disorders,\nand it turns out I\'ve got 12.\n(Laughter)\nI\'ve got generalized anxiety disorder,\nwhich is a given.\nI\'ve got nightmare disorder,\nwhich is categorized\nif you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure --\nand all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street\ngoing, "You\'re a failure."\n(Laughter)\nI\'ve got parent-child relational problems,\nwhich I blame my parents for.\n(Laughter)\nI\'m kidding. I\'m not kidding.\nI\'m kidding.\nAnd I\'ve got malingering.\nAnd I think it\'s actually quite rare\nto have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder,\nbecause malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.'
p2394
aS"\nAnyway I was looking through this book,\nwondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was,\nor maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder\nif you're not a trained professional,\nor maybe the psychiatry profession has a strange desire\nto label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.\nI didn't know which of these things was true,\nbut I thought it was kind of interesting.\nAnd I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry\nto get their view.\nWhich is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists."
p2395
aS'\nIt was a man called Brian\nwho runs a crack team of Scientologists\nwho are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies.\nThey\'re called the CCHR.\nAnd I said to him, "Can you prove to me\nthat psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can\'t be trusted?"\nAnd he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you."\nAnd I said, "How?"\nAnd he said, "We\'re going to introduce you to Tony."\nAnd I said, "Who\'s Tony?"\nAnd he said, "Tony\'s in Broadmoor."\nNow Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.\nIt used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane.\nIt\'s where they send the serial killers\nand the people who can\'t help themselves.\nAnd I said to Brian, "What did Tony do?"\nAnd he said, "Hardly anything.\nHe beat someone up or something,\nand he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence.\nBut he faked it too well, and now he\'s stuck in Broadmoor\nand nobody will believe he\'s sane.\nDo you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"\nSo I said, "Yes, please."'
p2396
aS'\nSo I got the train to Broadmoor.\nI began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park,\nwhich apparently is what dogs also do when anxious --\nthey yawn uncontrollably.\nAnd we got to Broadmoor.\nAnd I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate\ninto the wellness center,\nwhich is where you get to meet the patients.\nIt looks like a giant Hampton Inn.\nIt\'s all peach and pine and calming colors.\nAnd the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons.\nAnd the patients started drifting in.\nAnd they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants\nand quite docile looking.\nAnd Brian the Scientologist whispered to me,\n"They\'re medicated,"\nwhich to the Scientologists is like the worst evil in the world,\nbut I\'m thinking it\'s probably a good idea.\n(Laughter)'
p2397
aS'\nAnd then Brian said, "Here\'s Tony."\nAnd a man was walking in.\nAnd he wasn\'t overweight, he was in very good physical shape.\nAnd he wasn\'t wearing sweatpants,\nhe was wearing a pinstriped suit.\nAnd he had his arm outstretched\nlike someone out of The Apprentice.\nHe looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit\nthat would convince me that he was very sane.'
p2398
aS'\nAnd he sat down.\nAnd I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?"\nAnd he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17.\nAnd I was in prison awaiting trial,\nand my cellmate said to me,\n\'You know what you have to do?\nFake madness.\nTell them you\'re mad. You\'ll get sent to some cushy hospital.\nNurses will bring you pizzas.\nYou\'ll have your own Playstation.\'"\nSo I said, "Well how did you do it?"\nHe said, "I asked to see the prison psychiatrist.\nAnd I\'d just seen a film called \'Crash\'\nin which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.\nSo I said to the psychiatrist,\n\'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.\'"\nAnd I said, "What else?"\nHe said, "Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist\nthat I wanted to watch women as they died\nbecause it would make me feel more normal."\nAnd I said, "Where\'d you get that from?"\nHe said, "Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy\nthat they had at the prison library."'
p2399
aS'\nAnyway he faked madness too well, he said.\nAnd they didn\'t send him to some cushy hospital.\nThey sent him to Broadmoor.\nAnd the minute he got there,\nhe said he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist,\nsaid, "There\'s been a terrible misunderstanding.\nI\'m not mentally ill."\nI said, "How long have you been here for?"\nHe said, "Well, if I\'d just done my time in prison for the original crime,\nI\'d have got five years.\nI\'ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years."'
p2400
aS'\nTony said that it\'s a lot harder to convince people you\'re sane\nthan it is to convince them you\'re crazy.\nHe said, "I thought the best way to seem normal\nwould be to talk to people normally about normal things\nlike football or what\'s on TV.\nI subscribe to New Scientist,\nand recently it had an article\nabout how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives.\nSo I said to a nurse,\n\'Did you know that the U.S. army is training bumblebees\nto sniff out explosives?\'\nWhen I read my medical notes,\nI saw they\'d written:\n\'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"\nHe said, "You know, they\'re always looking out\nfor non-verbal clues to my mental state.\nBut how do you sit in a sane way?\nHow do you cross your legs in a sane way?\nIt\'s just impossible."\nAnd when Tony said that to me,\nI thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist?\nAm I crossing my legs like a journalist?"'
p2401
aS'\nHe said, "You know, I\'ve got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me\nand I\'ve got the \'Tiptoe Through the Tulips\' rapist on the other side of me.\nSo I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening.\nAnd they take that as a sign of madness.\nThey say it proves that I\'m aloof and grandiose."\nSo only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers\nbe a sign of madness.\nAnyway he seemed completely normal to me -- but what did I know?'
p2402
aS'\nAnd when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden.\nI said, "What\'s the story?"\nAnd he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence\nbecause his hallucinations that had seemed quite clich to begin with\njust vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor.\nHowever, we have assessed him.\nAnd we have determined that what he is is a psychopath."\nAnd in fact, faking madness\nis exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.\nIt\'s on the checklist: cunning and manipulative.\nSo faking your brain going wrong\nis evidence that your brain has gone wrong.\nAnd I spoke to other experts,\nand they said the pinstriped suit -- classic psychopath.\nSpeaks to items one and two on the checklist --\nglibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.\nAnd I said, "Well, what, he didn\'t want to hang out with the other patients?"\nClassic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.\nSo all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony\nwas evidence, according to his clinician,\nthat he was mad in this new way.\nHe was a psychopath.'
p2403
aS'\nAnd his clinician said to me,\n"If you want to know more about psychopaths,\nyou can go on a psychopath spotting course\nrun by Robert Hare who invented the psychopath checklist."\nSo I did.\nI went on a psychopath spotting course,\nand I am now a certified --\nand I have to say, extremely adept --\npsychopath spotter.'
p2404
aS"\nSo here's the statistics:\nOne in a hundred regular people is a psychopath.\nSo there's 1,500 people in his room.\nFifteen of you are psychopaths.\nAlthough that figure rises to four percent\nof CEO's and business leaders.\nSo I think there's a very good chance\nthere's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room.\nIt could be carnage by the end of the night."
p2405
aS'\n(Laughter) (Laughs)'
p2406
aS'\nHare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless\nrewards psychopathic behavior --\nthe lack of empathy, the glibness,\ncunning, manipulative.\nIn fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless,\nis a physical manifestation of psychopathy.\nIt\'s like a form of psychopathy\nthat\'s come down to affect us all.\nAnd Hare said to me, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor\nwho may or may not have faked madness.\nWho cares? That\'s not a big story.\nThe big story," he said, "is corporate psychopathy.\nYou want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."'
p2407
aS'\nSo I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people.\nI said, "Could I come and interview you in prison\nto find out it you\'re psychopaths?"\nAnd they didn\'t reply.\nSo I changed tack.\nI emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,\nthe asset stripper from the 1990s.\nHe would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce,\njust turn American towns into ghost towns.\nAnd I emailed him and I said,\n"I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly\nthat makes you special\nand interested in the predatory spirit and fearless.\nCan I come and interview you\nabout your special brain anomaly?"\nAnd he said, "Come on over."'
p2408
aS'\nSo I went to Al Dunlap\'s grand Florida mansion\nthat was filled with sculptures of predatory animals.\nThere were lions and tigers.\nHe was taking me through the garden.\nThere were falcons and eagles.\nHe was saying to me, "Over there you\'ve got sharks."\nHe was saying this in a less effeminate way.\n"You\'ve got more sharks and you\'ve got tigers."\nIt was like Narnia.'
p2409
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2410
aS'\nAnd then we went into his kitchen.\nNow Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies.\nHe\'d close down 30 percent of the workforce.\nAnd he\'d quite often fire people with a joke.\nFor instance, one famous story about him,\nsomebody came up to him and said, "I\'ve just bought myself a new car."\nAnd he said, "You may have a new car,\nbut I\'ll tell you what you don\'t have, a job."'
p2411
aS'\nSo in his kitchen -- he was standing there with his wife, Judy,\nand his bodyguard Sean -- and I said, "You know how I said in my email\nthat you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?"\nHe said, "Yeah, it\'s an amazing theory.\nIt\'s like Star Trek. You\'re going where no man has gone before."\nAnd I said, "Well, some psychologists might say\nthat this makes you ... " (Mumbles)\n(Laughter)\nAnd he said, "What?"\nAnd I said, "A psychopath."\nAnd I said, "I\'ve got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket.\nCan I go through them with you?"'
p2412
aS'\nAnd he looked intrigued despite himself,\nand he said, "Okay, go on."\nAnd I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth."\nWhich, I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny\nbecause he was standing underneath a giant oil painting of himself.\n(Laughter)\nHe said, "Well, you\'ve got to believe in you!"\nAnd I said, "Manipulative."\nHe said, "That\'s leadership."\nAnd I said, "Shallow affect:\nan inability to experience a range of emotions."\nHe said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"\nSo he was going down the psychopathic checklist,\nbasically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"'
p2413
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2414
aS"\nBut I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.\nWhenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal --\nlike he said no to juvenile delinquency.\nHe said he got accepted into West Point,\nand they don't let delinquents in West Point.\nHe said no to many short-term marital relationships.\nHe's only ever been married twice.\nAdmittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers\nthat he once threatened her with a knife\nand said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like,\nbut people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument\nand his second marriage has lasted 41 years.\nSo whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,\nI thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book.\nAnd then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter\nhad turned me a little bit psychopathic.\nBecause I was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath.\nI was desperate to define him by his maddest edges."
p2415
aS"\nAnd I realized, oh my God. This is what I've been doing for 20 years.\nIt's what all journalists do.\nWe travel across the world with our notepads in our hands,\nand we wait for the gems.\nAnd the gems are always the outermost aspects\nof our interviewee's personality.\nAnd we stitch them together like medieval monks.\nAnd we leave the normal stuff on the floor.\nAnd this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely.\nChildhood bipolar -- children as young as four\nare being labeled bipolar\nbecause they have temper tantrums,\nwhich scores them high on their bipolar checklist."
p2416
aS'\nWhen I got back to London, Tony phoned me.\nHe said, "Why haven\'t you been returning my calls?"\nI said, "Well they say that you\'re a psychopath."\nAnd he said, "I\'m not a psychopath."\nHe said, "You know what, one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse,\nbut another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative.\nSo when you say you feel remorse for your crime,\nthey say, \'Typical of the psychopath\nto cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn\'t.\'\nIt\'s like witchcraft. They turn everything upside-down."\nHe said, "I\'ve got a tribunal coming up.\nWill you come to it?"\nSo I said okay.'
p2417
aS'\nSo I went to his tribunal.\nAnd after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go.\nThey decided that he shouldn\'t be held indefinitely\nbecause he scores high on a checklist\nthat might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism.\nSo they let him go.\nAnd outside in the corridor he said to me,\n"You know what, Jon?\nEveryone\'s a bit psychopathic."\nHe said, "You are. I am. Well obviously I am."\nI said, "What are you going to do now?"\nHe said, "I\'m going to go to Belgium\nbecause there\'s a woman there that I fancy.\nBut she\'s married, so I\'m going to have to get her split up from her husband."'
p2418
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2419
aS"\nAnyway, that was two years ago,\nand that's where my book ended.\nAnd for the last 20 months everything was fine.\nNothing bad happened.\nHe was living with a girl outside London.\nHe was, according to Brian the Scientologist,\nmaking up for lost time -- which I know sounds ominous,\nbut isn't necessarily ominous.\nUnfortunately, after 20 months,\nhe did go back to jail for a month.\nHe got into a fracas in a bar, he called it --\nended up going to jail for a month,\nwhich I know is bad,\nbut at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was,\nit wasn't too bad."
p2420
aS'\nAnd then he phoned me.\nAnd you know what, I think it\'s right that Tony is out.\nBecause you shouldn\'t define people by their maddest edges.\nAnd what Tony is, is he\'s a semi-psychopath.\nHe\'s a gray area in a world that doesn\'t like gray areas.\nBut the gray areas are where you find the complexity,\nit\'s where you find the humanity\nand it\'s where you find the truth.\nAnd Tony said to me,\n"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?\nI just want to thank you for everything you\'ve done for me."\nAnd I didn\'t go. What would you have done?'
p2421

p2427
aS"\nSo, this is pretty amazing, actually, isn't it?\nBecause nearly every living system\nhas evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.\nSo, for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does.\nAnd yet, even at this most fundamental level,\ncontext is everything.\nWhat I want to talk about is not that context is everything,\nbut why is context everything.\nBecause it's answering that question that tells us not only\nwhy we see what we do,\nbut who we are as individuals,\nand who we are as a society."
p2428
aS'\nBut first, we have to ask another question,\nwhich is, "What is color for?"\nAnd instead of telling you, I\'ll just show you.\nWhat you see here is a jungle scene,\nand you see the surfaces according to the amount\nof light that those surfaces reflect.\nNow, can any of you see the predator that\'s about to jump out at you?\nAnd if you haven\'t seen it yet, you\'re dead. Right?\n(Laughter)\nCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?\nNow, let\'s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect.\nAnd now you see it.'
p2429
aS"\nSo, color enables us to see\nthe similarities and differences between surfaces,\naccording to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.\nBut what you've just done is, in many respects, mathematically impossible.\nWhy? Because, as Berkeley tells us,\nwe have no direct access to our physical world,\nother than through our senses.\nAnd the light that falls onto our eyes\nis determined by multiple things in the world --\nnot only the color of objects,\nbut also the color of their illumination,\nand the color of the space between us and those objects.\nYou vary any one of those parameters,\nand you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye."

Imagine that this is the back of your eye.\nAnd these are two projections from the world.\nThey are identical in every single way.\nIdentical in shape, size, spectral content.\nThey are the same, as far as your eye is concerned.\nAnd yet they come from completely different sources.\nThe one on the right\ncomes from a yellow surface,\nin shadow, oriented facing the left,\nviewed through a pinkish medium.\nThe one on the left comes from an orange surface,\nunder direct light, facing to the right,\nviewed through a sort of a bluish medium.\nCompletely different meanings,\ngiving rise to the exact same retinal information.\nAnd yet it's only the retinal information\nthat we get."
p2431
aS"\nSo how on Earth do we even see?\nSo, if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes,\nremember this: that the light that falls on to your eye,\nsensory information, is meaningless,\nbecause it could mean literally anything.\nAnd what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.\nThere is no inherent meaning in information.\nIt's what we do with that information that matters."
p2432
aS"\nSo, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see.\nSo, the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns,\nfinding relationships in information\nand associating those relationships\nwith a behavioral meaning,\na significance, by interacting with the world.\nWe're very aware of this\nin the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.\nSo, I'm going to give you some letter strings. And I want you to read them out for me,\nif you can."
p2433
aS'\nAudience: "Can you read this?"\n"You are not reading this."\n"What are you reading?"'
p2434
aS'\nBeau Lotto: "What are you reading?" Half the letters are missing. Right?\nThere is no a priori reason why an "H" has to go\nbetween that "W" and "A."\nBut you put one there. Why?\nBecause in the statistics of your past experience\nit would have been useful to do so. So you do so again.\nAnd yet you don\'t put a letter after that first "T."\nWhy? Because it wouldn\'t have been useful in the past.\nSo you don\'t do it again.'
p2435
aS"\nSo let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality,\neven at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.\nSo, if I could have the lights down up here.\nI want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.\nOne is simply the flipping of the other. Okay?\nNow I want you to look at that dot\nbetween the green and the red. Okay?\nAnd I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else.\nAnd we're going to look at that for about 30 seconds,\nwhich is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.\n(Laughter)"
p2436
aS"\nBut I really want you to learn.\nAnd I'll tell you -- don't look anywhere else --\nand I'll tell you what's happening inside your head.\nYour brain is learning. And it's learning that the right side of its visual field\nis under red illumination;\nthe left side of its visual field is under green illumination.\nThat's what it's learning. Okay?\nNow, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.\nSo why don't you do that now?\n(Laughter)\nCan I have the lights up again?"
p2437
aS"\nI take it from your response they don't look the same anymore. Right?\n(Applause)\nWhy? Because your brain is seeing that same information\nas if the right one is still under red light,\nand the left one is still under green light.\nThat's your new normal."
p2438
aS"\nSo, what does this mean for context?\nIt means that I can take these two identical squares,\nand I can put them in light and dark surrounds.\nAnd now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround.\nWhat's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter.\nIt's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past."
p2439
aS"\nSo I'll show you what I mean. Here we have\nthat exact same illusion.\nWe have two identical tiles, on the left,\none in a dark surround, one in a light surround.\nAnd the same thing over on the right.\nNow, what I'm going to do is I'm going to review those two scenes.\nBut I'm not going to change anything within those boxes,\nexcept their meaning.\nAnd see what happens to your perception."
p2440
aS'\nNotice that on the left\nthe two tiles look nearly completely opposite:\none very white and one very dark.\nAll right? Whereas on the right,\nthe two tiles look nearly the same.\nAnd yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround.\nWhy? Because if the tile in that shadow\nwere in fact in shadow,\nand reflecting the same amount of light to your eye\nas the one outside the shadow,\nit would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics.\nSo you see it that way.'
p2441
aS'\nWhereas on the right, the information is consistent\nwith those two tiles being under the same light.\nIf they are under the same light, reflecting the same amount of light\nto your eye,\nthen they must be equally reflective.\nSo you see it that way.\nWhich means we can bring all this information together\nto create some incredibly strong illusions.'
p2442
aS"\nThis is one I made a few years ago.\nAnd you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top,\nand a bright orange tile at the side.\nThat is your perceptual reality. The physical reality\nis that those two tiles are the same."
p2443
aS"\nHere you see four gray tiles on your left,\nseven gray tiles on the right.\nI'm not going to change those tiles at all,\nbut I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene\nand see what happens to your perception.\nThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.\nThe seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.\nThey are the same. Okay?\nDon't believe me? Let's watch it again."
p2444
aS"\nWhat's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.\nSo here we have --\nlet's turn this around -- a diamond.\nAnd what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here,\nand I'm going to spin it.\nAnd for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.\nNow I want you to keep looking at it.\nMove your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.\nAnd suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.\nYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?\nKeep blinking. Every time you blink it will switch. Alright?\nSo I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?\nHow do you know?\nYour brain doesn't know. Because both are equally likely.\nSo depending on where it looks, it flips\nbetween the two possibilities."
p2445
aS"\nAre we the only ones that see illusions?\nThe answer to this question is no.\nEven the beautiful bumblebee,\nwith its mere one million brain cells,\nwhich is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina,\nsees illusions, does the most complicated things\nthat even our most sophisticated computers can't do.\nSo in my lab, we of course work on bumblebees.\nBecause we can completely control their experience,\nand see how that alters the architecture of their brain.\nAnd we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix."
p2446
aS"\nAnd here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee,\nthat large bee in the middle there. Those are all her daughters, the eggs.\nAnd they go back and forth between this hive\nand the arena, via this tube.\nAnd you'll see one of the bees come out here.\nYou see how she has a little number on her?\nYeah there is another one coming out. She has another number on her.\nNow, they are not born that way. Right?\nWe pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep.\nAnd then you can superglue little numbers on them.\n(Laughter)"
p2447
aS"\nAnd now, in this experiment they get rewarded if they go to the blue flowers.\nAnd they land on the flower. They stick their tongue in there,\ncalled a proboscis, and they drink sugar water.\nNow she is drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I,\nwill do that about three times, and then fly.\nAnd sometimes they learn not to go to the blue,\nbut to go to where the other bees go.\nSo they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces.\nAnd here she comes down the ladder.\nAnd she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot\nand throw up, and that's honey.\n(Laughter)"
p2448
aS"\nNow remember -- (Laughter)\n-- she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers.\nBut what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?\nIt looks like they're going to green flowers.\nNow, are they getting it wrong?\nAnd the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers.\nBut those are blue flowers under green light.\nSo they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle,\nwhich is exactly what we do."
p2449
aS'\nSo, illusions are often used,\nespecially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist,\n"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses."\nOkay, this is complete rubbish.\nThe senses aren\'t fragile. And if they were, we wouldn\'t be here.\nInstead, color tells us something completely different,\nthat the brain didn\'t actually evolve to see the world the way it is.\nWe can\'t. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world\nthe way it was useful to see in the past.\nAnd how we see is by continually redefining normality.'
p2450
aS'\nSo how can we take this\nincredible capacity of plasticity of the brain\nand get people to experience their world differently?\nWell, one of the ways we do in my lab and studio\nis we translate the light into sound\nand we enable people to hear their visual world.\nAnd they can navigate the world using their ears.'
p2451
aS"\nHere is David, in the right. And he is holding a camera.\nOn the left is what his camera sees.\nAnd you'll see there is a line, a faint line going across that image.\nThat line is broken up into 32 squares.\nIn each square we calculate the average color.\nAnd then we just simply translate that into sound.\nAnd now he's going to\nturn around, close his eyes,\nand find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed."
p2452
aS'\nHe finds it. Amazing. Right?\nSo not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired,\nbut we can also investigate how people\nliterally make sense of the world.\nBut we can also do something else. We can also make music with color.\nSo, working with kids,\nthey created images,\nthinking about what might the images you see\nsound like if we could listen to them.\nAnd then we translated these images.\nAnd this is one of those images.\nAnd this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music\nfor a 32-piece orchestra.\nAnd this is what it sounds like.\nSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?'
p2453
aS"\nNow, what does all this mean?\nWhat this suggests is that no one is an outside observer\nof nature. Okay?\nWe are not defined by our central properties,\nby the bits that make us up.\nWe're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment --\nby our ecology.\nAnd that ecology is necessarily relative,\nhistorical and empirical.\nSo what I'd like to finish with is this over here.\nBecause what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty.\nBecause I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding."
p2454
aS"\nSo, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain,\nI'd like to do this one.\nSo, if we have the lights down.\nAnd what we have here --\nCan everyone see 25 purple surfaces\non your left,\nand 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?\nSo, now, what I want to do:\nI'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here\nunder yellow illumination\nby simply putting a filter behind them.\nAll right. Now you can see that changes the light\nthat's coming through there. Right?\nBecause now the light is going through a yellowish filter\nand then a purplish filter.\nI'm going to do this opposite on the left here.\nI'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light."
p2455
aS'\nNow, some of you will notice that the consequence is that\nthe light coming through those middle nine on the right,\nor your left,\nis exactly the same as the light coming through\nthe middle nine on your right.\nAgreed? Yes?\nOkay. So they are physically the same.\nLet\'s pull the covers off.\nNow remember,\nyou know the middle nine are exactly the same.\nDo they look the same? No.\nThe question is, "Is that an illusion?"\nAnd I\'ll leave you with that.\nSo, thank you very much.\n(Applause)'

S"\nThere are a lot of ways the people around us\ncan help improve our lives.\nWe don't bump into every neighbor,\nso a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,\nthough we do share the same public spaces."
p2458
aS"\nSo over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more\nwith my neighbors in public space,\nusing simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk.\nAnd these projects came from questions I had, like,\nhow much are my neighbors paying for their apartments?\n(Laughter) How can we lend and borrow more things\nwithout knocking on each other's doors at a bad time?\nHow can we share more of our memories\nof our abandoned buildings,\nand gain a better understanding of our landscape?\nAnd how can we share more of our hopes\nfor our vacant storefronts, so our communities\ncan reflect our needs and dreams today?"

aS'\nNow, I live in New Orleans,\nand I am in love with New Orleans.\nMy soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees,\nshading lovers, drunks and dreamers\nfor hundreds of years, and I trust a city\nthat always makes way for music. (Laughter)\nI feel like every time someone sneezes,\nNew Orleans has a parade. (Laughter)\nThe city has some of the most beautiful architecture\nin the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts\nof abandoned properties in America.'
p2460
aS'\nI live near this house, and I thought about how I could\nmake it a nicer space for my neighborhood,\nand I also thought about something\nthat changed my life forever.'
p2461
aS"\nIn 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.\nHer name was Joan, and she was a mother to me,\nand her death was sudden and unexpected.\nAnd I thought about death a lot,\nand\nthis made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had,\nand\nbrought clarity to the things that are meaningful\nto my life now.\nBut I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.\nI feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day,\nand forget what really matters to you."
p2462
aS'\nSo with help from old and new friends,\nI turned the side of this abandoned house\ninto a giant chalkboard and stenciled it\nwith a fill-in-the-blank sentence:\n"Before I die, I want to ... "\nSo anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk,\nreflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations\nin public space.'
p2463
aS"\nI didn't know what to expect from this experiment,\nbut by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out,\nand it kept growing.\nAnd I'd like to share a few things\nthat people wrote on this wall."

(Laughter)\n"Before I die, I want to straddle the International Date Line."\n"Before I die, I want to sing for millions."\n"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."\n"Before I die, I want to live off the grid."\n"Before I die, I want to hold her one more time."\n"Before I die, I want to be someone\'s cavalry."\n"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."'
p2465
aS"\nSo this neglected space became a constructive one,\nand people's hopes and dreams\nmade me laugh out loud, tear up,\nand they consoled me during my own tough times.\nIt's about knowing you're not alone.\nIt's about understanding our neighbors\nin new and enlightening ways.\nIt's about making space for reflection and contemplation,\nand remembering what really matters most to us\nas we grow and change."

aS"\nI made this last year, and started receiving\nhundreds of messages from passionate people\nwho wanted to make a wall with their community,\nso my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit, and now\nwalls have been made in countries around the world,\nincluding Kazakhstan, South Africa,\nAustralia,\nArgentina and beyond.\nTogether, we've shown how powerful our public spaces\ncan be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice\nand share more with one another."
p2467
aS"\nTwo of the most valuable things we have are time\nand our relationships with other people.\nIn our age of increasing distractions,\nit's more important than ever to find ways to maintain\nperspective and remember that life is brief and tender.\nDeath is something that we're often discouraged\nto talk about or even think about, but\nI've realized that preparing for death\nis one of the most empowering things you can do.\nThinking about death clarifies your life."

p2472
aS'\nSo I asked everybody in my life\nwhat they thought.\nI turned to my grandmother,\nwho always had plenty of advice,\nand she said, "Stop being so picky.\nYou\'ve got to date around.\nAnd most importantly,\ntrue love will find you when you least expect it."'
p2473
aS"\nNow as it turns out,\nI'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,\nas you'll soon find.\nI am constantly swimming in numbers\nand formulas and charts.\nI also have a very tight-knit family,\nand I'm very, very close with my sister,\nand as a result, I wanted to have\nthe same type of family when I grew up."
p2474
aS"\nSo I'm at the end of this bad breakup,\nI'm 30 years old,\nI figure I'm probably going to have\nto date somebody for about six months\nbefore I'm ready to get monogamous\nand before we can sort of cohabitate,\nand we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged.\nAnd if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35,\nthat meant that I would have had to have been\non my way to marriage five years ago.\nSo that wasn't going to work."
p2475
aS"\nIf my strategy was to least-expect my way\ninto true love, then the variable that I had\nto deal with was serendipity.\nIn short, I was trying to figure out, well,\nwhat's the probability of my finding Mr. Right?\nWell, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia,\nand it's a big city, and I figured,\nin this entire place, there are lots of possibilities.\nSo again, I started doing some math.\nPopulation of Philadelphia: It has 1.5 million people.\nI figure about half of that are men,\nso that takes the number down to 750,000.\nI'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36,\nwhich was only four percent of the population,\nso now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men.\nI was looking for somebody who was Jewish,\nbecause that's what I am and that was important to me.\nThat's only 2.3 percent of the population.\nI figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10\nof those men,\nand there was no way I was going\nto deal with somebody who was an avid golfer.\nSo that basically meant there were 35 men for me\nthat I could possibly date\nin the entire city of Philadelphia."
p2476
aS'\nIn the meantime, my very large Jewish family\nwas already all married and well on their way\nto having lots and lots of children,\nand I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure\nto get my life going already.'
p2477
aS"\nSo if I have two possible strategies at this point\nI'm sort of figuring out.\nOne, I can take my grandmother's advice\nand sort of least-expect my way\ninto maybe bumping into the one\nout of 35 possible men in the entire\n1.5 million-person city of Philadelphia,\nor I could try online dating.\nNow, I like the idea of online dating,\nbecause it's predicated on an algorithm,\nand that's really just a simple way of saying\nI've got a problem, I'm going to use some data,\nrun it through a system\nand get to a solution.\nSo online dating is the second most popular way\nthat people now meet each other,\nbut as it turns out, algorithms have been around\nfor thousands of years in almost every culture.\nIn fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers\na long time ago, and though\nthey didn't have an explicit algorithm per se,\nthey definitely were running through formulas in their heads,\nlike, is the girl going to like the boy?\nAre the families going to get along?\nWhat's the rabbi going to say?\nAre they going to start having children right away?\nAnd the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this,\nput two people together, and that would be the end of it.\nSo in my case, I thought,\nwell, will data and an algorithm\nlead me to my Prince Charming?\nSo I decided to sign on."
p2478
aS"\nNow, there was one small catch.\nAs I'm signing on to the various dating websites,\nas it happens, I was really, really busy.\nBut that actually wasn't the biggest problem.\nThe biggest problem is that I hate\nfilling out questionnaires of any kind,\nand I certainly don't like questionnaires\nthat are like Cosmo quizzes.\nSo I just copied and pasted from my rsum."

aS"\nSo obviously this was not the best way\nto put my most sexy foot forward.\nBut the real failure was that\nthere were plenty of men for me to date.\nThese algorithms had a sea full of men\nthat wanted to take me out on lots of dates --\nwhat turned out to be truly awful dates.\nThere was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.\nThe algorithm matched us up\nbecause we share a love of gadgets,\nwe share a love of math and data and '80s music,\nand so I agreed to go out with him.\nSo Steve the I.T. guy invited me out\nto one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth,\nextremely expensive restaurants.\nAnd we went in, and right off the bat,\nour conversation really wasn't taking flight,\nbut he was ordering a lot of food.\nIn fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu.\nHe was ordering multiple appetizers,\nmultiple entres, for me as well,\nand suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table,\nalso lots and lots of bottles of wine.\nSo we're nearing the end of our conversation\nand the end of dinner, and I've decided\nSteve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other,\nbut we'll part ways as friends,\nwhen he gets up to go to the bathroom,\nand in the meantime the bill comes to our table.\nAnd listen, I'm a modern woman.\nI am totally down with splitting the bill.\nBut then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back.

p2491
aS'\nAnd as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up,\nsomething interesting happened --\nactually a bunch of interesting things happened.\nThe first was the feedback from my cousins.\nThey told me\nthat they preferred me on YouTube than in person.\n(Laughter)\nAnd once you get over the backhanded nature of that,\nthere was actually something very profound there.\nThey were saying\nthat they preferred the automated version of their cousin\nto their cousin.\nAt first, it\'s very unintuitive,\nbut when you actually think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense.\nYou have this situation\nwhere now they can pause and repeat their cousin,\nwithout feeling like they\'re wasting my time.\nIf they have to review something\nthat they should have learned a couple of weeks ago,\nor maybe a couple of years ago,\nthey don\'t have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin.\nThey can just watch those videos. If they\'re bored, they can go ahead.\nThey can watch it at their own time, at their own pace.\nAnd probably the least appreciated aspect of this\nis the notion that the very first time,\nthe very first time\nthat you\'re trying to get your brain around a new concept,\nthe very last thing you need\nis another human being saying, "Do you understand this?"\nAnd that\'s what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before,\nand now they can just do it\nin the intimacy of their own room.'

aS'\nThe other thing that happened --\nand even at this point, I said, "Okay, maybe it\'s a good supplement.\nIt\'s good for motivated students.\nIt\'s good for maybe home schoolers."\nBut I didn\'t think it would be something\nthat would somehow penetrate the classroom.\nBut then I started getting letters from teachers.\nAnd the teachers would write, saying,\n"We\'ve used your videos to flip the classroom.\nYou\'ve given the lectures, so now what we do ... " --\nand this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow --\n" ... what I do is I assign the lectures for homework,\nand what used to be homework,\nI now have the students doing in the classroom."'
p2500
aS"\nAnd I want to pause here for --\n(Applause)\nI want to pause here for a second,\nbecause there's a couple of interesting things.\nOne, when those teachers are doing that,\nthere's the obvious benefit --\nthe benefit that now their students\ncan enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did.\nThey can pause, repeat at their own pace,\nat their own time.\nBut the more interesting thing is --\nand this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom --\nby removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom\nand letting students have a self-paced lecture at home,\nand then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work,\nhaving the teacher walk around,\nhaving the peers actually be able to interact with each other,\nthese teachers have used technology\nto humanize the classroom.\nThey took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience --\n30 kids with their fingers on their lips,\nnot allowed to interact with each other.\nA teacher, no matter how good,\nhas to give this one-size-fits-all lecture\nto 30 students --\nblank faces, slightly antagonistic --\nand now it's a human experience.\nNow they're actually interacting with each other."
p2501
aS"\nSo once the Khan Academy --\nI quit my job\nand we turned into a real organization --\nwe're a not-for-profit --\nthe question is, how do we take this to the next level?\nHow do we take what those teachers are doing\nto their natural conclusion?\nAnd so what I'm showing you over here,\nthese are actual exercises\nthat I started writing for my cousins.\nThe ones I started were much more primitive.\nThis is a more competent version of it.\nBut the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need\nuntil you get that concept,\nuntil you get 10 in a row.\nAnd the Khan Academy videos are there.\nYou get hints, the actual steps for that problem,\nif you don't know how to do it.\nBut the paradigm here, it seems like a very simple thing:\n10 in a row, you move on.\nBut it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now."
p2502
aS'\nIn a traditional classroom,\nyou have a couple of homework,\nhomework, lecture, homework, lecture,\nand then you have a snapshot exam.\nAnd that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent,\na 90 percent or a 95 percent,\nthe class moves on to the next topic.\nAnd even that 95 percent student,\nwhat was the five percent they didn\'t know?\nMaybe they didn\'t know what happens when you raise something to the zero power.\nAnd then you go build on that in the next concept.\nThat\'s analogous to\nimagine learning to ride a bicycle,\nand maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,\nand I give you that bicycle for two weeks.\nAnd then I come back after two weeks,\nand I say, "Well, let\'s see. You\'re having trouble taking left turns.\nYou can\'t quite stop.\nYou\'re an 80 percent bicyclist."\nSo I put a big C stamp on your forehead\nand then I say, "Here\'s a unicycle."\nBut as ridiculous as that sounds,\nthat\'s exactly what\'s happening\nin our classrooms right now.\nAnd the idea is you fast forward\nand good students start failing algebra all of a sudden\nand start failing calculus all of a sudden,\ndespite being smart, despite having good teachers,\nand it\'s usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps\nthat kept building throughout their foundation.\nSo our model\nis learn math the way you\'d learn anything,\nlike the way you would learn a bicycle.\nStay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.\nDo it as long as necessary until you have mastery.\nThe traditional model,\nit penalizes you for experimentation and failure,\nbut it does not expect mastery.\nWe encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to failure.\nBut we do expect mastery.'
p2503
aS"\nThis is just another one of the modules.\nThis is trigonometry.\nThis is shifting and reflecting functions.\nAnd they all fit together.\nWe have about 90 of these right now.\nAnd you can go to the site right now. It's all free. Not trying to sell anything.\nBut the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map.\nThat top node right there, that's literally single digit addition.\nIt's like one plus one is equal to two.\nAnd the paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that,\nit keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules.\nSo if you keep further down the knowledge map,\nwe're getting into more advanced arithmetic.\nFurther down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra.\nFurther down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two,\na little bit of precalculus.\nAnd the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything --\nwell, everything that can be taught\nin this type of a framework.\nSo you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on --\nis from this knowledge map\nyou have logic, you have computer programming,\nyou have grammar, you have genetics,\nall based off of that core of,\nif you know this and that,\nnow you're ready for this next concept.\nNow that can work well for an individual learner,\nand I encourage, one, for you to do it with your kids,\nbut I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.\nIt'll change what happens at the dinner table."
p2504
aS"\nBut what we want to do\nis to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom\nthat those early teachers had emailed me about.\nAnd so what I'm showing you here,\nthis is actually data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district,\nwhere they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes\nand completely gutted their old math curriculum.\nThese kids aren't using textbooks,\nthey're not getting one-size-fits-all lectures.\nThey're doing Khan Academy, they're doing that software,\nfor roughly half of their math class.\nAnd I want to make it clear, we don't view this as the complete math education.\nWhat it does is -- and this is what's happening in Los Altos --\nit frees up time.\nThis is the blocking and tackling,\nmaking sure you know how to move through a system of equations,\nand it frees up time for the simulations, for the games,\nfor the mechanics, for the robot building,\nfor the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow."
p2505
aS'\nAnd so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day,\nevery kid works at their own pace --\nand this is actually a live dashboard from Los Altos school district --\nand they look at this dashboard.\nEvery row is a student.\nEvery column is one of those concepts.\nGreen means the student\'s already proficient.\nBlue means they\'re working on it -- no need to worry.\nRed means they\'re stuck.\nAnd what the teacher does is literally just say,\n"Let me intervene on the red kids."\nOr even better, "Let me get one of the green kids\nwho are already proficient in that concept\nto be the first line of attack\nand actually tutor their peer."'
p2506
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2507
aS'\nNow I come from a very data-centric reality,\nso we don\'t want that teacher to even go and intervene\nand have to ask the kid awkward questions:\n"Oh, what do you not understand?" or "What do you do understand?"\nand all of the rest.\nSo our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible --\nreally data that, in almost any other field, is expected,\nif you\'re in finance or marketing or manufacturing --\nand so the teachers can actually diagnose what\'s wrong with the students\nso they can make their interaction as productive as possible.\nSo now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to,\nhow long they have been spending every day, what videos have they been watching,\nwhen did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching,\nwhat exercises are they using,\nwhat have they been focused on?\nThe outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.\nThe inner circle shows the videos they\'re focused on.\nAnd the data gets pretty granular\nso you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong.\nRed is wrong, blue is right.\nThe leftmost question is the first question that the student attempted.\nThey watched the video right over there.\nAnd then you can see, eventually, they were able to get 10 in a row.\nIt\'s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems.\nThey also got faster.\nThe height is how long it took them.'
p2508
aS'\nSo when you talk about self-paced learning,\nit makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak, differentiated learning --\nbut it\'s kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom.\nBecause every time we\'ve done this,\nin every classroom we\'ve done,\nover and over again, if you go five days into it,\nthere\'s a group of kids who\'ve raced ahead\nand there\'s a group of kids who are a little bit slower.\nAnd in a traditional model, if you did a snapshot assessment,\nyou say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids.\nMaybe they should be tracked differently.\nMaybe we should put them in different classes."\nBut when you let every student work at their own pace --\nand we see it over and over and over again --\nyou see students who took a little bit [of] extra time\non one concept or the other,\nbut once they get through that concept,\nthey just race ahead.\nAnd so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago,\nyou now would think are gifted.\nAnd we\'re seeing it over and over and over again.\nAnd it makes you really wonder\nhow much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from\nwere really just due to a coincidence of time.'
p2509
aS"\nNow as valuable as something like this is\nin a district like Los Altos,\nour goal is to use technology\nto humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale,\nwhat's happening in education.\nAnd actually, that kind of brings an interesting point.\nA lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom\nis focused on student-to-teacher ratios.\nIn our mind, the relevant metric\nis student-to-valuable-human-time-\nwith-the-teacher ratio.\nSo in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time\nis spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot.\nMaybe five percent of their time is actually sitting next to students\nand actually working with them.\nNow 100 percent of their time is.\nSo once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom,\nyou're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue,\nby a factor of five or 10."
p2510
aS"\nAnd as valuable as that is in Los Altos,\nimagine what that does to the adult learner\nwho's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff\nthat they should have before, before going back to college.\nImagine what it does\nto a street kid in Calcutta\nwho has to help his family during the day,\nand that's the reason why he or she can't go to school.\nNow they can spend two hours a day and remediate,\nor get up to speed and not feel embarrassed\nabout what they do or don't know.\nNow imagine what happens where --\nwe talked about the peers teaching each other\ninside of a classroom.\nBut this is all one system.\nThere's no reason why you can't have\nthat peer-to-peer tutoring\nbeyond that one classroom.\nImagine what happens if that student in Calcutta\nall of a sudden can tutor your son,\nor your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta?\nAnd I think what you'll see emerging\nis this notion of a global one-world classroom.\nAnd that's essentially what we're trying to build."

aS"\nBG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos,\nhow did that come about?"
p2517
aS'\nSK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.\nOnce again, I didn\'t expect it to be used in classrooms.\nSomeone from their board came and said,\n"What would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom?"\nAnd I said, "Well, I would just, every student work at their own pace\non something like this and we\'d give a dashboard."\nAnd they said, "Oh, this is kind of radical.

p2521
aS"\nBG: So some of those views we saw\nwere for the teacher\nto go in and track actually what's going on with those kids.\nSo you're getting feedback on those teacher views\nto see what they think they mean?"
p2522
aS'\nSK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers.\nWe made some of those for students so they could see their data,\nbut we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves.\nAnd they\'re literally saying, "Hey, this is nice, but ... "\nLike that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said,\n"I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around\nand not focusing on one topic."\nSo we made that focus diagram.\nSo it\'s all been teacher-driven.\nIt\'s been pretty crazy.'

aa(lp2530
S"\nI coined my own definition of success\nin 1934, when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana,\nbeing a little bit disappointed, and delusioned perhaps, by\nthe way parents of the youngsters in my English classes\nexpected their youngsters to\nget an A or a B. They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children,\nbecause the neighbors children are all average.\nBut they weren't satisfied when their own --\nwould make the teacher feel that they had failed, or the youngster had failed.\nAnd that's not right. The good Lord in his infinite wisdom\ndidn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned,\nany more than we're equal for size, appearance.\nNot everybody could earn an A or a B, and I didn't like that way of judging it."
p2531
aS"\nAnd I did know how the alumni of various schools\nback in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams.\nIf you won them all, you were considered to be reasonably successful --\nnot completely. Because I found out --\nwe had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game.\nBut it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin\nthat some of our alumni had predicted and\nquite frequently I --\n(Laughter)\n-- quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions\nin a more materialistic manner.\nBut that was true back in the 30s, so I understood that.\nBut I didn't like it. And I didn't agree with it.\nAnd I wanted to come up with something that I hoped could make me a better teacher,\nand give the youngsters under my supervision --\nwhether it be in athletics or in the English classroom --\nsomething to which to aspire,\nother than just a higher mark\nin the classroom, or more points in some athletic contest."
p2532
aS'\nI thought about that for quite a spell,\nand I wanted to come up with my own definition. I thought that might help.\nAnd I knew how Mr. Webster defined it:\nas the accumulation of material possessions\nor the attainment of a position of power or prestige, or something of that sort --\nworthy accomplishments perhaps,\nbut in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success.\nSo I wanted to come up with something of my own.'
p2533
aS'\nAnd I recalled -- I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana\nand Dad tried to teach me and my brothers\nthat you should never try to be better than someone else.\nI\'m sure at the time he did that, I didn\'t -- it didn\'t --\nwell, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of mind,\nit popped out years later.\nNever try to be better than someone else,\nalways learn from others. Never cease\ntrying to be the best you can be -- that\'s under your control.\nIf you get too engrossed and involved and concerned\nin regard to the things over which you have no control,\nit will adversely affect the things over which you have control.\nThen I ran across this simple verse that said,\n"At God\'s footstool to confess, a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.\n\'I failed!\' He cried.\nThe Master said, \'Thou didst thy best, that is success.\'"'
p2534
aS"\nFrom those things, and one other perhaps,\nI coined my own definition of success,\nwhich is: peace of mind attained only through\nself-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best\nof which you're capable.\nI believe that's true. If you make the effort\nto do the best of which you're capable, to try and improve the situation\nthat exists for you, I think that's success.\nAnd I don't think others can judge that. I think it's like character and reputation.\nYour reputation is what you are perceived to be;\nyour character is what you really are.\nAnd I think that character is much more\nimportant than what you are perceived to be.\nYou'd hope they'd both be good,\nbut they won't necessarily be the same.\nWell, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters."
p2535
aS"\nI ran across other things. I love to teach,\nand it was mentioned by the previous speaker\nthat I enjoy poetry, and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.\nThere are some things that helped me, I think,\nbe better than I would have been. I know I'm not what I ought to be,\nnot what I should be. But I think I'm better than I would have been\nif I hadn't run across certain things.\nOne was just a little verse that said,"
p2536
aS'\n"No written word, no spoken plea\ncan teach our youth what they should be.\nNor all the books on all the shelves --\nit\'s what the teachers are themselves."'
p2537
aS"\nThat made an impression on me\nin the 1930s.\nAnd I tried to use that more or less in my teaching,\nwhether it be in sports, or whether it be in the English classroom.\nI love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow.\nMaybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night.\nCoal oil lamp -- we didn't have electricity\nin our farm home.\nAnd Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it.\nAnd about the same time I ran across this one verse,\nI ran across another one. Someone asked\na lady teacher why she taught.\nAnd she -- after some time, she said she wanted to think about that.\nThen she came up and said,"
p2538
aS'\n"They ask me why I teach\nand I reply, \'Where could I find such splendid company?\'\nThere sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise;\nanother Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.\nA doctor sits beside him,\nwhose quick steady hand may mend a bone,\nor stem the life-blood\'s flow.\nAnd there a builder. Upward rise the arch of a church he builds,\nwherein that minister may speak the word of God\nand lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ.\nAnd all about a gathering of teachers,\nfarmers, merchants, laborers:\nthose who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.\nAnd I may say, I may not see the church,\nor hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow.\nBut yet again I may. And later I may say,\nI knew him once, and he was weak, or strong,\nor bold or proud or gay.\nI knew him once, but then he was a boy.\nThey ask me why I teach and I reply,\n\'Where could I find such splendid company?\'"'
p2539
aS"\nAnd I believe the teaching profession --\nit's true, you have so many youngsters.\nAnd I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA --\n30-some attorneys, 11 dentists and doctors,\nmany, many teachers and other professions.\nAnd that gives you a great deal of pleasure,\nto see them go on.\nI always tried to make the youngsters feel\nthat they're there to get an education, number one.\nBasketball was second, because it was paying their way,\nand they do need a little time for social activities,\nbut you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two\nand you're not going to have any very long.\nSo that was the ideas that I tried to get across\nto the youngsters under my supervision."
p2540
aS"\nI had three rules, pretty much, that I stuck with practically all the time.\nI'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,\nand I decided they were very important.\nOne was -- never be late. Never be late.\nLater on I said certain things --\nI had -- players, if we're leaving for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.\nThere was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties.\nThen I saw our chancellor coming to school\nin denims and turtlenecks, and I thought,\nnot right for me to keep this other.\nSo I let them -- just they had to be neat and clean.\nI had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of,\nBill Walton. He came to catch the bus;\nwe were leaving for somewhere to play.\nAnd he wasn't clean and neat, so I wouldn't let him go.\nHe couldn't get on the bus. He had to go home and get cleaned up\nto get to the airport.\nSo I was a stickler for that. I believed in that.\nI believe in time -- very important.\nI believe you should be on time. But I felt at practice, for example,\nwe start on time, we close on time.\nThe youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over."
p2541
aS'\nWhen I speak at coaching clinics, I often tell\nyoung coaches -- and at coaching clinics, more or less,\nthey\'ll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.\nMost of them are young, you know, and probably newly married.\nAnd I tell them, "Don\'t run practices late.\nBecause you\'ll go home in a bad mood.\nAnd that\'s not good, for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.\nWhen you get older, it doesn\'t make any difference." But --'
p2542
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2543
aS"\nSo I did believe on time. I believe starting on time,\nand I believe closing on time.\nAnd another one I had was, not one word of profanity.\nOne word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.\nIf I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.\nAnd the third one was, never criticize a teammate.\nI didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that.\nThat's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.\nNot like the coaches today, for gracious sakes, no.\nIt's a little different than it was in my day.\nThose were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time.\nAnd those actually came from my dad.\nThat's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time."
p2544
aS"\nI came up with a pyramid eventually,\nthat I don't have the time to go on that.\nBut that helped me, I think, become a better teacher.\nIt's something like this:\nAnd I had blocks in the pyramid,\nand the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm,\nworking hard and enjoying what you're doing,\ncoming up to the apex\naccording to my definition of success.\nAnd right at the top -- faith and patience.\nAnd I say to you, in whatever you're doing,\nyou must be patient. You have to have patience to --\nwe want things to happen. We talk about our youth being impatient a lot.\nAnd they are. They want to change everything.\nThey think all change is progress.\nAnd we get a little older -- we sort of let things go.\nAnd we forget there is no progress without change.\nSo you must have patience.\nAnd I believe that we must have faith.\nI believe that we must believe,\ntruly believe. Not just give it word service;\nbelieve that things will work out as they should,\nproviding we do what we should.\nI think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to\nmuch of the time. But we don't do the things that are necessary\nto make those things become reality.\nI worked on this for some 14 years,\nand I think it helped me become a better teacher.\nBut it all revolved around that original definition of success."
p2545
aS"\nYou know a number of years ago, there was a Major\nLeague Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty.\nHe spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.\nI'd never seen that before, but he did.\nBig league baseball players --\nthey're very perceptive about those things,\nand they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name.\nYou'd be surprised how many also told him\nthat that was one more than he had in his head\nat various times."
p2546
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2547
aS'\nBut he wrote something that I think he did\nwhile I tried to do in this pyramid. He called it "The Road Ahead,\nor the Road Behind."\n"Sometimes I think the Fates must\ngrin as we denounce them and insist\nthe only reason we can\'t win, is the Fates themselves that miss.\nYet there lives on the ancient claim:\nwe win or lose within ourselves. The shining trophies on our shelves\ncan never win tomorrow\'s game.\nYou and I know deeper down, there\'s always a chance to win the crown.\nBut when we fail to give our best,\nwe simply haven\'t met the test, of giving all\nand saving none until the game is really won;\nof showing what is meant by grit;\nof playing through when others quit;\nof playing through, not letting up.\nIt\'s bearing down that wins the cup. Of dreaming there\'s a goal ahead;\nof hoping when our dreams are dead;\nof praying when our hopes have fled.\nYet losing, not afraid to fall,\nif bravely we have given all. For who can ask more of a man\nthan giving all within his span.\nGiving all, it seems to me, is not so far from victory.\nAnd so the fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind.\nIt\'s you and I who make our fates --\nwe open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind."'
p2548
aS"\nReminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us.\nDon't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses.\nJust get out there, and whatever you're doing,\ndo it to the best of your ability.\nAnd no one can do more than that.\nI tried to get across, too, that --\nmy opponents don't tell you -- you never heard me mention winning.\nNever mention winning. My idea is\nthat you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game.\nAnd you can win when you're outscored.\nI've felt that way on certain occasions,\nat various times.\nAnd I just wanted them to be able to\nhold their head up after a game.\nI used to say that when a game is over,\nand you see somebody that didn't know the outcome,\nI hope they couldn't tell by your actions\nwhether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you."
p2549
aS'\nThat\'s what really matters: if you make effort\nto do the best you can regularly,\nthe results will be about what they should be.\nNot necessary to what you would want them to be,\nbut they will be about what they should,\nand only you will know whether you can do that.\nAnd that\'s what I wanted from them more than anything else.\nAnd as time went by, and I learned more about other things,\nI think it worked a little better,\nas far as the results. But I wanted the score of a game to be\nthe byproduct of these other things,\nand not the end itself.\nI believe it was --\none great philosopher said -- no, no,\nCervantes. Cervantes said,\n"The journey is better than the end."\nAnd I like that. I think that is --\nit\'s getting there. Sometimes when you get there, there\'s almost a letdown.\nBut there\'s getting there that\'s the fun.\nI liked our -- as a basketball coach at UCLA I liked our practices to be the journey,\nand the game would be the end. The end result.\nI\'d like to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play,\nand see whether I\'d done a decent job\nduring the week.\nThere again, it\'s getting the players to get that self-satisfaction,\nin knowing that they\'d made the effort to do\nthe best of which they are capable.'

aS'\nSometimes I\'m asked who was\nthe best player I had, or the best teams.\nI can never answer that,\nas far as the individuals are concerned.\nI was asked one time about that,\nand they said, "Suppose that you in some way could\nmake the perfect player. What would you want?"\nAnd I said, "Well, I\'d want one that knew why he was at UCLA:\nto get an education, he was a good student,\nreally knew why he was there in the first place.\nBut I\'d want one that could play, too.\nI\'d want one to realize that\ndefense usually wins championships, and would work hard on defense.\nBut I\'d want one that would play offense too.\nI\'d want him to be unselfish,\nand look for the pass first and not shoot all the time.\nAnd I\'d want one that could pass and would pass.'

aS'\nI mention in my book, "They Call Me Coach."\nTwo players that gave me great satisfaction;\nthat came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential:\none was Conrad Burke. And one was Doug McIntosh.\nWhen I saw them as freshmen,\non our freshmen team --\nwe didn\'t have -- freshmen couldn\'t play varsity when I taught.\nAnd I thought, "Oh gracious, if these two players, either one of them" --\nthey were different years, but I thought about each one at the time he was there --\n"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,\nour varsity must be pretty miserable, if he\'s good enough to make it."\nAnd you know one of them\nwas a starting player for a season and a half.\nThe other was -- his next year, he played\n32 minutes in a national championship game,\ndid a tremendous job for us. And the next year, he was a starting player\non the national championship team.\nAnd here I thought he\'d never play a minute, when he was --\nso those are the things that give you great joy,\nand great satisfaction to see one.\nNeither one of those youngsters could shoot very well.\nBut they had outstanding shooting percentages,\nbecause they didn\'t force it.\nAnd neither one could jump very well,\nbut they got -- kept good position,\nand so they did well rebounding. They remembered that\nevery shot that is taken, they assumed would be missed.\nI\'ve had too many that stand around and wait to see if it\'s missed,\nthen they go and it\'s too late.\nSomebody else is in there ahead of them.\nAnd they weren\'t very quick, but they played good position,\nkept in good balance.\nAnd so they played pretty good defense for us.\nSo they had qualities that -- they came close to --\nas close to reaching possibly their full potential\nas any players I ever had.\nSo I consider them to be as successful as\nLewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,\nor many of the others that we had, There was some outstanding -- some outstanding players.'

p2568
aS"\nHave you ever wondered why being around children\nwho smile so frequently\nmakes you smile very often?\nA recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden\nfound that it's very difficult to frown\nwhen looking at someone who smiles.\nYou ask, why?\nBecause smiling is evolutionarily contagious,\nand it suppresses the control\nwe usually have on our facial muscles.\nMimicking a smile\nand experiencing it physically\nhelp us understand whether our smile is fake or real,\nso we can understand the emotional state\nof the smiler."
p2569
aS'\nIn a recent mimicking study\nat the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France,\nsubjects were asked to determine\nwhether a smile was real or fake\nwhile holding a pencil in their mouth\nto repress smiling muscles.\nWithout the pencil, subjects were excellent judges,\nbut with the pencil in their mouth --\nwhen they could not mimic the smile they saw --\ntheir judgment was impaired.'

p2571
aS'\nIn addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species,"\nCharles Darwin also wrote\nthe facial feedback response theory.\nHis theory states\nthat the act of smiling itself\nactually makes us feel better --\nrather than smiling being merely a result\nof feeling good.\nIn his study,\nDarwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,\nwho used electric jolts to facial muscles\nto induce and stimulate smiles.\nPlease, don\'t try this at home.'
p2572
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2573
aS"\nIn a related German study,\nresearchers used fMRI imaging\nto measure brain activity\nbefore and after injecting Botox\nto suppress smiling muscles.\nThe finding supported Darwin's theory\nby showing that facial feedback\nmodifies the neural processing\nof emotional content in the brain\nin a way that helps us feel better when we smile.\nSmiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism\nin a way that even chocolate --\na well-regarded pleasure inducer --\ncannot match."
p2574
aS"\nBritish researchers found that one smile\ncan generate the same level of brain stimulation\nas up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.\n(Laughter)\nWait. The same study found\nthat smiling is as stimulating\nas receiving up to 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash.\nThat's like 25 grand a smile.\nIt's not bad.\nAnd think about it this way:\n25,000 times 400 --\nquite a few kids out there\nfeel like Mark Zuckerberg every day."
p2575
aS'\nAnd, unlike lots of chocolate,\nlots of smiling can actually make you healthier.\nSmiling can help reduce the level\nof stress-enhancing hormones\nlike cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,\nincrease the level of mood-enhancing hormones\nlike endorphin\nand reduce overall blood pressure.'
p2576
aS"\nAnd if that's not enough,\nsmiling can actually make you look good\nin the eyes of others.\nA recent study at Penn State University\nfound that when you smile,\nyou don't only appear to be more likable and courteous,\nbut you actually appear to be more competent."

p2581
aS"\nIt's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.\nIt's perhaps harder than ever before\nto stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.\nI want to look now, if I may,\nat some of the reasons why\nwe might be feeling anxiety about our careers.\nWhy we might be victims of these career crises,\nas we're weeping softly into our pillows.\nOne of the reasons why we might be suffering\nis that we are surrounded by snobs."
p2582
aS"\nIn a way, I've got some bad news,\nparticularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.\nThere is a real problem with snobbery.\nBecause sometimes people from outside the U.K.\nimagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon\nfixated on country houses and titles.\nThe bad news is that's not true.\nSnobbery is a global phenomenon.\nWe are a global organization. This is a global phenomenon.\nIt exists. What is a snob?\nA snob is anybody who takes a small part of you\nand uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.\nThat is snobbery."
p2583
aS'\nThe dominant kind of snobbery\nthat exists nowadays is job snobbery.\nYou encounter it within minutes at a party,\nwhen you get asked that famous iconic question\nof the early 21st century, "What do you do?"\nAnd according to how you answer that question,\npeople are either incredibly delighted to see you,\nor look at their watch and make their excuses.\n(Laughter)'
p2584
aS"\nNow, the opposite of a snob is your mother.\n(Laughter)\nNot necessarily your mother, or indeed mine,\nbut, as it were, the ideal mother,\nsomebody who doesn't care about your achievements.\nBut unfortunately, most people are not our mothers.\nMost people make a strict correlation between how much time,\nand if you like, love -- not romantic love,\nthough that may be something --\nbut love in general, respect,\nthey are willing to accord us, that will be strictly defined\nby our position in the social hierarchy."
p2585
aS'\nAnd that\'s a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers\nand indeed start caring so much about material goods.\nYou know, we\'re often told that we live in very materialistic times,\nthat we\'re all greedy people.\nI don\'t think we are particularly materialistic.\nI think we live in a society\nwhich has simply pegged certain emotional rewards\nto the acquisition of material goods.\nIt\'s not the material goods we want. It\'s the rewards we want.\nAnd that\'s a new way of looking at luxury goods.\nThe next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari\ndon\'t think, "This is somebody who is greedy."\nThink, "This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love."\nIn other words -- (Laughter)\nfeel sympathy, rather than contempt.'
p2586
aS"\nThere are other reasons --\n(Laughter)\nthere are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now\nto feel calm than ever before.\nOne of these, and it's paradoxical because it's linked to something that's rather nice,\nis the hope we all have for our careers.\nNever before have expectations been so high\nabout what human beings can achieve with their lifespan.\nWe're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything.\nWe've done away with the caste system.\nWe are now in a system where anyone can rise\nto any position they please.\nAnd it's a beautiful idea.\nAlong with that is a kind of spirit of equality. We're all basically equal.\nThere are no strictly defined\nkind of hierarchies."
p2587
aS"\nThere is one really big problem with this,\nand that problem is envy.\nEnvy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,\nbut if there is one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy.\nAnd it's linked to the spirit of equality. Let me explain.\nI think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching,\nto be envious of the Queen of England.\nEven though she is much richer than any of you are.\nAnd she's got a very large house.\nThe reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.\nShe's simply too strange.\nWe can't relate to her. She speaks in a funny way.\nShe comes from an odd place.\nSo we can't relate to her. And when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them."
p2588
aS"\nThe closer two people are, in age, in background,\nin the process of identification, the more there is a danger of envy --\nwhich is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion --\nbecause there is no stronger reference point\nthan people one was at school with.\nBut the problem, generally, of modern society, is that it turns the whole world\ninto a school. Everybody is wearing jeans, everybody is the same.\nAnd yet, they're not.\nSo there is a spirit of equality, combined with deep inequalities.\nWhich makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation."
p2589
aS'\nIt\'s probably as unlikely that you would nowadays\nbecome as rich and famous as Bill Gates,\nas it was unlikely in the 17th century\nthat you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.\nBut the point is, it doesn\'t feel that way.\nIt\'s made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets,\nthat if you\'ve got energy, a few bright ideas about technology,\na garage, you too could start a major thing.\n(Laughter)\nAnd the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops.\nWhen you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections,\nas I sometimes do,\nif you analyze self-help books that are produced\nin the world today, there are basically two kinds.\nThe first kind tells you, "You can do it! You can make it! Anything is possible!"\nAnd the other kind tells you how to cope\nwith what we politely call "low self-esteem,"\nor impolitely call "feeling very bad about yourself."'
p2590
aS"\nThere is a real correlationship,\na real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything\nand the existence of low self-esteem.\nSo that's another way in which something that is quite positive\ncan have a nasty kickback.\nThere is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious,\nabout our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.\nAnd it is, again, linked to something nice,\nand that nice thing is called meritocracy."
p2591
aS"\nEverybody, all politicians on Left and Right,\nagree that meritocracy is a great thing,\nand we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic.\nIn other words, what is a meritocratic society?\nA meritocratic society is one in which\nif you've got talent and energy and skill,\nyou will get to the top. Nothing should hold you back.\nIt's a beautiful idea. The problem is\nif you really believe in a society\nwhere those who merit to get to the top, get to the top,\nyou'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way,\nbelieve in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom\nalso get to the bottom and stay there.\nIn other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental,\nbut merited and deserved.\nAnd that makes failure seem much more crushing."
p2592
aS'\nYou know, in the Middle Ages, in England,\nwhen you met a very poor person,\nthat person would be described as an "unfortunate" --\nliterally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.\nNowadays, particularly in the United States,\nif you meet someone at the bottom of society,\nthey may unkindly be described as a "loser."\nThere is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser,\nand that shows 400 years of evolution in society\nand our belief in who is responsible for our lives.\nIt\'s no longer the gods, it\'s us. We\'re in the driving seat.'
p2593
aS"\nThat's exhilarating if you're doing well,\nand very crushing if you're not.\nIt leads, in the worst cases, in the analysis of a sociologist\nlike Emil Durkheim, it leads to increased rates of suicide.\nThere are more suicides in developed individualistic countries\nthan in any other part of the world.\nAnd some of the reason for that is that people take what happens\nto them extremely personally.\nThey own their success. But they also own their failure."
p2594
aS"\nIs there any relief from some of these pressures\nthat I've just been outlining?\nI think there is. I just want to turn to a few of them.\nLet's take meritocracy.\nThis idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to,\nI think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.\nI will support any politician of Left and Right,\nwith any halfway decent meritocratic idea.\nI am a meritocrat in that sense.\nBut I think it's insane to believe that we will ever\nmake a society that is genuinely meritocratic. It's an impossible dream."
p2595
aS"\nThe idea that we will make a society\nwhere literally everybody is graded,\nthe good at the top, and the bad at the bottom,\nand it's exactly done as it should be, is impossible.\nThere are simply too many random factors:\naccidents, accidents of birth,\naccidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc.\nWe will never get to grade them,\nnever get to grade people as they should."
p2596
aS'\nI\'m drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"\nwhere he says, "It\'s a sin to judge any man by his post."\nIn modern English that would mean\nit\'s a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to\ndependent on their business card.\nIt\'s not the post that should count.\nAccording to St. Augustine,\nit\'s only God who can really put everybody in their place.\nAnd he\'s going to do that on the Day of Judgment\nwith angels and trumpets, and the skies will open.\nInsane idea, if you\'re a secularist person, like me.\nBut something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless.'
p2597
aS"\nIn other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people.\nYou don't necessarily know what someone's true value is.\nThat is an unknown part of them.\nAnd we shouldn't behave as though it is known.\nThere is another source of solace and comfort for all this.\nWhen we think about failing in life, when we think about failure,\none of the reasons why we fear failing is not just\na loss of income, a loss of status.\nWhat we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists."
p2598
aS'\nYou know, the number one organ of ridicule\nnowadays, is the newspaper.\nAnd if you open the newspaper any day of the week,\nit\'s full of people who\'ve messed up their lives.\nThey\'ve slept with the wrong person. They\'ve taken the wrong substance.\nThey\'ve passed the wrong piece of legislation. Whatever it is.\nAnd then are fit for ridicule.\nIn other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."\nNow is there any alternative to this?\nI think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative,\nand that is tragedy.'
p2599
aS'\nTragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece,\nin the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form\ndevoted to tracing how people fail,\nand also according them a level of sympathy,\nwhich ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.\nI remember a few years ago, I was thinking about all this,\nand I went to see "The Sunday Sport,"\na tabloid newspaper that I don\'t recommend you to start reading\nif you\'re not familiar with it already.\nI went to talk to them\nabout certain of the great tragedies of Western art.\nI wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones\nof certain stories if they came in as a news item\nat the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.'
p2600
aS'\nSo I told them about Othello. They had not heard of it but were fascinated by it.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I asked them to write the headline for the story of Othello.\nThey came up with "Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator\'s Daughter"\nsplashed across the headline.\nI gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.\nAgain, a book they were enchanted to discover.\nAnd they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."\n(Laughter)\nAnd then my favorite.\nThey really do have a kind of genius all of their own, these guys.\nMy favorite is Sophocles\' Oedipus the King:\n"Sex With Mum Was Blinding"\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)'
p2601
aS"\nIn a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy,\nyou've got the tabloid newspaper.\nAt the other end of the spectrum you've got tragedy and tragic art,\nand I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit\nabout what's happening in tragic art.\nIt would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.\nHe is not a loser, though he has lost.\nAnd I think that is the message of tragedy to us,\nand why it's so very, very important, I think."
p2602
aS"\nThe other thing about modern society\nand why it causes this anxiety\nis that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.\nWe are the first society to be living in a world\nwhere we don't worship anything other than ourselves.\nWe think very highly of ourselves, and so we should.\nWe've put people on the moon. We've done all sorts of extraordinary things.\nAnd so we tend to worship ourselves."
p2603
aS"\nOur heroes are human heroes.\nThat's a very new situation.\nMost other societies have had, right at their center,\nthe worship of something transcendent: a god,\na spirit, a natural force, the universe,\nwhatever it is, something else that is being worshiped.\nWe've slightly lost the habit of doing that,\nwhich is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.\nNot for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way,\nbut because it's an escape from the human anthill.\nIt's an escape from our own competition,\nand our own dramas.\nAnd that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans,\nand contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters, etc.\nWe like to feel in contact with something that is non-human,\nand that is so deeply important to us."
p2604
aS'\nWhat I think I\'ve been talking about really is success and failure.\nAnd one of the interesting things about success\nis that we think we know what it means.\nIf I said to you that there is somebody behind the screen\nwho is very very successful, certain ideas would immediately come to mind.\nYou would think that person might have made a lot of money,\nachieved renown in some field.\nMy own theory of success -- and I\'m somebody\nwho is very interested in success. I really want to be successful.\nI\'m always thinking, "How could I be more successful?"\nBut as I get older, I\'m also very nuanced\nabout what that word "success" might mean.'
p2605
aS"\nHere's an insight that I've had about success.\nYou can't be successful at everything.\nWe hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.\nNonsense. You can't have it all. You can't.\nSo any vision of success\nhas to admit what it's losing out on,\nwhere the element of loss is.\nI think any wise life will accept,\nas I say, that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding."
p2606
aS"\nThing about a successful life\nis, a lot of the time, our ideas\nof what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.\nThey are sucked in from other people:\nchiefly, if you're a man, your father,\nand if you're a woman, your mother.\nPsychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years.\nNo one is quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe that that's true."
p2607
aS"\nAnd we also suck in messages\nfrom everything from the television, to advertising,\nto marketing, etc.\nThese are hugely powerful forces\nthat define what we want and how we view ourselves.\nWhen we're told that banking is a very respectable profession\na lot of us want to go into banking.\nWhen banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking.\nWe are highly open to suggestion."
p2608
aS"\nSo what I want to argue for is not that we should give up\non our ideas of success,\nbut we should make sure that they are our own.\nWe should focus in on our ideas\nand make sure that we own them,\nthat we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.\nBecause it's bad enough, not getting what you want,\nbut it's even worse to have an idea\nof what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey,\nthat it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along."
p2609
aS"\nSo I'm going to end it there.\nBut what I really want to stress is\nby all means, success, yes.\nBut let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.\nLet's probe away at our notions of success.\nLet's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause)"
p2610
aS'\nChris Anderson: That was fascinating. How do you reconcile\nthis idea of someone being --\nit being bad to think of someone as a loser\nwith the idea, that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life.\nAnd that a society that encourages that\nperhaps has to have some winners and losers.'
p2611
aS"\nAlain de Botton: Yes. I think it's merely the randomness\nof the winning and losing process that I wanted to stress.\nBecause the emphasis nowadays is so much\non the justice of everything,\nand politicians always talk about justice.\nNow I am a firm believer in justice, I just think that it is impossible.\nSo we should do everything we can,\nwe should do everything we can to pursue it.\nBut at the end of the day we should always remember\nthat whoever is facing us, whatever has happened in their lives,\nthere will be a strong element of the haphazard.\nAnd it's that that I'm trying to leave room for.\nBecause otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic."
p2612
aS"\nCA: I mean, do you believe that you can combine\nyour kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work\nwith a successful economy?\nOr do you think that you can't?\nBut it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that?"
p2613
aS"\nAB: The nightmare thought\nis that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them,\nand that somehow the crueler the environment\nthe more people will rise to the challenge.\nYou want to think, who would you like as your ideal dad?\nAnd your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle.\nAnd it's a very hard line to make.\nWe need fathers, as it were, the exemplary father figures in society,\navoiding the two extremes,\nwhich is the authoritarian, disciplinarian, on the one hand,\nand on the other, the lax, no rules option."

That\'s the only way you\'ll ever do it."\nSo I said, "Okay, if I have to do it -- "\nI had a sabbatical. I said, "I\'ll write about my research\nif there is no other way. And then I\'ll get to do my cookbook."\nSo I wrote a book on my research.'
p2620
aS"\nAnd it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.\nFirst of all, I enjoyed writing.\nBut the more interesting thing was that\nI started learning from people.\nIt's a fantastic time to write,\nbecause there is so much feedback you can get from people.\nPeople write me about their personal experience,\nand about their examples, and what they disagree,\nand nuances.\nAnd even being here -- I mean the last few days,\nI've known really heights of obsessive behavior\nI never thought about.\n(Laughter)\nWhich I think is just fascinating."
p2621
aS'\nI will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.\nAnd I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion\nas a metaphor for rationality.\nSo think about these two tables.\nAnd you must have seen this illusion.\nIf I asked you what\'s longer, the vertical line on the table on the left,\nor the horizontal line on the table on the right?\nWhich one seems longer?\nCan anybody see anything but the left one being longer?\nNo, right? It\'s impossible.\nBut the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.\nSo I can put some lines on; it doesn\'t help.\nI can animate the lines.\nAnd to the extent you believe I didn\'t shrink the lines,\nwhich I didn\'t, I\'ve proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you.\nNow, the interesting thing about this\nis when I take the lines away,\nit\'s as if you haven\'t learned anything in the last minute.\n(Laughter)\nYou can\'t look at this and say, "Okay now I see reality as it is."\nRight? It\'s impossible to overcome this\nsense that this is indeed longer.\nOur intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable, predictable, consistent way.\nAnd there is almost nothing we can do about it,\naside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.'
p2622
aS"\nHere is another one -- this is one of my favorite illusions.\nWhat do you see the color that top arrow is pointing to?\nBrown. Thank you.\nThe bottom one? Yellow.\nTurns out they're identical.\nCan anybody see them as identical?\nVery very hard.\nI can cover the rest of the cube up.\nAnd if I cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical.\nAnd if you don't believe me you can get the slide later\nand do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.\nBut again it's the same story\nthat if we take the background away,\nthe illusion comes back. Right.\nThere is no way for us not to see this illusion.\nI guess maybe if you're colorblind I don't think you can see that.\nI want you to think about illusion as a metaphor."
p2623
aS"\nVision is one of the best things we do.\nWe have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision --\nbigger than dedicated to anything else.\nWe do more vision more hours of the day than we do anything else.\nAnd we are evolutionarily designed to do vision.\nAnd if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision,\nwhich we're so good at,\nwhat's the chance that we don't make even more mistakes\nin something we're not as good at --\nfor example, financial decision making:\n(Laughter)\nsomething we don't have an evolutionary reason to do,\nwe don't have a specialized part of the brain,\nand we don't do that many hours of the day.\nAnd the argument is in those cases\nit might be the issue that we actually make many more mistakes\nand, worse, not have an easy way to see them.\nBecause in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes;\nin cognitive illusion it's much, much harder\nto demonstrate to people the mistakes."
p2624
aS"\nSo I want to show you some cognitive illusions,\nor decision-making illusions, in the same way.\nAnd this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.\nIt's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.\nAnd it basically shows\nthe percentage of people who indicated\nthey would be interested in giving their organs to donation.\nAnd these are different countries in Europe. And you basically\nsee two types of countries:\ncountries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot;\nand countries on the left that seem to giving very little,\nor much less.\nThe question is, why? Why do some countries give a lot\nand some countries give a little?"
p2625
aS'\nWhen you ask people this question,\nthey usually think that it has to be something about culture.\nRight? How much do you care about people?\nGiving your organs to somebody else\nis probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.\nOr maybe it is about religion.\nBut, if you look at this plot,\nyou can see that countries that we think about as very similar\nactually exhibit very different behavior.\nFor example, Sweden is all the way on the right,\nand Denmark, that we think is culturally very similar,\nis all the way on the left.\nGermany is on the left. And Austria is on the right.\nThe Netherlands is on the left. And Belgium is on the right.\nAnd finally, depending on your particular version\nof European similarity,\nyou can think about the U.K and France as either similar culturally or not.\nBut it turns out that from organ donation they are very different.'
p2626
aS'\nBy the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story.\nYou see the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group.\nTurns out that they got to 28 percent\nafter mailing every household in the country a letter\nbegging people to join this organ donation program.\nYou know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far"?\nIt\'s 28 percent in organ donation.'
p2627
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2628
aS"\nBut whatever the countries on the right are doing\nthey are doing a much better job than begging.\nSo what are they doing?\nTurns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.\nAnd here is the story.\nThe countries on the left have a form at the DMV\nthat looks something like this.\nCheck the box below if you want to participate\nin the organ donor program.\nAnd what happens?\nPeople don't check, and they don't join.\nThe countries on the right, the ones that give a lot,\nhave a slightly different form.\nIt says check the box below if you don't want to participate.\nInterestingly enough, when people get this,\nthey again don't check -- but now they join."
p2629
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2630
aS'\nNow think about what this means.\nWe wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.\nWe wake up in the morning and we open the closet\nand we feel that we decide what to wear.\nAnd we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.\nWhat this is actually saying is that\nmuch of these decisions are not residing within us.\nThey are residing in the person who is designing that form.\nWhen you walk into the DMV,\nthe person who designed the form will have a huge influence\non what you\'ll end up doing.\nNow it\'s also very hard to intuit these results. Think about it for yourself.\nHow many of you believe\nthat if you went to renew your license tomorrow,\nand you went to the DMV,\nand you would encounter one of these forms,\nthat it would actually change your own behavior?\nVery, very hard to think that you will influence us.\nWe can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans, of course it would influence them."\nBut when it comes to us,\nwe have such a feeling that we are at the driver\'s seat,\nwe have such a feeling that we are in control,\nand we are making the decision,\nthat it\'s very hard to even accept\nthe idea that we actually have\nan illusion of making a decision, rather than an actual decision.'
p2631
aS'\nNow, you might say,\n"These are decisions we don\'t care about."\nIn fact, by definition, these are decisions\nabout something that will happen to us after we die.\nHow could we care about something less\nthan something that happens after we die?\nSo a standard economist, someone who believes in rationality,\nwould say, "You know what? The cost of lifting the pencil\nand marking a V is higher than the possible\nbenefit of the decision,\nso that\'s why we get this effect."\nBut, in fact, it\'s not because it\'s easy.\nIt\'s not because it\'s trivial. It\'s not because we don\'t care.\nIt\'s the opposite. It\'s because we care.\nIt\'s difficult and it\'s complex.\nAnd it\'s so complex that we don\'t know what to do.\nAnd because we have no idea what to do\nwe just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.'
p2632
aS'\nI\'ll give you one more example for this.\nThis is from a paper by Redelmeier and Schaefer.\nAnd they said, "Well, this effect also happens to experts,\npeople who are well-paid, experts in their decisions,\ndo it a lot."\nAnd they basically took a group of physicians.\nAnd they presented to them a case study of a patient.\nHere is a patient. He is a 67-year-old farmer.\nHe\'s been suffering from a right hip pain for a while.\nAnd then they said to the physician,\n"You decided a few weeks ago\nthat nothing is working for this patient.\nAll these medications, nothing seems to be working.\nSo you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy.\nHip replacement. Okay?"\nSo the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.\nAnd then they said to half the physicians, they said,\n"Yesterday you reviewed the patient\'s case\nand you realized that you forgot to try one medication.\nYou did not try ibuprofen.\nWhat do you do? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?\nOr do you let them go and have hip replacement?"\nWell the good news is that most physicians in this case\ndecided to pull the patient and try the ibuprofen.\nVery good for the physicians.'
p2633
aS'\nThe other group of the physicians, they said,\n"Yesterday when you reviewed the case\nyou discovered there were two medications you didn\'t try out yet,\nibuprofen and piroxicam."\nAnd they said, "You have two medications you didn\'t try out yet. What do you do?\nYou let them go. Or you pull them back.\nAnd if you pull them back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"\nNow think of it. This decision\nmakes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement.\nBut pulling them back, all of the sudden becomes more complex.\nThere is one more decision.\nWhat happens now?\nMajority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go\nto hip replacement.\nI hope this worries you, by the way --\n(Laughter)\nwhen you go to see your physician.\nThe thing is is that no physician would ever say,\n"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.\nLet\'s go for hip replacement."\nBut the moment you set this as the default\nit has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.'
p2634
aS'\nI\'ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.\nImagine I give you a choice.\nDo you want to go for a weekend to Rome?\nAll expenses paid:\nhotel, transportation, food, breakfast,\na continental breakfast, everything.\nOr a weekend in Paris?\nNow, a weekend in Paris, a weekend in Rome, these are different things;\nthey have different food, different culture, different art.\nNow imagine I added a choice to the set\nthat nobody wanted.\nImagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,\na weekend in Paris, or having your car stolen?"\n(Laughter)\nIt\'s a funny idea, because why would having your car stolen,\nin this set, influence anything?\n(Laughter)\nBut what if the option to have your car stolen\nwas not exactly like this.\nWhat if it was a trip to Rome, all expenses paid,\ntransportation, breakfast,\nbut doesn\'t include coffee in the morning.\nIf you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself. It\'s two euros 50.\nNow in some ways,\ngiven that you can have Rome with coffee,\nwhy would you possibly want Rome without coffee?\nIt\'s like having your car stolen. It\'s an inferior option.\nBut guess what happened. The moment you add Rome without coffee,\nRome with coffee becomes more popular. And people choose it.\nThe fact that you have Rome without coffee\nmakes Rome with coffee look superior,\nand not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris.\n(Laughter)'
p2635
aS'\nHere are two examples of this principle.\nThis was an ad from The Economist a few years ago\nthat gave us three choices.\nAn online subscription for 59 dollars.\nA print subscription for 125.\nOr you could get both for 125.\n(Laughter)\nNow I looked at this and I called up The Economist.\nAnd I tried to figure out what were they thinking.\nAnd they passed me from one person to another to another,\nuntil eventually I got to a person who was in charge of the website.\nAnd I called them up. And they went to check what was going on.\nThe next thing I know, the ad is gone. And no explanation.'
p2636
aS'\nSo I decided to do the experiment\nthat I would have loved The Economist to do with me.\nI took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.\nI said, "What would you choose?"\nThese are the market share. Most people wanted the combo deal.\nThankfully nobody wanted the dominated option.\nThat means our students can read.\n(Laughter)\nBut now if you have an option that nobody wants,\nyou can take it off. Right?\nSo I printed another version of this,\nwhere I eliminated the middle option.\nI gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happens.\nNow the most popular option became the least popular.\nAnd the least popular became the most popular.'
p2637
aS"\nWhat was happening was the option that was useless,\nin the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.\nBut it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out\nwhat they wanted.\nIn fact, relative to the option in the middle,\nwhich was get only the print for 125,\nthe print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal.\nAnd as a consequence, people chose it.\nThe general idea here, by the way,\nis that we actually don't know our preferences that well.\nAnd because we don't know our preferences that well\nwe're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces:\nthe defaults, the particular options that are presented to us, and so on."
p2638
aS'\nOne more example of this.\nPeople believe that when we deal with physical attraction,\nwe see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not,\nattracted or not.\nWhich is why we have these four-minute dates.\nSo I decided to do this experiment with people.\nI\'ll show you graphic images of people -- not real people.\nThe experiment was with people.\nI showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.\nI said "Who do you want to date? Tom or Jerry?"\nBut for half the people I added an ugly version of Jerry.\nI took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.\n(Laughter)\nThe other people, I added an ugly version of Tom.\nAnd the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom\nhelp their respective, more attractive brothers?\nThe answer was absolutely yes.\nWhen ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.\nWhen ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.'
p2639
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2640
aS"\nThis of course has two very clear implications\nfor life in general.\nIf you ever go bar hopping, who do you want to take with you?\n(Laughter)\nYou want a slightly uglier version of yourself.\n(Laughter)\nSimilar. Similar ... but slightly uglier.\n(Laughter)\nThe second point, or course, is that\nif somebody else invites you, you know how they think about you.\n(Laughter)\nNow you're getting it."
p2641
aS'\nWhat is the general point?\nThe general point is that when we think about economics we have\nthis beautiful view of human nature.\n"What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!"\nWe have this view of ourselves, of others.\nThe behavioral economics perspective\nis slightly less generous to people.\nIn fact in medical terms, that\'s our view.\n(Laughter)\nBut there is a silver lining.\nThe silver lining is, I think,\nkind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.\nAre we Superman? Or are we Homer Simpson?'
p2642
aS"\nWhen it comes to building the physical world,\nwe kind of understand our limitations.\nWe build steps. And we build these things\nthat not everybody can use obviously.\n(Laughter)\nWe understand our limitations,\nand we build around it.\nBut for some reason when it comes to the mental world,\nwhen we design things like healthcare and retirement and stockmarkets,\nwe somehow forget the idea that we are limited.\nI think that if we understood our cognitive limitations\nin the same way that we understand our physical limitations,\neven though they don't stare us in the face in the same way,\nwe could design a better world.\nAnd that, I think, is the hope of this thing."

aS'\nImagine yourself standing\noutside the front door of your home.\nI\'d like you to notice the color of the door,\nthe material that it\'s made out of.\nNow visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.\nThey are competing in a naked bicycle race,\nand they are headed straight for your front door.\nI need you to actually see this.\nThey are pedaling really hard, they\'re sweaty,\nthey\'re bouncing around a lot.\nAnd they crash straight into the front door of your home.\nBicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,\nspokes end up in awkward places.\nStep over the threshold of your door\ninto your foyer, your hallway, whatever\'s on the other side,\nand appreciate the quality of the light.\nThe light is shining down on Cookie Monster.\nCookie Monster is waving at you\nfrom his perch on top of a tan horse.\nIt\'s a talking horse.\nYou can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.\nYou can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he\'s about to shovel into his mouth.\nWalk past him.

aS'\nOkay. Open your eyes.'
p2649
aS"\nI want to tell you about a very bizarre contest\nthat is held every spring in New York City.\nIt's called the United States Memory Championship.\nAnd I had gone to cover this contest a few years back\nas a science journalist\nexpecting, I guess, that this was going to be\nlike the Superbowl of savants.\nThis was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,\nwidely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep."
p2650
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2651
aS'\nThey were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,\nlooking at them just once.\nThey were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.\nThey were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.\nThey were competing to see who could memorize\nthe order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.\nI was like, this is unbelievable.\nThese people must be freaks of nature.'
p2652
aS'\nAnd I started talking to a few of the competitors.\nThis is a guy called Ed Cook\nwho had come over from England\nwhere he had one of the best trained memories.\nAnd I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize\nthat you were a savant?"\nAnd Ed was like, "I\'m not a savant.\nIn fact, I have just an average memory.\nEverybody who competes in this contest\nwill tell you that they have just an average memory.\nWe\'ve all trained ourselves\nto perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory\nusing a set of ancient techniques,\ntechniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,\nthe same techniques that Cicero had used\nto memorize his speeches,\nthat medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."\nAnd I was like, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"'
p2653
aS'\nAnd we were standing outside the competition hall,\nand Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant,\nbut somewhat eccentric English guy,\nsays to me, "Josh, you\'re an American journalist.\nDo you know Britney Spears?"\nI\'m like, "What? No. Why?"\n"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears\nhow to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards\non U.S. national television.\nIt will prove to the world that anybody can do this."'
p2654
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2655
aS'\nI was like, "Well I\'m not Britney Spears,\nbut maybe you could teach me.\nI mean, you\'ve got to start somewhere, right?"\nAnd that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.'
p2656
aS"\nI ended up spending the better part of the next year\nnot only training my memory,\nbut also investigating it,\ntrying to understand how it works,\nwhy it sometimes doesn't work\nand what its potential might be."
p2657
aS"\nI met a host of really interesting people.\nThis is a guy called E.P.\nHe's an amnesic who had, very possibly,\nthe very worst memory in the world.\nHis memory was so bad\nthat he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,\nwhich is amazing.\nAnd he was this incredibly tragic figure,\nbut he was a window into the extent\nto which our memories make us who we are."
p2658
aS'\nThe other end of the spectrum: I met this guy.\nThis is Kim Peek.\nHe was the basis for Dustin Hoffman\'s character in the movie "Rain Man."\nWe spent an afternoon together\nin the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books,\nwhich was scintillating.'
p2659
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2660
aS'\nAnd I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,\ntreatises written 2,000-plus years ago\nin Latin in Antiquity\nand then later in the Middle Ages.\nAnd I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.\nOne of the really interesting things that I learned\nis that once upon a time,\nthis idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory\nwas not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.\nOnce upon a time, people invested in their memories,\nin laboriously furnishing their minds.'
p2661
aS"\nOver the last few millenia\nwe've invented a series of technologies --\nfrom the alphabet to the scroll\nto the codex, the printing press, photography,\nthe computer, the smartphone --\nthat have made it progressively easier and easier\nfor us to externalize our memories,\nfor us to essentially outsource\nthis fundamental human capacity.\nThese technologies have made our modern world possible,\nbut they've also changed us.\nThey've changed us culturally,\nand I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.\nHaving little need to remember anymore,\nit sometimes seems like we've forgotten how."
p2662
aS"\nOne of the last places on Earth\nwhere you still find people passionate about this idea\nof a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory\nis at this totally singular memory contest.\nIt's actually not that singular,\nthere are contests held all over the world.\nAnd I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it."
p2663
aS'\nA few years back a group of researchers at University College London\nbrought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.\nThey wanted to know:\nDo these guys have brains\nthat are somehow structurally, anatomically different from the rest of ours?\nThe answer was no.\nAre they smarter than the rest of us?\nThey gave them a bunch of cognitive tests,\nand the answer was not really.'
p2664
aS"\nThere was however one really interesting and telling difference\nbetween the brains of the memory champions\nand the control subjects that they were comparing them to.\nWhen they put these guys in an fMRI machine,\nscanned their brains\nwhile they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,\nthey found that the memory champions\nwere lighting up different parts of the brain\nthan everyone else.\nOf note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,\na part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.\nWhy? And is there something the rest of us can learn from this?"
p2665
aS'\nThe sport of competitive memorizing\nis driven by a kind of arms race\nwhere every year somebody comes up\nwith a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,\nand then the rest of the field has to play catchup.'
p2666
aS'\nThis is my friend Ben Pridmore,\nthree-time world memory champion.\nOn his desk in front of him\nare 36 shuffled packs of playing cards\nthat he is about to try to memorize in one hour,\nusing a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.\nHe used a similar technique\nto memorize the precise order\nof 4,140 random binary digits\nin half an hour.\nYeah.'
p2667
aS'\nAnd while there are a whole host of ways\nof remembering stuff in these competitions,\neverything, all of the techniques that are being used,\nultimately come down to a concept\nthat psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding.'
p2668
aS'\nAnd it\'s well illustrated by a nifty paradox\nknown as the Baker/baker paradox,\nwhich goes like this:\nIf I tell two people to remember the same word,\nif I say to you,\n"Remember that there is a guy named Baker."\nThat\'s his name.\nAnd I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."\nAnd I come back to you at some point later on,\nand I say, "Do you remember that word\nthat I told you a while back?\nDo you remember what it was?"\nThe person who was told his name is Baker\nis less likely to remember the same word\nthan the person was told his job is that he is a baker.\nSame word, different amount of remembering; that\'s weird.\nWhat\'s going on here?'
p2669
aS"\nWell the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.\nIt is entirely untethered\nfrom all of the other memories floating around in your skull.\nBut the common noun baker,\nwe know bakers.\nBakers wear funny white hats.\nBakers have flour on their hands.\nBakers smell good when they come home from work.\nMaybe we even know a baker.\nAnd when we first hear that word,\nwe start putting these associational hooks into it\nthat make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.\nThe entire art of what is going on\nin these memory contests\nand the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life\nis figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers\ninto lower-case B bakers --\nto take information that is lacking in context,\nin significance, in meaning\nand transform it in some way\nso that it becomes meaningful\nin the light of all the other things that you have in your mind."
p2670
aS"\nOne of the more elaborate techniques for doing this\ndates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.\nIt came to be known as the memory palace.\nThe story behind its creation goes like this:\nThere was a poet called Simonides\nwho was attending a banquet.\nHe was actually the hired entertainment,\nbecause back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,\nyou didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.\nAnd he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,\nand at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses,\nkills everybody inside.\nIt doesn't just kill everybody,\nit mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.\nNobody can say who was inside,\nnobody can say where they were sitting.\nThe bodies can't be properly buried.\nIt's one tragedy compounding another.\nSimonides, standing outside,\nthe sole survivor amid the wreckage,\ncloses his eyes and has this realization,\nwhich is that in his mind's eye,\nhe can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.\nAnd he takes the relatives by the hand\nand guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage."
p2671
aS'\nWhat Simonides figured out at that moment\nis something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,\nwhich is that, as bad as we are\nat remembering names and phone numbers\nand word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,\nwe have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.\nIf I asked you to recount the first 10 words\nof the story that I just told you about Simonides,\nchances are you would have a tough time with it.\nBut I would wager\nthat if I asked you to recall\nwho is sitting on top of a talking tan horse\nin your foyer right now,\nyou would be able to see that.'
p2672
aS"\nThe idea behind the memory palace\nis to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye\nand populate it with images\nof the things that you want to remember --\nthe crazier, weirder, more bizarre,\nfunnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,\nthe more unforgettable it's likely to be.\nThis is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years\nto the earliest Latin memory treatises."
p2673
aS"\nSo how does this work?\nLet's say that you've been invited\nto TED center stage to give a speech\nand you want to do it from memory,\nand you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it\nif he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.\nWhat you might do\nis picture yourself at the front door of your house.\nAnd you'd come up with some sort\nof an absolutely crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image\nto remind you that the first thing you want to talk about\nis this totally bizarre contest.\nAnd then you'd go inside your house,\nand you would see an image of Cookie Monster\non top of Mister Ed.\nAnd that would remind you\nthat you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.\nAnd then you'd see an image of Britney Spears\nto remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.\nAnd you go into your kitchen,\nand the fourth topic you were going to talk about\nwas this strange journey that you went on for a year,\nand you have some friends to help you remember that."
p2674
aS'\nThis is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --\nnot word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,\nbut topic-for-topic.\nIn fact, the phrase "topic sentence,"\nthat comes from the Greek word "topos,"\nwhich means "place."\nThat\'s a vestige\nof when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric\nin these sorts of spatial terms.\nThe phrase "in the first place,"\nthat\'s like in the first place of your memory palace.'
p2675
aS"\nI thought this was just fascinating,\nand I got really into it.\nAnd I went to a few more of these memory contests.\nAnd I had this notion that I might write something longer\nabout this subculture of competitive memorizers.\nBut there was a problem.\nThe problem was that a memory contest\nis a pathologically boring event.\n(Laughter)\nTruly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs.\nI mean, the most dramatic it gets\nis when somebody starts massaging their temples.\nAnd I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.\nI know that there's this incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,\nbut I don't have access to it."

aS"\nAnd I realized, if I was going to tell this story,\nI needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.\nAnd so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes\nevery morning before I sat down with my New York Times\njust trying to remember something.\nMaybe it was a poem.\nMaybe it was names from an old yearbook\nthat I bought at a flea market.\nAnd I found that this was shockingly fun.\nI never would have expected that.\nIt was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.\nWhat you're doing is you're trying to get better and better and better\nat creating, at dreaming up,\nthese utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious\nand hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.\nAnd I got pretty into it."

p2681
aS"\nWe often talk about people with great memories\nas though it were some sort of an innate gift,\nbut that is not the case.\nGreat memories are learned.\nAt the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.\nWe remember when we are deeply engaged.\nWe remember when we are able\nto take a piece of information and experience\nand figure out why it is meaningful to us,\nwhy it is significant, why it's colorful,\nwhen we're able to transform it in some way\nthat it makes sense\nin the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,\nwhen we're able to transform Bakers into bakers."
p2682
aS"\nThe memory palace, these memory techniques,\nthey're just shortcuts.\nIn fact, they're not even really shortcuts.\nThey work because they make you work.\nThey force a kind of depth of processing,\na kind of mindfulness,\nthat most of us don't normally walk around exercising.\nBut there actually are no shortcuts.\nThis is how stuff is made memorable."
p2683
aS"\nAnd I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,\nit's what E.P.,\nthe amnesic who couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem,\nleft me with,\nwhich is the notion\nthat our lives are the sum of our memories.\nHow much are we willing to lose\nfrom our already short lives\nby losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,\nby not paying attention to the human being across from us\nwho is talking with us,\nby being so lazy that we're not willing\nto process deeply?"

S'\nI want to talk a little bit today\nabout labor and work.\nWhen we think about how people work,\nthe naive intuition we have\nis that people are like rats in a maze --\nthat all people care about is money,\nand the moment we give people money,\nwe can direct them to work one way,\nwe can direct them to work another way.\nThis is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.\nAnd we really have this incredibly simplistic view\nof why people work and what the labor market looks like.'
p2703
aS'\nAt the same time, if you think about it,\nthere\'s all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.\nThink about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.\nIf you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains,\ndo you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?\nNo, they are full of misery.\nIn fact, it\'s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk\nand difficulty of breathing --\ncold, challenging circumstances.\nAnd if people were just trying to be happy,\nthe moment they would get to the top,\nthey would say, "This was a terrible mistake.\nI\'ll never do it again."\n(Laughter)\n"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."\nBut instead, people go down,\nand after they recover, they go up again.\nAnd if you think about mountain climbing as an example,\nit suggests all kinds of things.\nIt suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.\nIt suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.\nIt suggests that there\'s all kinds of other things\nthat motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways.'
p2704
aS'\nAnd for me personally, I started thinking about this\nafter a student came to visit me.\nThis was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier.\nAnd he came one day back to campus.\nAnd he told me the following story:\nHe said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation.\nHe was working in a big bank.\nThis was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.\nAnd he was working very hard on this presentation --\ngraphs, tables, information.\nHe stayed late at night every day.\nAnd the day before it was due,\nhe sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss,\nand his boss wrote him back and said,\n"Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."\nAnd the guy was deeply depressed.\nNow at the moment when he was working,\nhe was actually quite happy.\nEvery night he was enjoying his work,\nhe was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.\nBut knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed.'
p2705
aS'\nSo I started thinking about how do we experiment\nwith this idea of the fruits of our labor.\nAnd to start with, we created a little experiment\nin which we gave people Legos, and we asked them to build with Legos.\nAnd for some people, we gave them Legos and we said,\n"Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?\nWe\'ll pay you three dollars for it."\nAnd people said yes, and they built with these Legos.\nAnd when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table,\nand we said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for $2.70?"\nIf they said yes, we gave them another one.\nAnd when they finished, we asked them,\n"Do you want to build another one?" for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,\nuntil at some point people said, "No more. It\'s not worth it for me."\nThis was what we called the meaningful condition.\nPeople built one Bionicle after another.\nAfter they finished every one of them, we put them under the table.\nAnd we told them that at the end of the experiment,\nwe will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them,\nwe will put them back in the boxes, and we will use it for the next participant.'
p2706
aS'\nThere was another condition.\nThis other condition was inspired by David, my student.\nAnd this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.\nAnd if you remember the story about Sisyphus,\nSisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill,\nand when he almost got to the end,\nthe rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.\nAnd you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.\nYou can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills,\nat least he would have some sense of progress.\nAlso, if you look at prison movies,\nsometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners\nis to get them to dig a hole\nand when the prisoner is finished, they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.\nThere\'s something about this cyclical version\nof doing something over and over and over\nthat seems to be particularly demotivating.\nSo in the second condition of this experiment, that\'s exactly what we did.\nWe asked people, "Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"\nAnd if they said yes, they built it.\nThen we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"\nAnd if they said yes, we gave them a new one,\nand as they were building it,\nwe took apart the one that they just finished.\nAnd when they finished that,\nwe said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for 30 cents less?"\nAnd if they said yes, we gave them the one that they built and we broke.\nSo this was an endless cycle\nof them building and us destroying in front of their eyes.'
p2707
aS'\nNow what happens when you compare these two conditions?\nThe first thing that happened\nwas that people built many more Bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven --\nin the meaningful condition versus the Sisyphus condition.\nAnd by the way, we should point out that this was not a big meaning.\nPeople were not curing cancer or building bridges.\nPeople were building Bionicles for a few cents.\nAnd not only that, everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.\nSo there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.\nBut even the small meaning made a difference.'
p2708
aS"\nNow we had another version of this experiment.\nIn this other version of the experiment,\nwe didn't put people in this situation,\nwe just described to them the situation, much as I am describing to you now,\nand we asked them to predict what the result would be.\nWhat happened?\nPeople predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.\nPeople who were just given the description of the experiment\nsaid that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle.\nSo people understand that meaning is important,\nthey just don't understand the magnitude of the importance,\nthe extent to which it's important."
p2709
aS"\nThere was one other piece of data we looked at.\nIf you think about it, there are some people who love Legos and some people who don't.\nAnd you would speculate that the people who love Legos\nwill build more Legos, even for less money,\nbecause after all, they get more internal joy from it.\nAnd the people who love Legos less will build less Legos\nbecause the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.\nAnd that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.\nThere was a very nice correlation between love of Lego\nand the amount of Legos people built.\nWhat happened in the Sisyphic condition?\nIn that condition the correlation was zero.\nThere was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built,\nwhich suggests to me that with this manipulation\nof breaking things in front of people's eyes,\nwe basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.\nWe basically eliminated it."
p2710
aS'\nSoon after I finished running this experiment,\nI went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.\nI can\'t tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.\nAnd this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building.\nAnd they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company.\nAnd the week before I showed up,\nthe CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers,\nand canceled the project.\nAnd I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I\'ve ever talked to.\nAnd I described to them some of these Lego experiments,\nand they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.\nAnd I asked them, I said,\n"How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"\nAnd everybody raised their hand.\nI said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"\nAnd everybody raised their hand.\nI asked them, "How many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"\nAnd they didn\'t really raise their hands,\nbut they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports.\nAnd then I asked them, I said,\n"What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"\nAnd they came up with all kinds of ideas.\nThey said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company\nabout their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do.\nHe could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology\ncould fit with other parts of the organization.\nHe could have asked them to build some prototypes, some next-generation prototypes,\nand seen how they would work.\nBut the thing is that any one of those\nwould require some effort and motivation.\nAnd I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.\nIf the CEO, just like our participants,\nthought the essence of meaning is unimportant,\nthen he [wouldn\'t] care.\nAnd he would tell them, "At the moment I directed you in this way,\nand now that I am directing you in this way,\neverything will be okay."\nBut if you understood how important meaning is,\nthen you would figure out that it\'s actually important\nto spend some time, energy and effort\nin getting people to care more about what they\'re doing.'
p2711
aS'\nThe next experiment was slightly different.\nWe took a sheet of paper with random letters,\nand we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other.\nThat was the task.\nAnd people did the first sheet.\nAnd then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money\nand the next sheet for a little bit less money, and so on and so forth.\nAnd we had three conditions.\nIn the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet,\nfound all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter.\nThe experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom,\nsay "uh huh" and put it on the pile next to them.\nIn the second condition, people did not write their name on it.\nThe experimenter looked at it,\ntook the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it,\nand simply put it on the pile of pages.\nSo you take a piece, you just put it on the side.\nAnd in the third condition,\nthe experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder.\nWhat happened in those three conditions?'
p2712
aS"\nIn this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.\nSo low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer.\nIn the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way down to 15 cents.\nAt 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts.\nIn the shredder condition, it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet.\nAnd this is basically the result we had before.\nYou shred people's efforts, output,\nyou get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.\nBut I should point out, by the way,\nthat in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.\nThey could have done not so good work,\nbecause they realized that people were just shredding it.\nSo maybe the first sheet you would do good work,\nbut then you see nobody is really testing it,\nso you would do more and more and more.\nSo in fact, in the shredder condition,\npeople could have submitted more work and gotten more money\nand put less effort into it.\nBut what about the ignored condition?\nWould the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder,\nor somewhere in the middle?\nIt turns out it was almost like the shredder."
p2713
aS'\nNow there\'s good news and bad news here.\nThe bad news is that ignoring the performance of people\nis almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.\nIgnoring gets you a whole way out there.\nThe good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done,\nscanning it and saying "uh huh,"\nthat seems to be quite sufficient\nto dramatically improve people\'s motivations.\nSo the good news is that adding motivation doesn\'t seem to be so difficult.\nThe bad news is that eliminating motivations\nseems to be incredibly easy,\nand if we don\'t think about it carefully, we might overdo it.\nSo this is all in terms of negative motivation\nor eliminating negative motivation.'
p2714
aS"\nThe next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation.\nSo there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.\nAnd IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I don't know about you, but every time I assemble one of those,\nit takes me much longer, it's much more effortful, it's much more confusing.\nI put things in the wrong way.\nI can't say enjoy those pieces.\nI can't say I enjoy the process.\nBut when I finish it, I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture\nmore than I like other ones."
p2715
aS'\nAnd there\'s an old story about cake mixes.\nSo when they started cake mixes in the \'40s,\nthey would take this powder and they would put it in a box,\nand they would ask housewives to basically pour it in, stir some water in it,\nmix it, put it in the oven, and -- voila! -- you had cake.\nBut it turns out they were very unpopular.\nPeople did not want them.\nAnd they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.\nMaybe the taste was not good.\nNo, the taste was great.\nWhat they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.\nIt was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests\nand say, "Here is my cake."\nNo, no, no, it was somebody else\'s cake.\nIt was as if you bought it in the store.\nIt didn\'t really feel like your own.\nSo what did they do?\nThey took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.\n(Laughter)\nNow you had to break the eggs and add them.\nYou had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.\nNow it was your cake. Now everything was fine.'
p2716
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2717
aS"\nNow I think a little bit like the IKEA effect,\nby getting people to work harder,\nthey actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree."
p2718
aS'\nSo how do we look at this question experimentally?\nWe asked people to build some origami.\nWe gave them instructions on how to create origami,\nand we gave them a sheet of paper.\nAnd these were all novices, and they built something that was really quite ugly --\nnothing like a frog or a crane.\nBut then we told them, we said, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.\nYou worked for us, but I\'ll tell you what, we\'ll sell it to you.\nHow much do you want to pay for it?"\nAnd we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.\nAnd we had two types of people.\nWe had the people who built it,\nand we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers.\nAnd what we found was that the builders thought\nthat these were beautiful pieces of origami,\nand they were willing to pay for them five times more\nthan the people who just evaluated them externally.\nNow you could say, if you were a builder,\ndo you think that, "Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it?"\nOr do you think, "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"\nWhich one of those two is correct?\nTurns out the builders not only loved the origami more,\nthey thought that everybody would see the world in their view.\nThey thought everybody else would love it more as well.'
p2719
aS'\nIn the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect.\nWe tried to make it more difficult.\nSo for some people we gave the same task.\nFor some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions.\nAt the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami.\nFor some people we just eliminated that.\nSo now this was tougher. What happened?\nWell in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.\nNow when we looked at the easy origami,\nwe saw the same thing: Builders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.\nWhen you looked at the hard instructions,\nthe effect was larger.\nWhy? Because now the builders loved it even more.\nThey put all this extra effort into it.\nAnd evaluators? They loved it even less.\nBecause in reality it was even uglier than the first version.\nOf course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.'
p2720
aS'\nNow think about kids.\nImagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"\nYour memories and associations and so on.\nMost people would say for a lot, a lot of money --\non good days.\n(Laughter)\nBut imagine this was slightly different.\nImagine if you did not have your kids,\nand one day you went to the park and you met some kids,\nand they were just like your kids.\nAnd you played with them for a few hours.\nAnd when you were about to leave, the parents said,\n"Hey, by the way, just before you leave, if you\'re interested, they\'re for sale."\n(Laughter)\nHow much would you pay for them now?\nMost people say not that much.\nAnd this is because our kids are so valuable,\nnot just because of who they are,\nbut because of us, because they are so connected to us\nand because of the time and connection.\nAnd by the way, if you think that IKEA instructions are not good,\nthink about the instructions that come with kids.\nThose are really tough.\n(Laughter)\nBy the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.\nWhich comes to tell you one more thing,\nwhich is, much like our builders,\nwhen they look at the creature of their creation,\nwe don\'t see that other people don\'t see things our way.'
p2721
aS"\nLet me say one last comment.\nIf you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx,\nAdam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency.\nHe gave an example of a pin factory.\nHe said pins have 12 different steps,\nand if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.\nBut if you get one person to do step one\nand one person to do step two and step three and so on,\nproduction can increase tremendously.\nAnd indeed, this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.\nKarl Marx, on the other hand,\nsaid that the alienation of labor is incredibly important\nin how people think about the connection to what they are doing.\nAnd if you make all 12 steps, you care about the pin.\nBut if you make one step every time, maybe you don't care as much."
p2722
aS"\nAnd I think that in the Industrial Revolution,\nAdam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx,\nbut the reality is that we've switched\nand now we're in the knowledge economy.\nAnd you can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?\nIs efficiency still more important than meaning?\nI think the answer is no.\nI think that as we move to situations\nin which people have to decide on their own\nabout how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it,\nare they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on,\nall of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.\nSo when we think about labor, we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing,\nbut the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it --\nmeaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.\nAnd the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them,\nhow do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation,\nand how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees,\nI think we could get people to both be more productive and happier."

S"\nSo I'm going to talk about work,\nspecifically why people can't seem\nto get work done at work,\nwhich is a problem we all kind of have.\nBut let's, sort of, start at the beginning.\nSo we have companies and non-profits and charities\nand all these groups\nthat have employees\nor volunteers of some sort.\nAnd they expect these people who work for them\nto do great work --\nI would hope, at least.\nAt least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work --\nhopefully great work.\nAnd so what they typically do is they decide\nthat all these people need to come together in one place\nto do that work.\nSo a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind,\nthey typically -- unless you're working in Africa,\nif you're really lucky to do that --\nmost people have to go to an office every day.\nAnd so these companies,\nthey build offices.\nThey go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building,\nor they lease some space,\nand they fill the space with stuff.\nThey fill it with tables, or desks,\nchairs, computer equipment,\nsoftware,\nInternet access,\nmaybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,\nand they expect their employees, or their volunteers,\nto come to that location every day to do great work.\nIt seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that."
p2727
aS"\nHowever, if you actually talk to people\nand even question yourself,\nand you ask yourself,\nwhere do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?\nYou'll find out that people don't say\nwhat businesses think they would say.\nIf you ask people the question: where do you really need to go\nwhen you need to get something done?\nTypically you get three different kinds of answers.\nOne is kind of a place or a location or a room.\nAnother one is a moving object\nand a third is a time."
p2728
aS'\nSo here\'s some examples.\nWhen I ask people -- and I\'ve been asking people this question for about 10 years --\nI ask them, "Where do you go when you really need to get something done?"\nI\'ll hear things like, the porch, the deck,\nthe kitchen.\nI\'ll hear things like an extra room in the house,\nthe basement,\nthe coffee shop, the library.\nAnd then you\'ll hear things like the train,\na plane, a car -- so, the commute.\nAnd then you\'ll hear people say,\n"Well, it doesn\'t really matter where I am,\nas long as it\'s really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends."\nYou almost never hear someone say the office.\nBut businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office,\nand they\'re making people go to it all the time,\nyet people don\'t do work in the office.'

aS'\nWhat is that about?\nWhy is that?\nWhy is that happening?\nAnd what you find out is that, if you dig a little bit deeper,\nyou find out that people --\nthis is what happens --\npeople go to work,\nand they\'re basically trading in their workday\nfor a series of "work moments."\nThat\'s what happens at the office.\nYou don\'t have a workday anymore. You have work moments.\nIt\'s like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart,\nand you walk in and your day is shredded to bits,\nbecause you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there,\nand then something else happens and you\'re pulled off your work,\nand you\'ve got to do something else, then you have 20 minutes, then it\'s lunch.\nThen you have something else to do.\nThen you\'ve got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you this question,\nand before you know it, it\'s 5 p.m.,\nand you look back on the day,\nand you realize that you didn\'t get anything done.\nI mean, we\'ve all been through this.\nWe probably went through it yesterday,\nor the day before, or the day before that.\nYou look back on your day, and you\'re like, I got nothing done today.\nI was at work.\nI sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer.\nI used the software they told me to use.\nI went to these meetings I was asked to go to.\nI did these conference calls. I did all this stuff.\nBut I didn\'t actually do anything.\nI just did tasks.\nI didn\'t actually get meaningful work done.'
p2730
aS"\nAnd what you find is that, especially with creative people --\ndesigners, programmers,\nwriters, engineers,\nthinkers --\nthat people really need\nlong stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done.\nYou cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes\nand really think about a problem.\nYou might have a quick idea,\nbut to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully,\nyou need long stretches of uninterrupted time.\nAnd even though the workday is typically eight hours,\nhow many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office?\nHow about seven hours?\nSix? Five? Four?\nWhen's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?\nTwo hours? One, maybe?\nVery, very few people actually have\nlong stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.\nAnd this is why people choose to do work at home,\nor they might go to the office,\nbut they might go to the office really early in the day,\nor late at night when no one's around,\nor they stick around after everyone's left, or they go in on the weekends,\nor they get work done on the plane,\nor they get work done in the car or in the train\nbecause there are no distractions."
p2731
aS"\nNow, there are different kinds of distractions,\nbut there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions\nthat I'll talk about in just a minute.\nAnd this sort of whole phenomenon\nof having short bursts of time to get things done\nreminds me of another thing\nthat doesn't work when you're interrupted,\nand that is sleep.\nI think that sleep and work are very closely related,\nand it's not just that you can work while you're sleeping\nand you can sleep while you're working.\nThat's not really what I mean.\nI'm talking specifically about the fact\nthat sleep and work\nare phased-based,\nor stage-based, events.\nSo sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --\nsome people call them different things.\nThere's five of them,\nand in order to get to the really deep ones, the really meaningful ones,\nyou have to go through the early ones.\nAnd if you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones --\nif someone bumps you in bed,\nor if there's a sound, or whatever happens --\nyou don't just pick up where you left off."
p2732
aS"\nIf you're interrupted and woken up,\nyou have to start again.\nSo you have to go back a few phases and start again.\nAnd what ends up happening -- sometimes you might have days like this\nwhere you wake up at eight in the morning, or seven in the morning,\nor whenever you get up,\nand you're like, man, I didn't really sleep very well.\nI did the sleep thing -- I went to bed, I laid down --\nbut I didn't really sleep.\nPeople say you go to sleep,\nbut you really don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep.\nIt just takes a while. You've got to go through these phases and stuff,\nand if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.\nSo how do we expect -- does anyone here expect someone to sleep well\nif they're interrupted all night?\nI don't think anyone would say yes.\nWhy do we expect people to work well\nif they're being interrupted all day at the office?\nHow can we possibly expect people to do their job\nif they're going to the office to be interrupted?\nThat doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me."
p2733
aS'\nSo what are these interruptions that happen at the office\nthat don\'t happen at other places?\nBecause in other places, you can have interruptions,\nlike, you can have the TV,\nor you could go for a walk,\nor there\'s a fridge downstairs,\nor you\'ve got your own couch, or whatever you want to do.\nAnd if you talk to certain managers,\nthey\'ll tell you that they don\'t want their employees to work at home\nbecause of these distractions.\nThey\'ll also say --\nsometimes they\'ll also say,\n"Well, if I can\'t see the person, how do I know they\'re working?"\nwhich is ridiculous, of course, but that\'s one of the excuses that managers give.\nAnd I\'m one of these managers.\nI understand. I know how this goes.\nWe all have to improve on this sort of thing.\nBut oftentimes they\'ll cite distractions.\n"I can\'t let someone work at home.\nThey\'ll watch TV. They\'ll do this other thing."\nIt turns out that those aren\'t the things that are really distracting.\nBecause those are voluntary distractions.\nYou decide when you want to be distracted by the TV.\nYou decide when you want to turn something on.\nYou decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.\nAt the office, most of the interruptions and distractions\nthat really cause people not to get work done\nare involuntary.\nSo let\'s go through a couple of those.'
p2734
aS"\nNow, managers and bosses\nwill often have you think that the real distractions at work\nare things like Facebook and Twitter\nand YouTube and other websites,\nand in fact, they'll go so far\nas to actually ban these sites at work.\nSome of you may work at places where you can't get to these certain sites.\nI mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here?\nYou can't go to a website at work,\nand that's the problem, that's why people aren't getting work done,\nbecause they're going to Facebook and they're going to Twitter?\nThat's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy.\nAnd today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,\nthese things are just modern-day smoke breaks.\nNo one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes\n10 years ago,\nso why does everyone care about someone going to Facebook here and there,\nor Twitter here and there, or YouTube here and there?\nThose aren't the real problems in the office."
p2735
aS'\nThe real problems are what I like to call\nthe M&Ms,\nthe Managers and the Meetings.\nThose are the real problems in the modern office today.\nAnd this is why things don\'t get done at work --\nit\'s because of the M&Ms.\nNow what\'s interesting is,\nif you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work --\nlike at home, or in a car, or on a plane,\nor late at night, or early in the morning --\nyou don\'t find managers and meetings.\nYou find a lot of other distractions, but you don\'t find managers and meetings.\nSo these are the things that you don\'t find elsewhere,\nbut you do find at the office.\nAnd managers are basically people\nwhose job it is to interrupt people.\nThat\'s pretty much what managers are for. They\'re for interrupting people.\nThey don\'t really do the work,\nso they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work, which is an interruption.\nAnd we have a lot of managers in the world now,\nand there\'s a lot of people in the world now,\nand there\'s a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers.\nThey have to check in: "Hey, how\'s it going?\nShow me what\'s up," and this sort of thing\nand they keep interrupting you at the wrong time,\nwhile you\'re actually trying to do something they\'re paying you to do,\nthey tend to interrupt you.'
p2736
aS'\nThat\'s kind of bad.\nBut what\'s even worse is the thing that managers do most of all,\nwhich is call meetings.\nAnd meetings are just toxic,\nterrible, poisonous things\nduring the day at work.\nWe all know this to be true,\nand you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees.\nIt doesn\'t work that way.\nThe manager calls the meeting\nso the employees can all come together,\nand it\'s an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people --\nis to say, "Hey look,\nwe\'re going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting.\nI don\'t care what you\'re doing.\nJust, you\'ve got to stop doing what you\'re doing, so you can have this meeting."\nI mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop?\nWhat if they\'re thinking about something important?\nWhat if they\'re doing important work?\nAll of a sudden you\'re telling them that they have to stop doing that\nto do something else.\nSo they go into a meeting room, they get together,\nand they talk about stuff that doesn\'t really matter usually.\nBecause meetings aren\'t work.\nMeetings are places to go to talk about things you\'re supposed to be doing later.'
p2737
aS"\nBut meetings also procreate.\nSo one meeting tends to lead to another meeting\nand tends to lead to another meeting.\nThere's often too many people in the meetings,\nand they're very, very expensive to the organization.\nCompanies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting,\nbut that's not true, unless there's only one person in that meeting.\nIf there are 10 people in the meeting, it's a 10-hour meeting; it's not a one-hour meeting.\nIt's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization\nto have this one one-hour meeting,\nwhich probably should have been handled by two or three people\ntalking for a few minutes.\nBut instead, there's a long scheduled meeting,\nbecause meetings are scheduled the way software works,\nwhich is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour.\nYou don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook.\nYou can't. I don't even know if you can.\nYou can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.\nAnd so we tend to fill these times up\nwhen things should really go really quickly."
p2738
aS'\nSo meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today,\nespecially to offices.\nThese things don\'t exist outside of the office.\nSo I have some suggestions\nto remedy the situation.\nWhat can managers do --\nenlightened managers, hopefully --\nwhat can they do to make the office a better place for people to work,\nso it\'s not the last resort, but it\'s the first resort?\nIt\'s that people start to say,\n"When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office."\nBecause the offices are well equipped,\neverything should be there for them to do their work,\nbut they don\'t want to go there right now, so how do we change that?\nI have three suggestions I\'ll share with you guys.\nI have about three minutes, so that\'ll fit perfectly.'
p2739
aS'\nWe\'ve all heard of the casual Friday thing.\nI don\'t know if people still do that.\nBut how about "no-talk Thursdays?"\nHow about --\npick one Thursday once a month\nand cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I\'ll make it really easy for you.\nSo just the afternoon, one Thursday.\nThe first Thursday of the month -- just the afternoon --\nnobody in the office can talk to each other.\nJust silence, that\'s it.\nAnd what you\'ll find\nis that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done\nwhen no one talks to each other.\nThis is when people actually get stuff done,\nis when no one\'s bothering them, when no one\'s interrupting them.\nAnd you can give someone -- giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time\nis the best gift you can give anybody at work.\nIt\'s better than a computer.\nIt\'s better than a new monitor. It\'s better than new software,\nor whatever people typically use.\nGiving them four hours of quiet time at the office\nis going to be incredibly valuable.\nAnd if you try that, I think you\'ll find that you agree.\nAnd maybe, hopefully you can do it more often.\nSo maybe it\'s every other week,\nor every week, once a week,\nafternoons no one can talk to each other.\nThat\'s something that you\'ll find will really, really work.'
p2740
aS"\nAnother thing you can try\nis switching from active\ncommunication and collaboration,\nwhich is like face-to-face stuff,\ntapping people on the shoulder, saying hi to them, having meetings,\nand replace that with more passive models of communication,\nusing things like email and instant messaging,\nor collaboration products -- things like that.\nNow some people might say email is really distracting\nand I.M. is really distracting,\nand these other things are really distracting,\nbut they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing.\nYou can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss.\nYou can quit I.M.;\nyou can't hide your manager.\nYou can put these things away,\nand then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time,\nwhen you're available, when you're ready to go again.\nBecause work, like sleep, happens in phases.\nSo you're going to be kind of going up and doing some work,\nand then you're going to come down from that work,\nand then maybe it's time to check that email, or check that I.M.\nAnd there are very, very few things that are that urgent\nthat need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.\nSo if you're a manager,\nstart encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email\nand other things that someone else can put away\nand then get back to you on their own schedule."
p2741
aS"\nAnd the last suggestion I have\nis that, if you do have a meeting coming up,\nif you have the power,\njust cancel. Just cancel that next meeting.\nToday's Friday -- so Monday, usually people have meetings on Monday.\nJust don't have it.\nI don't mean move it;\nI mean just erase it from memory, it's gone.\nAnd you'll find out that everything will be just fine.\nAll these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make\nat this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,\njust forget about them, and things will be just fine.\nPeople have a more open morning, they can actually think,\nand you'll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do,\nyou don't actually have to do."
p2742
aS"\nSo those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys\nto think about this.\nAnd I hope that some of these ideas\nwere at least provocative enough\nfor managers and bosses and business owners\nand organizers and people who are in charge of other people\nto think about laying off a little bit\nand giving people some more time to get some work done.\nAnd I think it'll all pay off in the end."
p2743
aS'\nSo thanks for listening.'

S'\n"I felt a funeral in my brain,\nand mourners to and fro\nkept treading, treading till I felt\nthat sense was breaking through.\nAnd when they all were seated,\na service, like a drum,\nkept beating, beating, till I felt\nmy mind was going numb.\nAnd then I heard them lift a box\nand creak across my soul\nwith those same boots of lead again,\nthen space began to toll,\nas if the heavens were a bell\nand being were an ear,\nand I, and silence, some strange race\nwrecked, solitary, here.\nJust then, a plank in reason broke,\nand I fell down and down\nand hit a world at every plunge,\nand finished knowing then."'
p2747
aS'\nWe know depression through metaphors.\nEmily Dickinson was able to convey it in language,\nGoya in an image.\nHalf the purpose of art\nis to describe such iconic states.'
p2748
aS"\nAs for me, I had always thought myself tough,\none of the people who could survive\nif I'd been sent to a concentration camp."
p2749
aS"\nIn 1991, I had a series of losses.\nMy mother died,\na relationship I'd been in ended,\nI moved back to the United States\nfrom some years abroad,\nand I got through all of those experiences intact."
p2750
aS'\nBut in 1994, three years later,\nI found myself losing interest in almost everything.\nI didn\'t want to do any of the things\nI had previously wanted to do,\nand I didn\'t know why.\nThe opposite of depression\nis not happiness, but vitality,\nand it was vitality\nthat seemed to seep away from me in that moment.\nEverything there was to do\nseemed like too much work.\nI would come home\nand I would see the red light\nflashing on my answering machine,\nand instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends,\nI would think,\n"What a lot of people that is to have to call back."\nOr I would decide I should have lunch,\nand then I would think, but\nI\'d have to get the food out\nand put it on a plate\nand cut it up and chew it and swallow it,\nand it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.'
p2751
aS"\nAnd one of the things that often gets lost\nin discussions of depression\nis that you know it's ridiculous.\nYou know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it.\nYou know that most people manage\nto listen to their messages and eat lunch\nand organize themselves to take a shower\nand go out the front door\nand that it's not a big deal,\nand yet you are nonetheless in its grip\nand you are unable to figure out any way around it.\nAnd so I began to feel myself doing less\nand thinking less\nand feeling less.\nIt was a kind of nullity."
p2752
aS'\nAnd then the anxiety set in.\nIf you told me that I\'d have to be\ndepressed for the next month,\nI would say, "As long I know it\'ll be\nover in November, I can do it."\nBut if you said to me,\n"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"\nI would rather slit my wrist than go through it.\nIt was the feeling all the time\nlike that feeling you have if you\'re walking\nand you slip or trip\nand the ground is rushing up at you,\nbut instead of lasting half a\nsecond, the way that does,\nit lasted for six months.\nIt\'s a sensation of being afraid all the time\nbut not even knowing what it is that you\'re afraid of.\nAnd it was at that point that I began to think\nthat it was just too painful to be alive,\nand that the only reason not to kill oneself\nwas so as not to hurt other people.'
p2753
aS'\nAnd finally one day, I woke up\nand I thought perhaps I\'d had a stroke,\nbecause I lay in bed completely frozen,\nlooking at the telephone, thinking,\n"Something is wrong and I should call for help,"\nand I couldn\'t reach out my arm\nand pick up the phone and dial.\nAnd finally, after four full hours\nof my lying and staring at it,\nthe phone rang,\nand somehow I managed to pick it up,\nand it was my father,\nand I said, "I\'m in serious trouble.\nWe need to do something."'
p2754
aS"\nThe next day I started with the medications\nand the therapy.\nAnd I also started reckoning\nwith this terrible question:\nIf I'm not the tough person\nwho could have made it\nthrough a concentration camp,\nthen who am I?\nAnd if I have to take medication,\nis that medication making me more fully myself,\nor is it making me someone else?\nAnd how do I feel about it\nif it's making me someone else?"
p2755
aS'\nI had two advantages as I went in to the fight.\nThe first is that I knew that, objectively speaking,\nI had a nice life,\nand that if I could only get well,\nthere was something at the other end\nthat was worth living for.\nAnd the other was that I had\naccess to good treatment.'
p2756
aS'\nBut I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,\nand emerged and relapsed,\nand emerged and relapsed,\nand finally understood\nI would have to be on medication\nand in therapy forever.\nAnd I thought, "But is it a chemical problem\nor a psychological problem?\nAnd does it need a chemical cure\nor a philosophical cure?"\nAnd I couldn\'t figure out which it was.\nAnd then I understood that actually,\nwe aren\'t advanced enough in either area\nfor it to explain things fully.\nThe chemical cure and the psychological cure\nboth have a role to play,\nand I also figured out that depression was something\nthat was braided so deep into us\nthat there was no separating it\nfrom our character and personality.'
p2757
aS"\nI want to say that the treatments we have\nfor depression are appalling.\nThey're not very effective.\nThey're extremely costly.\nThey come with innumerable side effects.\nThey're a disaster.\nBut I am so grateful that I live now\nand not 50 years ago,\nwhen there would have been almost nothing\nto be done.\nI hope that 50 years hence,\npeople will hear about my treatments\nand be appalled that anyone endured\nsuch primitive science."
p2758
aS'\nDepression is the flaw in love.\nIf you were married to someone and thought,\n"Well, if my wife dies, I\'ll find another one,"\nit wouldn\'t be love as we know it.\nThere\'s no such thing as love\nwithout the anticipation of loss,\nand that specter of despair\ncan be the engine of intimacy.'
p2759
aS"\nThere are three things people tend to confuse:\ndepression, grief and sadness.\nGrief is explicitly reactive.\nIf you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy,\nand then, six months later,\nyou are still deeply sad, but\nyou're functioning a little better,\nit's probably grief,\nand it will probably ultimately resolve itself\nin some measure.\nIf you experience a catastrophic loss,\nand you feel terrible,\nand six months later you can barely function at all,\nthen it's probably a depression that was triggered\nby the catastrophic circumstances.\nThe trajectory tells us a great deal.\nPeople think of depression as being just sadness.\nIt's much, much too much sadness,\nmuch too much grief\nat far too slight a cause."
p2760
aS'\nAs I set out to understand depression,\nand to interview people who had experienced it,\nI found that there were people who seemed\non the surface to have what sounded like\nrelatively mild depression\nwho were nonetheless utterly disabled by it.\nAnd there were other people who had what sounded\nas they described it\nlike terribly severe depression\nwho nonetheless had good lives in the interstices\nbetween their depressive episodes.\nAnd I set out to find out what it is\nthat causes some people\nto be more resilient than other people.\nWhat are the mechanisms\nthat allow people to survive?\nAnd I went out and I interviewed person after person\nwho was suffering with depression.'
p2761
aS"\nOne of the first people I interviewed\ndescribed depression\nas a slower way of being dead,\nand that was a good thing for me to hear early on\nbecause it reminded me\nthat that slow way of being dead\ncan lead to actual deadness,\nthat this is a serious business.\nIt's the leading disability worldwide,\nand people die of it every day."
p2762
aS'\nOne of the people I talked to\nwhen I was trying to understand this\nwas a beloved friend\nwho I had known for many years,\nand who had had a psychotic episode\nin her freshman year of college,\nand then plummeted into a horrific depression.\nShe had bipolar illness,\nor manic depression, as it was then known.\nAnd then she did very well\nfor many years on lithium,\nand then eventually,\nshe was taken off her lithium\nto see how she would do without it,\nand she had another psychosis,\nand then plunged into the worst depression\nthat I had ever seen\nin which she sat in her parents\' apartment,\nmore or less catatonic, essentially without moving,\nday after day after day.\nAnd when I interviewed her about\nthat experience some years later --\nshe\'s a poet and psychotherapist\nnamed Maggie Robbins \nwhen I interviewed her, she said,\n"I was singing \'Where Have All The Flowers Gone\'\nover and over to occupy my mind.\nI was singing to blot out the\nthings my mind was saying,\nwhich were, \'You are nothing. You are nobody.\nYou don\'t even deserve to live.\'\nAnd that was when I really started thinking\nabout killing myself."'
p2763
aS"\nYou don't think in depression\nthat you've put on a gray veil\nand are seeing the world through the haze\nof a bad mood.\nYou think that the veil has been taken away,\nthe veil of happiness,\nand that now you're seeing truly.\nIt's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive\nthat there's something foreign inside of them\nthat needs to be exorcised,\nbut it's difficult with depressives,\nbecause we believe we are seeing the truth."
p2764
aS'\nBut the truth lies.\nI became obsessed with that sentence:\n"But the truth lies."\nAnd I discovered, as I talked to depressive people,\nthat they have many delusional perceptions.\nPeople will say, "No one loves me."\nAnd you say, "I love you,\nyour wife loves you, your mother loves you."\nYou can answer that one pretty readily,\nat least for most people.\nBut people who are depressed will also say,\n"No matter what we do,\nwe\'re all just going to die in the end."\nOr they\'ll say, "There can be no true communion\nbetween two human beings.\nEach of us is trapped in his own body."\nTo which you have to say,\n"That\'s true,\nbut I think we should focus right now\non what to have for breakfast."\n(Laughter)\nA lot of the time,\nwhat they are expressing is not illness, but insight,\nand one comes to think what\'s really extraordinary\nis that most of us know about\nthose existential questions\nand they don\'t distract us very much.\nThere was a study I particularly liked\nin which a group of depressed\nand a group of non-depressed people\nwere asked to play a video game for an hour,\nand at the end of the hour,\nthey were asked how many little monsters\nthey thought they had killed.\nThe depressive group was usually accurate\nto within about 10 percent,\nand the non-depressed people\nguessed between 15 and 20 times as many\nlittle monsters  (Laughter) \nas they had actually killed.'
p2765
aS'\nA lot of people said, when I chose\nto write about my depression,\nthat it must be very difficult\nto be out of that closet, to have people know.\nThey said, "Do people talk to you differently?"\nAnd I said, "Yes, people talk to me differently.\nThey talk to me differently insofar\nas they start telling me about their experience,\nor their sister\'s experience,\nor their friend\'s experience.\nThings are different because now I know\nthat depression is the family secret\nthat everyone has.'
p2766
aS'\nI went a few years ago to a conference,\nand on Friday of the three-day conference,\none of the participants took me aside, and she said,\n"I suffer from depression and\nI\'m a little embarrassed about it,\nbut I\'ve been taking this medication,\nand I just wanted to ask you what you think?"\nAnd so I did my best to give\nher such advice as I could.\nAnd then she said, "You know,\nmy husband would never understand this.\nHe\'s really the kind of guy to whom\nthis wouldn\'t make any sense,\nso I just, you know, it\'s just between us."\nAnd I said, "Yes, that\'s fine."\nOn Sunday of the same conference,\nher husband took me aside,\nand he said, "My wife wouldn\'t think\nthat I was really much of a guy if she knew this,\nbut I\'ve been dealing with this depression\nand I\'m taking some medication,\nand I wondered what you think?"\nThey were hiding\nthe same medication in two different places\nin the same bedroom.\nAnd I said that I thought\ncommunication within the marriage\nmight be triggering some of their problems.\n(Laughter)\nBut I was also struck\nby the burdensome nature\nof such mutual secrecy.\nDepression is so exhausting.\nIt takes up so much of your time and energy,\nand silence about it,\nit really does make the depression worse.'
p2767
aS"\nAnd then I began thinking about all the ways\npeople make themselves better.\nI'd started off as a medical conservative.\nI thought there were a few\nkinds of therapy that worked,\nit was clear what they were --\nthere was medication,\nthere were certain psychotherapies,\nthere was possibly electroconvulsive treatment,\nand that everything else was nonsense.\nBut then I discovered something.\nIf you have brain cancer,\nand you say that standing on your head\nfor 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better,\nit may make you feel better,\nbut you still have brain cancer,\nand you'll still probably die from it.\nBut if you say that you have depression,\nand standing on your head for 20 minutes every day\nmakes you feel better, then it's worked,\nbecause depression is an illness of how you feel,\nand if you feel better,\nthen you are effectively not depressed anymore.\nSo I became much more tolerant\nof the vast world of alternative treatments."
p2768
aS"\nAnd I get letters, I get hundreds of letters\nfrom people writing to tell me\nabout what's worked for them.\nSomeone was asking me backstage today\nabout meditation.\nMy favorite of the letters that I got\nwas the one that came from a woman\nwho wrote and said that she had tried therapy,\nshe had tried medication,\nshe had tried pretty much everything,\nand she had found a solution\nand hoped I would tell the world,\nand that was making little things from yarn.\n(Laughter)\nShe sent me some of them. (Laughter)\nAnd I'm not wearing them right now.\nI suggested to her that she also should look up\nobsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM."

aS'\nAnd yet, when I went to look\nat alternative treatments,\nI also gained perspective on other treatments.\nI went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal\nthat involved a great deal of ram\'s blood\nand that I\'m not going to detail right now,\nbut a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda\nworking on a different project,\nand I happened to describe\nmy experience to someone,\nand he said, "Well, you know,\nthat\'s West Africa, and we\'re in East Africa,\nand our rituals are in some ways very different,\nbut we do have some rituals that have something\nin common with what you\'re describing."\nAnd I said, "Oh." And he said, "Yes," he said,\n"but we\'ve had a lot of trouble with\nWestern mental health workers,\nespecially the ones who came\nright after the genocide."\nAnd I said, "What kind of trouble did you have?"\nAnd he said, "Well,\nthey would do this bizarre thing.\nThey didn\'t take people out in the sunshine\nwhere you begin to feel better.\nThey didn\'t include drumming or music\nto get people\'s blood going.\nThey didn\'t involve the whole community.\nThey didn\'t externalize the depression\nas an invasive spirit.\nInstead what they did was they took people\none at a time into dingy little rooms\nand had them talk for an hour\nabout bad things that had happened to them."\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nHe said, "We had to ask them to leave the country."\n(Laughter)'
p2770
aS'\nNow at the other end of alternative treatments,\nlet me tell you about Frank Russakoff.\nFrank Russakoff had the worst depression\nperhaps that I\'ve ever seen in a man.\nHe was constantly depressed.\nHe was, when I met him, at a point at which\nevery month he would have electroshock treatment.\nThen he would feel sort of disoriented for a week.\nThen he would feel okay for a week.\nThen he would have a week of going downhill.\nAnd then he would have another\nelectroshock treatment.\nAnd he said to me when I met him,\n"It\'s unbearable to go through my weeks this way.\nI can\'t go on this way,\nand I\'ve figured out how I\'m going to end it\nif I don\'t get better.\nBut," he said to me, "I heard about a protocol\nat Mass General for a procedure called\na cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery,\nand I think I\'m going to give that a try."\nAnd I remember being amazed at that point\nto think that someone\nwho clearly had so many bad experiences\nwith so many different treatments\nstill had buried in him somewhere enough optimism\nto reach out for one more.\nAnd he had the cingulotomy,\nand it was incredibly successful.\nHe\'s now a friend of mine.\nHe has a lovely wife and two beautiful children.\nHe wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery,\nand he said,\n"My father sent me two presents this year,\nFirst, a motorized C.D. rack from The Sharper Image\nthat I didn\'t really need,\nbut I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate\nthe fact that I\'m living on my own\nand have a job I seem to love.\nAnd the other present\nwas a photo of my grandmother,\nwho committed suicide.\nAs I unwrapped it, I began to cry,\nand my mother came over and said,\n\'Are you crying because of the\nrelatives you never knew?\'\nAnd I said, \'She had the same disease I have.\'\nI\'m crying now as I write to you.\nIt\'s not that I\'m so sad, but I get overwhelmed,\nI think, because I could have killed myself,\nbut my parents kept me going,\nand so did the doctors,\nand I had the surgery.\nI\'m alive and grateful.\nWe live in the right time,\neven if it doesn\'t always feel like it."'
p2771
aS'\nI was struck by the fact that depression\nis broadly perceived to be\na modern, Western, middle-class thing,\nand I went to look at how it operated\nin a variety of other contexts,\nand one of the things I was most interested in\nwas depression among the indigent.\nAnd so I went out to try to look at\nwhat was being done for \npoor people with depression.\nAnd what I discovered is that poor people\nare mostly not being treated for depression.\nDepression is the result of a genetic vulnerability,\nwhich is presumably evenly\ndistributed in the population,\nand triggering circumstances,\nwhich are likely to be more severe\nfor people who are impoverished.\nAnd yet it turns out that if you have\na really lovely life but feel miserable all the time,\nyou think, "Why do I feel like this?\nI must have depression."\nAnd you set out to find treatment for it.\nBut if you have a perfectly awful life,\nand you feel miserable all the time,\nthe way you feel is commensurate with your life,\nand it doesn\'t occur to you to think,\n"Maybe this is treatable."\nAnd so we have an epidemic in this country\nof depression among impoverished people\nthat\'s not being picked up\nand that\'s not being treated\nand that\'s not being addressed,\nand it\'s a tragedy of a grand order.\nAnd so I found an academic\nwho was doing a research project\nin slums outside of D.C.,\nwhere she picked up women who had\ncome in for other health problems\nand diagnosed them with depression,\nand then provided six months\nof the experimental protocol.\nOne of them, Lolly, came in,\nand this is what she said the day she came in.\nShe said, and she was a woman, by the way,\nwho had seven children. She said,\n"I used to have a job but I had to give it up because\nI couldn\'t go out of the house.\nI have nothing to say to my children.\nIn the morning, I can\'t wait for them to leave,\nand then I climb in bed and\npull the covers over my head,\nand three o\'clock when they come home,\nit just comes so fast."\nShe said, "I\'ve been taking a lot of Tylenol,\nanything I can take so that I can sleep more.\nMy husband has been telling me I\'m stupid, I\'m ugly.\nI wish I could stop the pain."'
p2772
aS'\nWell, she was brought into\nthis experimental protocol,\nand when I interviewed her six months later,\nshe had taken a job working in childcare\nfor the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband,\nand she said to me,\n"My kids are so much happier now."\nShe said, "There\'s one room in my new place\nfor the boys and one room for the girls,\nbut at night, they\'re just all up on my bed,\nand we\'re doing homework\nall together and everything.\nOne of them wants to be a preacher,\none of them wants to be a firefighter,\nand one of the girls says she\'s going to be a lawyer.\nThey don\'t cry like they used to,\nand they don\'t fight like they did.\nThat\'s all I need now is my kids.\nThings keep on changing,\nthe way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act.\nI can go outside not being afraid anymore,\nand I don\'t think those bad feelings are coming back,\nand if it weren\'t for Dr. Miranda and that,\nI would still be at home with\nthe covers pulled over my head,\nif I were still alive at all.\nI asked the Lord to send me an angel,\nand he heard my prayers."'
p2773
aS'\nI was really moved by these experiences,\nand I decided that I wanted to write about them\nnot only in a book I was working on,\nbut also in an article,\nand so I got a commission from\nThe New York Times Magazine\nto write about depression among the indigent.'
p2774
aS'\nAnd I turned in my story,\nand my editor called me and said,\n"We really can\'t publish this."'
p2775
aS'\nAnd I said, "Why not?"'
p2776
aS'\nAnd she said, "It just is too far-fetched.\nThese people who are sort of at\nthe very bottom rung of society\nand then they get a few months of treatment\nand they\'re virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley?\nIt\'s just too implausible."\nShe said, I\'ve never even heard of anything like it."'
p2777
aS'\nAnd I said, "The fact that you\'ve never heard of it\nis an indication that it is news."\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n"And you are a news magazine."'
p2778
aS"\nSo after a certain amount of negotiation,\nthey agreed to it.\nBut I think a lot of what they said\nwas connected in some strange way\nto this distaste that people still have\nfor the idea of treatment,\nthe notion that somehow if we went out\nand treated a lot of people in indigent communities,\nthat would be an exploitative thing to do,\nbecause we would be changing them.\nThere is this false moral imperative\nthat seems to be all around us\nthat treatment of depression,\nthe medications and so on, are an artifice,\nand that it's not natural.\nAnd I think that's very misguided.\nIt would be natural for people's teeth to fall out,\nbut there is nobody militating against toothpaste,\nat least not in my circles."
p2779
aS'\nAnd people then say, "Well, but isn\'t depression\npart of what people are supposed to experience?\nDidn\'t we evolve to have depression?\nIsn\'t it part of your personality?"\nTo which I would say, mood is adaptive.\nBeing able to have sadness and fear\nand joy and pleasure\nand all of the other moods that we have,\nthat\'s incredibly valuable.\nAnd major depression is something that happens\nwhen that system gets broken.\nIt\'s maladaptive.'
p2780
aS'\nPeople will come to me and say,\n"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year,\nI think I can just get through this."'
p2781
aS'\nAnd I always say to them, "You may get through it,\nbut you\'ll never be 37 again.\nLife is short, and that\'s a whole year\nyou\'re talking about giving up.\nThink it through."'
p2782
aS"\nIt's a strange poverty of the English language,\nand indeed of many other languages,\nthat we use this same word, depression,\nto describe how a kid feels\nwhen it rains on his birthday,\nand to describe how somebody feels\nthe minute before they commit suicide."
p2783
aS'\nPeople say to me, "Well, is it\ncontinuous with normal sadness?"\nAnd I say, in a way it\'s continuous\nwith normal sadness.\nThere is a certain amount of continuity,\nbut it\'s the same way there\'s continuity\nbetween having an iron fence outside your house\nthat gets a little rust spot\nthat you have to sand off and do a little repainting,\nand what happens if you leave\nthe house for 100 years\nand it rusts through until it\'s only a pile\nof orange dust.\nAnd it\'s that orange dust spot,\nthat orange dust problem,\nthat\'s the one we\'re setting out to address.'
p2784
aS'\nSo now people say,\n"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"\nAnd I don\'t.\nBut I don\'t feel sad about having to eat lunch,\nand I don\'t feel sad about my answering machine,\nand I don\'t feel sad about taking a shower.\nI feel more, in fact, I think,\nbecause I can feel sadness without nullity.\nI feel sad about professional disappointments,\nabout damaged relationships,\nabout global warming.\nThose are the things that I feel sad about now.\nAnd I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion?\nHow did those people who have better lives\neven with bigger depression manage to get through?\nWhat is the mechanism of resilience?\nAnd what I came up with over time\nwas that the people who deny their experience,\nthe ones who say, "I was depressed a long time ago\nand I never want to think about it again\nand I\'m not going to look at it\nand I\'m just going to get on with my life,"\nironically, those are the people\nwho are most enslaved by what they have.\nShutting out the depression strengthens it.\nWhile you hide from it, it grows.\nAnd the people who do better\nare the ones who are able to tolerate the fact\nthat they have this condition.\nThose who can tolerate their depression\nare the ones who achieve resilience.'
p2785
aS'\nSo Frank Russakoff said to me,\n"If I had it again to do over,\nI suppose I wouldn\'t do it this way,\nbut in a strange way, I\'m grateful\nfor what I\'ve experienced.\nI\'m glad to have been in the hospital 40 times.\nIt taught me so much about love,\nand my relationship with my parents and my doctors\nhas been so precious to me, and will be always."'
p2786
aS'\nAnd Maggie Robbins said,\n"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,\nand I would just talk and talk and talk,\nand the people I was dealing with\nweren\'t very responsive, and I thought,\n\'That\'s not very friendly or helpful of them.\'\nAnd then I realized,\nI realized that they weren\'t going to do more\nthan make those first few minutes of small talk.\nIt was simply going to be an occasion\nwhere I didn\'t have AIDS and I wasn\'t dying,\nbut could tolerate the fact that they did\nand they were.\nOur needs are our greatest assets.\nIt turns out I\'ve learned to give\nall the things I need."'
p2787
aS'\nValuing one\'s depression\ndoes not prevent a relapse,\nbut it may make the prospect of relapse\nand even relapse itself easier to tolerate.\nThe question is not so much\nof finding great meaning and deciding\nyour depression has been very meaningful.\nIt\'s of seeking that meaning\nand thinking, when it comes again,\n"This will be hellish,\nbut I will learn something from it."\nI have learned in my own depression\nhow big an emotion can be,\nhow it can be more real than facts,\nand I have found that that experience\nhas allowed me to experience positive emotion\nin a more intense and more focused way.\nThe opposite of depression is not happiness,\nbut vitality,\nand these days, my life is vital,\neven on the days when I\'m sad.\nI felt that funeral in my brain,\nand I sat next to the colossus\nat the edge of the world,\nand I have discovered\nsomething inside of myself\nthat I would have to call a soul\nthat I had never formulated\nuntil that day 20 years ago\nwhen hell came to pay me a surprise visit.\nI think that while I hated being depressed\nand would hate to be depressed again,\nI\'ve found a way to love my depression.\nI love it because it has forced me\nto find and cling to joy.\nI love it because each day I decide,\nsometimes gamely,\nand sometimes against the moment\'s reason,\nto cleave to the reasons for living.\nAnd that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.'

S"\nI'd like to take you to another world.\nAnd I'd like to share\na 45 year-old love story\nwith the poor,\nliving on less than one dollar a day.\nI went to a very elitist, snobbish,\nexpensive education in India,\nand that almost destroyed me.\nI was all set\nto be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --\nall laid out.\nThen, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion\nfor three years.\n(Laughter)\nThe whole world was laid out for me.\nEverything was at my feet.\nI could do nothing wrong.\nAnd then I thought out of curiosity\nI'd like to go and live and work\nand just see what a village is like."
p2792
aS'\nSo in 1965,\nI went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,\nand I saw starvation, death,\npeople dying of hunger, for the first time.\nIt changed my life.\nI came back home,\ntold my mother,\n"I\'d like to live and work in a village."\nMother went into a coma.\n(Laughter)\n"What is this?\nThe whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,\nand you want to go and work in a village?\nI mean, is there something wrong with you?"\nI said, "No, I\'ve got the best eduction.\nIt made me think.\nAnd I wanted to give something back\nin my own way."\n"What do you want to do in a village?\nNo job, no money,\nno security, no prospect."\nI said, "I want to live\nand dig wells for five years."\n"Dig wells for five years?\nYou went to the most expensive school and college in India,\nand you want to dig wells for five years?"\nShe didn\'t speak to me for a very long time,\nbecause she thought I\'d let my family down.'
p2793
aS'\nBut then,\nI was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills\nthat very poor people have,\nwhich are never brought into the mainstream --\nwhich is never identified, respected,\napplied on a large scale.\nAnd I thought I\'d start a Barefoot College --\ncollege only for the poor.\nWhat the poor thought was important\nwould be reflected in the college.\nI went to this village for the first time.\nElders came to me\nand said, "Are you running from the police?"\nI said, "No."\n(Laughter)\n"You failed in your exam?"\nI said, "No."\n"You didn\'t get a government job?" I said, "No."\n"What are you doing here?\nWhy are you here?\nThe education system in India\nmakes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;\nwhat are you doing in this village?\nIs there something wrong with you you\'re not telling us?"\nI said, "No, I want to actually start a college\nonly for the poor.\nWhat the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."'
p2794
aS'\nSo the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.\nThey said, "Please,\ndon\'t bring anyone with a degree and qualification\ninto your college."\nSo it\'s the only college in India\nwhere, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master\'s,\nyou are disqualified to come.\nYou have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout\nto come to our college.\nYou have to work with your hands.\nYou have to have a dignity of labor.\nYou have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community\nand provide a service to the community.\nSo we started the Barefoot College,\nand we redefined professionalism.'
p2795
aS'\nWho is a professional?\nA professional is someone\nwho has a combination of competence,\nconfidence and belief.\nA water diviner is a professional.\nA traditional midwife\nis a professional.\nA traditional bone setter is a professional.\nThese are professionals all over the world.\nYou find them in any inaccessible village around the world.\nAnd we thought that these people should come into the mainstream\nand show that the knowledge and skills that they have\nis universal.\nIt needs to be used, needs to be applied,\nneeds to be shown to the world outside --\nthat these knowledge and skills\nare relevant even today.'
p2796
aS"\nSo the college works\nfollowing the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.\nYou eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.\nThere are no contracts, no written contracts.\nYou can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.\nAnd no one can get more than $100 a month.\nYou come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.\nYou come for the work and the challenge,\nyou'll come to the Barefoot College.\nThat is where we want you to try crazy ideas.\nWhatever idea you have, come and try it.\nIt doesn't matter if you fail.\nBattered, bruised, you start again.\nIt's the only college where the teacher is the learner\nand the learner is the teacher.\nAnd it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.\nYou are certified by the community you serve.\nYou don't need a paper to hang on the wall\nto show that you are an engineer."
p2797
aS'\nSo when I said that,\nthey said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?\nThis is all mumbo-jumbo if you can\'t show it on the ground."\nSo we built the first Barefoot College\nin 1986.\nIt was built by 12 Barefoot architects\nwho can\'t read and write,\nbuilt on $1.50 a sq. ft.\n150 people lived there, worked there.\nThey got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.\nBut then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.\nI said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,\nbut the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."\nWe are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,\nbecause they didn\'t believe us,\nand we thought that they were actually casting aspersions\non the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.'
p2798
aS'\nI asked a forester --\nhigh-powered, paper-qualified expert --\nI said, "What can you build in this place?"\nHe had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.\nNot even worth it.\nNo water, rocky soil."\nI was in a bit of a spot.\nAnd I said, "Okay, I\'ll go to the old man in village\nand say, \'What should I grow in this spot?\'"\nHe looked quietly at me and said,\n"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it\'ll work."\nThis is what it looks like today.'
p2799
aS'\nWent to the roof,\nand all the women said, "Clear out.\nThe men should clear out because we don\'t want to share this technology with the men.\nThis is waterproofing the roof."\n(Laughter)\nIt is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens\nand a bit of other things I don\'t know.\nBut it actually doesn\'t leak.\nSince 1986, it hasn\'t leaked.\nThis technology, the women will not share with the men.'

p2804
aS"\n60 percent of children don't go to school,\nbecause they have to look after animals --\nsheep, goats --\ndomestic chores.\nSo we thought of starting a school\nat night for the children.\nBecause the night schools of Tilonia,\nover 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.\nBecause it's for the convenience of the child;\nit's not for the convenience of the teacher.\nAnd what do we teach in these schools?\nDemocracy, citizenship,\nhow you should measure your land,\nwhat you should do if you're arrested,\nwhat you should do if your animal is sick.\nThis is what we teach in the night schools.\nBut all the schools are solar-lit."

S"\nGood afternoon.\nThere's a medical revolution happening all around us,\nand it's one that's going to help us conquer\nsome of society's most dreaded conditions,\nincluding cancer.\nThe revolution is called angiogenesis,\nand it's based on the process\nthat our bodies use to grow blood vessels."
p2828
aS"\nSo why should we care about blood vessels?\nWell, the human body is literally packed with them:\n60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.\nEnd to end, that would form a line\nthat would circle the earth twice.\nThe smallest blood vessels are called capillaries;\nwe've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.\nAnd these are the vessels of life, and,\nas I'll show you,\nthey can also be the vessels of death.\nNow the remarkable thing about blood vessels\nis that they have this ability\nto adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.\nFor example, in the liver they form channels\nto detoxify the blood;\nin the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange;\nin muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract\nwithout cutting off circulation;\nand in nerves they course along like power lines,\nkeeping those nerves alive.\nWe get most of these blood vessels\nwhen we're actually still in the womb,\nAnd what that means is that as adults,\nblood vessels don't normally grow.\nExcept in a few special circumstances:\nIn women, blood vessels grow every month\nto build the lining of the uterus;\nduring pregnancy, they form the placenta,\nwhich connects mom and baby.\nAnd after injury, blood vessels\nactually have to grow under the scab\nin order to heal a wound.\nAnd this is actually what it looks like,\nhundreds of blood vessels\nall growing toward the center of the wound."
p2829
aS'\nSo the body has the ability to regulate\nthe amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.\nIt does this through an elaborate\nand elegant system of checks and balances,\nstimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,\nsuch that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,\nthe body can do this by releasing stimulators,\nproteins called angiogenic factors\nthat act as natural fertilizer\nand stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.\nAnd when those excess vessels are no longer needed,\nthe body prunes them back to baseline\nusing naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.\nNow there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline\nand we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels --\nfor example, after an injury --\nand a body can do that too,\nbut only to that normal level,\nthat set point.'
p2830
aS"\nBut what we now know is that for a number of diseases,\nthere are defects in the system\nwhere the body can't prune back extra blood vessels\nor can't grow enough new ones\nin the right place at the right time.\nAnd in these situations, angiogenesis\nis out of balance.\nAnd when angiogenesis is out of balance,\na myriad of diseases result.\nFor example, insufficient angiogenesis --\nnot enough blood vessels --\nleads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,\nlegs without circulation, death from stroke,\nnerve damage.\nAnd on the other end, excessive angiogenesis --\ntoo many blood vessels -- drives disease,\nand we see this in cancer, blindness,\narthritis, obesity,\nAlzheimer's disease.\nIn total, there are more than 70 major diseases\naffecting more than a billion people worldwide,\nthat all look on the surface to be different from one another,\nbut all actually share\nabnormal angiogenesis\nas their common denominator.\nAnd this realization is allowing us\nto reconceptualize\nthe way that we actually approach these diseases\nby controlling angiogenesis."
p2831
aS"\nNow I'm going to focus on cancer\nbecause angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer,\nevery type of cancer.\nSo here we go.\nThis is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass\ngrowing inside a brain.\nAnd under the microscope, you can see\nhundreds of these brown staining blood vessels,\ncapillaries that are feeding cancer cells,\nbringing oxygen and nutrients.\nBut cancers don't start out like this.\nAnd, in fact, cancers don't start out\nwith a blood supply.\nThey start out as small, microscopic nests of cells\nthat can only grow to\none half a cubic millimeter in size;\nthat's the tip of a ballpoint pen.\nThen they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,\nso they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients."
p2832
aS'\nIn fact, we\'re probably forming these\nmicroscopic cancers all the time in our body.\nAutopsy studies from people who died in car accidents\nhave shown that about 40 percent of women\nbetween the ages of 40 and 50\nactually have microscopic\ncancers in their breasts,\nabout 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s\nhave microscopic prostate cancers,\nand virtually 100 percent of us,\nby the time we reach our 70s,\nwill have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.\nYet, without a blood supply,\nmost of these cancers\nwill never become dangerous.\nDr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor\nand who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,\nonce called this "cancer without disease."'
p2833
aS"\nSo the body's ability to balance angiogenesis,\nwhen it's working properly,\nprevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.\nAnd this turns out to be\none of our most important defense mechanisms\nagainst cancer.\nIn fact, if you actually block angiogenesis\nand prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,\ntumors simply can't grow up.\nBut once angiogenesis occurs,\ncancers can grow exponentially.\nAnd this is actually how\na cancer goes from being\nharmless to deadly.\nCancer cells mutate\nand they gain the ability to release\nlots of those angiogenic factors, natural fertilizer,\nthat tip the balance in favor of blood vessels\ninvading the cancer.\nAnd once those vessels invade the cancer,\nit can expand, it can invade local tissues.\nAnd the same vessels that are feeding tumors\nallow cancer cells to exit into the circulation\nas metastases.\nAnd, unfortunately, this late stage of cancer\nis the one at which it's most likely\nto be diagnosed,\nwhen angiogenesis is already turned on\nand cancer cells are growing like wild."
p2834
aS"\nSo, if angiogenesis\nis a tipping point\nbetween a harmless cancer and a harmful one,\nthen one major part of the angiogenesis revolution\nis a new approach to treating cancer\nby cutting off the blood supply.\nWe call this antiangiogenic therapy,\nand it's completely different from chemotherapy\nbecause it selectively aims\nat the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.\nAnd we can do this because\ntumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels\nwe see in other places of the body:\nThey're abnormal;\nthey're very poorly constructed;\nand, because of that, they're highly vulnerable\nto treatments that target them.\nIn effect, when we give cancer patients\nantiangiogenic therapy --\nhere, an experimental drug for a glioma,\nwhich is a type of brain tumor --\nyou can see that there are dramatic changes that occur\nwhen the tumor is being starved.\nHere's a woman with a breast cancer\nbeing treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,\nwhich is FDA approved.\nAnd you can see that the halo of blood flow\ndisappears after treatment."
p2835
aS'\nWell, I\'ve just shown you\ntwo very different types of cancer\nthat both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.\nSo, a few years ago, I asked myself,\n"Can we take this one step further\nand treat other cancers,\neven in other species?"\nSo here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo\nwho had a very aggressive tumor\ncalled a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.\nIt invaded into his lungs.\nHis veterinarian only gave him three months to live.\nSo we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs\nthat could be mixed into his dog food\nas well as an antiangiogenic cream\nthat could be applied on the surface of the tumor.\nAnd within a few weeks of treatment,\nwe were able to slow down that cancer\'s growth\nsuch that we were ultimately able to extend milo\'s survival\nto six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,\nall with a very good quality of life.'
p2836
aS'\nAnd we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.\nWe have about a 60 percent response rate\nand improved survival for these pets\nthat were about to be euthanized.\nSo let me show you a couple of\neven more interesting examples.\nThis is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,\nand she had these lesions in her mouth\nthat, over the course of three years,\ndeveloped into invasive squamous cell cancers.\nSo we created an antiangiogenic paste.\nWe had it painted on top of the cancer\nthree times a week.\nAnd over the course of seven months,\nthe cancers completely disappeared,\nand the biopsies came back as normal.'
p2837
aS"\nHere's a cancer growing on the lip\nof a Wuarter horse named Guinness.\nIt's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.\nIt had already spread to his lymph nodes,\nso we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip\nand an oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside\nas well as the outside.\nAnd over the course of six months,\nhe experienced a complete remission.\nAnd here he is six years later,\nGuinness, with his very happy owner."
p2838
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2839
aS"\nNow, obviously, antiangiogenic therapy\ncould be used for a wide range of cancers.\nAnd, in fact, the first pioneering treatments\nfor people, as well as dogs,\nare already becoming available.\nThere's 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.\nBut the real question is:\nHow well do these work in practice?\nSo here's actually the patient survival data\nfrom eight different types of cancer.\nThe bars represent survival time\ntaken from the era\nin which there was only chemotherapy,\nor surgery, or radiation available.\nBut starting in 2004,\nwhen antiangiogenic therapies first became available,\nwell you can see that there has been\na 70 to 100 percent\nimprovement in survival\nfor people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,\ncolorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\nThat's impressive.\nBut for other tumors and cancer types,\nthe improvements have only been modest."
p2840
aS'\nSo I started asking myself,\n"Why haven\'t we been able to do better?"\nAnd the answer, to me, is obvious;\nwe\'re treating cancer too late in the game,\nwhen it\'s already established\nand, oftentimes, it\'s already spread or metastasized.\nAnd as a doctor, I know\nthat once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,\nachieving a cure\ncan be difficult, if not impossible.\nSo I went back to the biology\nof angiogenesis\nand started thinking:\nCould the answer to cancer\nbe preventing angiogenesis,\nbeating cancer at its own game\nso the cancers could never become dangerous?\nThis could help healthy people\nas well as people who\'ve already beaten cancer\nonce or twice\nand want to find a way to keep it from coming back.\nSo to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer,\nI went back to look at cancer\'s causes.\nAnd what really intrigued me\nwas when I saw that diet\naccounts for 30 to 35 percent\nof environmentally caused cancers.'
p2841
aS"\nNow, the obvious thing is to think about\nwhat we could remove from our diet, what to strip out, take away.\nBut I actually took a completely opposite approach\nand began asking: What could we be adding to our diet\nthat's naturally antiangiogenic,\nthat could boost the body's defense system\nand beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?\nIn other words, can we eat to starve cancer? (Laughter)\nWell, the answer's yes,\nand I'm going to show you how.\nOur search for this\nhas taken us to the market, the farm and to the spice cabinet,\nbecause what we've discovered\nis that mother nature has laced a large number\nof foods and beverages and herbs\nwith naturally occurring inhibitors\nof angiogenesis."
p2842
aS"\nSo here's a test system we developed.\nAt the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels\nare growing out in a starburst fashion.\nAnd we can use this system\nto test dietary factors\nat concentrations that are obtainable by eating.\nSo let me show you what happens when we put in\nan extract from red grapes.\nThe active ingredient's resveratrol,\nit's also found in red wine.\nThis inhibits abnormal angiogenesis\nby 60 percent.\nHere's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries;\nit potently inhibits angiogenesis.\nAnd extract from soybeans.\nAnd here is a growing list of our\nantiangiogenic foods and beverages\nthat we're interested in studying.\nFor each food type,\nwe believe that there are different potencies\nwithin different strains and varietals.\nAnd we want to measure this because,\nwell, while you're eating a strawberry\nor drinking tea,\nwhy not select the one that's most potent\nfor preventing cancer."
p2843
aS"\nSo here are four different teas that we've tested.\nThey're all common ones:\nChinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,\nEarl Grey and a special blend that we prepared.\nAnd you can see clearly\nthat the teas vary in their potency\nfrom less potent to more potent.\nBut what's very cool\nis when we actually combined the two\nless potent teas together,\nthe combination, the blend,\nis more potent than either one alone.\nThis means there's food synergy."
p2844
aS"\nHere's some more data from our testing.\nNow, in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis\nrepresented here in a black bar.\nAnd using this system, we can test the potency of cancer drugs.\nSo the shorter the bar,\nless angiogenesis, that's good.\nAnd here are some common drugs\nthat have been associated with reducing the risk\nof cancer in people.\nStatins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nand a few others,\nthey inhibit angiogenesis too.\nAnd here are the dietary factors\ngoing head to head against these drugs.\nYou can see, they clearly hold their own\nand, in some cases, they're more potent\nthan the actual drugs.\nSoy, parsley, garlic,\ngrapes, berries;\nI could go home and cook a tasty meal\nusing these ingredients.\nSo imagine if we could create\nthe world's first rating system\nin which we could score foods\naccording to their antiangiogenic,\ncancer-preventative properties.\nAnd that's what we're doing right now."
p2845
aS"\nNow, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,\nand so the real question is:\nWhat is the evidence in people\nthat eating certain foods can reduce\nangiogenesis in cancer?\nWell, the best example I know\nis a study of 79,000 men\nfollowed over 20 years,\nin which it was found that men who consumed\ncooked tomatoes two to three times a week\nhad up to a 50 percent reduction\nin their risk of developing prostate cancer.\nNow, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,\nand lycopene is antiangiogenic.\nBut what's even more interesting from this study\nis that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,\nthose who ate more servings of tomato sauce\nactually had fewer blood vessels\nfeeding their cancer.\nSo this human study is a prime example\nof how antiangiogenic substances\npresent in food and consumed at practical levels\ncan impact on cancer.\nAnd we're now studying\nthe role of a healthy diet\nwith Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University\non the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis\nthat we can find in the bloodstream."
p2846
aS"\nNow, obviously, what I've shared with you has some far-ranging implications,\neven beyond cancer research.\nBecause if we're right, it could impact on consumer education,\nfood services, public health\nand even the insurance industry.\nAnd, in fact, some insurance companies\nare already beginning to think along these lines.\nCheck out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota.\nAnd for many people around the world,\ndietary cancer prevention\nmay be the only practical solution\nbecause not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments,\nbut everybody could benefit from\na healthy diet based on local, sustainable,\nantiangiogenic crops."
p2847
aS"\nNow, finally,\nI've talked to you about food,\nand I've talked to you about cancer,\nso there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about\nand that's obesity.\nBecause it turns out that\nadipose tissue, fat,\nis highly angiogenesis dependent.\nAnd, like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.\nSo the question is: Can we shrink fat\nby cutting off its blood supply?\nSo the top curve shows the body weight\nof a genetically obese mouse\nthat eats nonstop\nuntil it turns fat, like this furry tennis ball.\nAnd the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse."
p2848
aS"\nIf you take the obese mouse and give it\nan angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.\nStop the treatment, gains the weight back.\nRestart the treatment, loses the weight again.\nStop the treatment, it gains the weight back.\nAnd, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down\nsimply by inhibiting angiogenesis.\nSo this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention\nmay also have an application\nfor obesity.\nThe really, truly interesting thing about this\nis that we can't take these obese mice\nand make them lose more weight\nthan what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.\nIn other words, we can't create supermodel mice.\n(Laughter)\nAnd this speaks to the role of angiogenesis\nin regulating healthy set points."
p2849
aS'\nAlbert Szent-Gyorgi once said that,\n"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,\nand thinking what no one has thought."\nI hope I\'ve convinced you\nthat, for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,\nthat there may be a great power\nin attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.\nAnd that\'s what I think the world needs now. Thank you.'

aS'\n(Applause)'
p2851
aS"\nJune Cohen: I have a quick question for you. So these drugs aren't exactly ...\nthey're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now.\nFor anyone out here who has cancer,\nwhat would you recommend?\nDo you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?"
p2852
aS"\nWilliam Li: So there are antiangiogenic treatments\nthat are FDA approved,\nand if you're a cancer patient\nor working for one or advocating for one,\nyou should ask about them.\nAnd there are many clinical trials.\nThe Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,\nand there are about 100 more\ndrugs in that pipeline.\nSo consider the approved ones,\nlook for clinical trials,\nbut then between what the doctor can do for you,\nwe need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.\nAnd this is one of the themes that I'm talking about\nis we can empower ourselves to do the things\nthat doctors can't do for us,\nwhich is to use knowledge and take action.\nAnd if Mother Nature has given us some clues,\nwe think that there might be a new future\nin the value of how we eat.\nAnd what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day."
p2853
aS'\nJC: Right. And along those lines,\nfor people who might have risk factors for cancer,\nwould you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically\nor simply pursuing the right diet\nwith lots of tomato sauce?'
p2854
aS"\nWL: Well, you know, there's abundant epidemiological evidence.\nAnd I think in the information age,\nit doesn't take long to go to a credible source\nlike PubMed, the National Library of Medicine,\nto look for epidemiological studies\nfor cancer risk reduction\nbased on diet and based on common medications.\nAnd that's certainly something that anybody can look into."
p2855
aS'\nJC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.'

p2857
aa(lp2858
S"\nGood morning.\nI'm here today to talk\nabout autonomous, flying beach balls.\nNo, agile aerial robots like this one.\nI'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these\nand some of the terrific opportunities\nfor applying this technology.\nSo these robots\nare related to unmanned aerial vehicles.\nHowever, the vehicles you see here are big.\nThey weigh thousands of pounds,\nare not by any means agile.\nThey're not even autonomous.\nIn fact, many of these vehicles\nare operated by flight crews\nthat can include multiple pilots,\noperators of sensors\nand mission coordinators."
p2859
aS"\nWhat we're interested in is developing robots like this --\nand here are two other pictures --\nof robots that you can buy off the shelf.\nSo these are helicopters with four rotors\nand they're roughly a meter or so in scale\nand weigh several pounds.\nAnd so we retrofit these with sensors and processors,\nand these robots can fly indoors\nwithout GPS."
p2860
aS"\nThe robot I'm holding in my hand\nis this one,\nand it's been created by two students,\nAlex and Daniel.\nSo this weighs a little more\nthan a tenth of a pound.\nIt consumes about 15 watts of power.\nAnd as you can see,\nit's about eight inches in diameter.\nSo let me give you just a very quick tutorial\non how these robots work."
p2861
aS"\nSo it has four rotors.\nIf you spin these rotors at the same speed,\nthe robot hovers.\nIf you increase the speed of each of these rotors,\nthen the robot flies up, it accelerates up.\nOf course, if the robot were tilted,\ninclined to the horizontal,\nthen it would accelerate in this direction.\nSo to get it to tilt, there's one of two ways of doing it.\nSo in this picture\nyou see that rotor four is spinning faster\nand rotor two is spinning slower.\nAnd when that happens\nthere's moment that causes this robot to roll.\nAnd the other way around,\nif you increase the speed of rotor three\nand decrease the speed of rotor one,\nthen the robot pitches forward."
p2862
aS"\nAnd then finally,\nif you spin opposite pairs of rotors\nfaster than the other pair,\nthen the robot yaws about the vertical axis.\nSo an on-board processor\nessentially looks at what motions need to be executed\nand combines these motions\nand figures out what commands to send to the motors\n600 times a second.\nThat's basically how this thing operates."
p2863
aS"\nSo one of the advantages of this design\nis, when you scale things down,\nthe robot naturally becomes agile.\nSo here R\nis the characteristic length of the robot.\nIt's actually half the diameter.\nAnd there are lots of physical parameters that change\nas you reduce R.\nThe one that's the most important\nis the inertia or the resistance to motion.\nSo it turns out,\nthe inertia, which governs angular motion,\nscales as a fifth power of R.\nSo the smaller you make R,\nthe more dramatically the inertia reduces.\nSo as a result, the angular acceleration,\ndenoted by Greek letter alpha here,\ngoes as one over R.\nIt's inversely proportional to R.\nThe smaller you make it the more quickly you can turn."
p2864
aS'\nSo this should be clear in these videos.\nAt the bottom right you see a robot\nperforming a 360 degree flip\nin less than half a second.\nMultiple flips, a little more time.\nSo here the processes on board\nare getting feedback from accelerometers\nand gyros on board\nand calculating, like I said before,\ncommands at 600 times a second\nto stabilize this robot.\nSo on the left, you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air.\nAnd it shows you how robust the control is.\nNo matter how you throw it,\nthe robot recovers and comes back to him.'
p2865
aS"\nSo why build robots like this?\nWell robots like this have many applications.\nYou can send them inside buildings like this\nas first responders to look for intruders,\nmaybe look for biochemical leaks,\ngaseous leaks.\nYou can also use them\nfor applications like construction.\nSo here are robots carrying beams, columns\nand assembling cube-like structures.\nI'll tell you a little bit more about this.\nThe robots can be used for transporting cargo.\nSo one of the problems with these small robots\nis their payload carrying capacity.\nSo you might want to have multiple robots\ncarry payloads.\nThis is a picture of a recent experiment we did --\nactually not so recent anymore --\nin Sendai shortly after the earthquake.\nSo robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings\nto assess the damage after natural disasters,\nor sent into reactor buildings\nto map radiation levels."
p2866
aS"\nSo one fundamental problem\nthat the robots have to solve if they're to be autonomous\nis essentially figuring out\nhow to get from point A to point B.\nSo this gets a little challenging\nbecause the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated.\nIn fact, they live in a 12-dimensional space.\nSo we use a little trick.\nWe take this curved 12-dimensional space\nand transform it\ninto a flat four-dimensional space.\nAnd that four-dimensional space\nconsists of X, Y, Z and then the yaw angle."
p2867
aS'\nAnd so what the robot does\nis it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory.\nSo to remind you of physics,\nyou have position, derivative, velocity,\nthen acceleration,\nand then comes jerk\nand then comes snap.\nSo this robot minimizes snap.\nSo what that effectively does\nis produces a smooth and graceful motion.\nAnd it does that avoiding obstacles.\nSo these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space\nare then transformed back\ninto this complicated 12-dimensional space,\nwhich the robot must do\nfor control and then execution.'
p2868
aS"\nSo let me show you some examples\nof what these minimum snap trajectories look like.\nAnd in the first video,\nyou'll see the robot going from point A to point B\nthrough an intermediate point.\nSo the robot is obviously capable\nof executing any curve trajectory.\nSo these are circular trajectories\nwhere the robot pulls about two G's.\nHere you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top\nthat tell the robot where it is 100 times a second.\nIt also tells the robot where these obstacles are.\nAnd the obstacles can be moving.\nAnd here you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air,\nwhile the robot is calculating the position of the hoop\nand trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop.\nSo as an academic,\nwe're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs,\nand we get our robots to do that."
p2869
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2870
aS'\nSo another thing the robot can do\nis it remembers pieces of trajectory\nthat it learns or is pre-programmed.\nSo here you see the robot\ncombining a motion\nthat builds up momentum\nand then changes its orientation and then recovers.\nSo it has to do this because this gap in the window\nis only slightly larger than the width of the robot.\nSo just like a diver stands on a springboard\nand then jumps off it to gain momentum,\nand then does this pirouette, this two and a half somersault through\nand then gracefully recovers,\nthis robot is basically doing that.\nSo it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories\nto do these fairly difficult tasks.'
p2871
aS"\nSo I want change gears.\nSo one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size.\nAnd I told you earlier\nthat we may want to employ lots and lots of robots\nto overcome the limitations of size.\nSo one difficulty\nis how do you coordinate lots of these robots?\nAnd so here we looked to nature.\nSo I want to show you a clip\nof Aphaenogaster desert ants\nin Professor Stephen Pratt's lab carrying an object.\nSo this is actually a piece of fig.\nActually you take any object coated with fig juice\nand the ants will carry them back to the nest.\nSo these ants don't have any central coordinator.\nThey sense their neighbors.\nThere's no explicit communication.\nBut because they sense the neighbors\nand because they sense the object,\nthey have implicit coordination across the group."
p2872
aS"\nSo this is the kind of coordination\nwe want our robots to have.\nSo when we have a robot\nwhich is surrounded by neighbors --\nand let's look at robot I and robot J --\nwhat we want the robots to do\nis to monitor the separation between them\nas they fly in formation.\nAnd then you want to make sure\nthat this separation is within acceptable levels.\nSo again the robots monitor this error\nand calculate the control commands\n100 times a second,\nwhich then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second.\nSo this also has to be done\nin a decentralized way.\nAgain, if you have lots and lots of robots,\nit's impossible to coordinate all this information centrally\nfast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task.\nPlus the robots have to base their actions\nonly on local information,\nwhat they sense from their neighbors.\nAnd then finally,\nwe insist that the robots be agnostic\nto who their neighbors are.\nSo this is what we call anonymity."
p2873
aS"\nSo what I want to show you next\nis a video\nof 20 of these little robots\nflying in formation.\nThey're monitoring their neighbors' position.\nThey're maintaining formation.\nThe formations can change.\nThey can be planar formations,\nthey can be three-dimensional formations.\nAs you can see here,\nthey collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation.\nAnd to fly through obstacles\nthey can adapt the formations on the fly.\nSo again, these robots come really close together.\nAs you can see in this figure-eight flight,\nthey come within inches of each other.\nAnd despite the aerodynamic interactions\nof these propeller blades,\nthey're able to maintain stable flight."
p2874
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2875
aS"\nSo once you know how to fly in formation,\nyou can actually pick up objects cooperatively.\nSo this just shows\nthat we can double, triple, quadruple\nthe robot strength\nby just getting them to team with neighbors, as you can see here.\nOne of the disadvantages of doing that\nis, as you scale things up --\nso if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing,\nyou're essentially effectively increasing the inertia,\nand therefore you pay a price; they're not as agile.\nBut you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity."
p2876
aS"\nAnother application I want to show you --\nagain, this is in our lab.\nThis is work done by Quentin Lindsey who's a graduate student.\nSo his algorithm essentially tells these robots\nhow to autonomously build\ncubic structures\nfrom truss-like elements.\nSo his algorithm tells the robot\nwhat part to pick up,\nwhen and where to place it.\nSo in this video you see --\nand it's sped up 10, 14 times --\nyou see three different structures being built by these robots.\nAnd again, everything is autonomous,\nand all Quentin has to do\nis to get them a blueprint\nof the design that he wants to build."
p2877
aS"\nSo all these experiments you've seen thus far,\nall these demonstrations,\nhave been done with the help of motion capture systems.\nSo what happens when you leave your lab\nand you go outside into the real world?\nAnd what if there's no GPS?\nSo this robot\nis actually equipped with a camera\nand a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.\nAnd it uses these sensors\nto build a map of the environment.\nWhat that map consists of are features --\nlike doorways, windows,\npeople, furniture --\nand it then figures out where its position is\nwith respect to the features.\nSo there is no global coordinate system.\nThe coordinate system is defined based on the robot,\nwhere it is and what it's looking at.\nAnd it navigates with respect to those features."
p2878
aS"\nSo I want to show you a clip\nof algorithms developed by Frank Shen\nand Professor Nathan Michael\nthat shows this robot entering a building for the very first time\nand creating this map on the fly.\nSo the robot then figures out what the features are.\nIt builds the map.\nIt figures out where it is with respect to the features\nand then estimates its position\n100 times a second\nallowing us to use the control algorithms\nthat I described to you earlier.\nSo this robot is actually being commanded\nremotely by Frank.\nBut the robot can also figure out\nwhere to go on its own.\nSo suppose I were to send this into a building\nand I had no idea what this building looked like,\nI can ask this robot to go in,\ncreate a map\nand then come back and tell me what the building looks like.\nSo here, the robot is not only solving the problem,\nhow to go from point A to point B in this map,\nbut it's figuring out\nwhat the best point B is at every time.\nSo essentially it knows where to go\nto look for places that have the least information.\nAnd that's how it populates this map."
p2879
aS"\nSo I want to leave you\nwith one last application.\nAnd there are many applications of this technology.\nI'm a professor, and we're passionate about education.\nRobots like this can really change the way\nwe do K through 12 education.\nBut we're in Southern California,\nclose to Los Angeles,\nso I have to conclude\nwith something focused on entertainment.\nI want to conclude with a music video.\nI want to introduce the creators, Alex and Daniel,\nwho created this video."

S'\nI want to talk about social innovation\nand social entrepreneurship.\nI happen to have triplets.\nThey\'re little. They\'re five years old.\nSometimes I tell people I have triplets.\nThey say, "Really? How many?"\nHere\'s a picture of the kids.\nThat\'s Sage and Annalisa and Rider.\nNow, I also happen to be gay.\nBeing gay and fathering triplets is by far\nthe most socially innovative, socially entrepreneurial thing\nI have ever done.'
p2886
aS'\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p2887
aS"\nThe real social innovation I want to talk about\ninvolves charity.\nI want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think\nabout giving and about charity\nand about the nonprofit sector\nare actually undermining the causes we love\nand our profound yearning to change the world."
p2888
aS"\nBut before I do that, I want to ask if we even believe\nthat the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play\nin changing the world.\nA lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies,\nand social business will take care of the rest.\nAnd I do believe that business will move\nthe great mass of humanity forward.\nBut it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more\nthat is most disadvantaged or unlucky.\nAnd social business needs markets,\nand there are some issues for which you just can't develop\nthe kind of money measures that you need for a market.\nI sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled,\nand these people want laughter\nand compassion and they want love.\nHow do you monetize that?\nAnd that's where the nonprofit sector\nand philanthropy come in.\nPhilanthropy is the market for love.\nIt is the market for all those people\nfor whom there is no other market coming.\nAnd so if we really want, like Buckminster Fuller said,\na world that works for everyone,\nwith no one and nothing left out,\nthen the nonprofit sector has to be\na serious part of the conversation."
p2889
aS"\nBut it doesn't seem to be working.\nWhy have our breast cancer charities\nnot come close to finding a cure for breast cancer,\nor our homeless charities not come close\nto ending homelessness in any major city?\nWhy has poverty remained stuck at 12 percent\nof the U.S. population for 40 years?"
p2890
aS"\nAnd the answer is, these social problems\nare massive in scale,\nour organizations are tiny up against them,\nand we have a belief system that keeps them tiny.\nWe have two rulebooks.\nWe have one for the nonprofit sector\nand one for the rest of the economic world.\nIt's an apartheid, and it discriminates\nagainst the [nonprofit] sector in five different areas,\nthe first being compensation."
p2891
aS"\nSo in the for-profit sector, the more value you produce,\nthe more money you can make.\nBut we don't like nonprofits to use money\nto incentivize people to produce more in social service.\nWe have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone\nwould make very much money helping other people.\nInteresting that we don't have a visceral reaction\nto the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people.\nYou know, you want to make 50 million dollars\nselling violent video games to kids, go for it.\nWe'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.\nBut you want to make half a million dollars\ntrying to cure kids of malaria,\nand you're considered a parasite yourself. (Applause)"
p2892
aS"\nAnd we think of this as our system of ethics,\nbut what we don't realize is that this system\nhas a powerful side effect, which is,\nit gives a really stark, mutually exclusive choice\nbetween doing very well for yourself and your family\nor doing good for the world\nto the brightest minds coming out of our best universities,\nand sends tens of thousands of people\nwho could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector\nmarching every year directly into the for-profit sector\nbecause they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.\nBusinessweek did a survey, looked at the compensation packages\nfor MBAs 10 years of business school,\nand the median compensation for a Stanford MBA,\nwith bonus, at the age of 38, was 400,000 dollars.\nMeanwhile, for the same year, the average salary\nfor the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S.\nwas 232,000 dollars, and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.\nNow, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people\nwith $400,000 talent to make a $316,000 sacrifice\nevery year to become the CEO of a hunger charity."
p2893
aS'\nSome people say, "Well, that\'s just because those MBA types are greedy."\nNot necessarily. They might be smart.\nIt\'s cheaper for that person to donate\n100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity,\nsave 50,000 dollars on their taxes,\nso still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game,\nnow be called a philanthropist because they donated\n100,000 dollars to charity,\nprobably sit on the board of the hunger charity,\nindeed, probably supervise the poor SOB\nwho decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity,\nand have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence\nand popular praise still ahead of them.'
p2894
aS'\nThe second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing.\nSo we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising\nuntil the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."\nBut we don\'t like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.\nOur attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated,\nyou know, at four o\'clock in the morning, I\'m okay with that.\nBut I don\'t want my donations spent on advertising.\nI want it go to the needy."\nAs if the money invested in advertising\ncould not bring in dramatically greater sums of money\nto serve the needy.'
p2895
aS'\nIn the 1990s, my company created\nthe long distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys\nand the 60-mile-long breast cancer three-day walks,\nand over the course of nine years,\nwe had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate,\nand they raised a total of 581 million dollars.\nThey raised more money more quickly for these causes\nthan any events in history,\nall based on the idea that people are weary\nof being asked to do the least they can possibly do.\nPeople are yearning to measure\nthe full distance of their potential\non behalf of the causes that they care about deeply.\nBut they have to be asked.\nWe got that many people to participate\nby buying full-page ads in The New York Times,\nin The Boston Globe, in primetime radio and TV advertising.\nDo you know how many people we would have gotten\nif we put up flyers in the laundromat?'
p2896
aS'\nCharitable giving has remained stuck, in the U.S.,\nat two percent of GDP ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s.\nThat\'s an important fact, because it tells us\nthat in 40 years, the nonprofit sector\nhas not been able to wrestle any market share\naway from the for-profit sector.\nAnd if you think about it, how could one sector\npossibly take market share away from another sector\nif it isn\'t really allowed to market?\nAnd if we tell the consumer brands,\n"You may advertise all the benefits of your product,"\nbut we tell charities, "You cannot advertise all the good that you do,"\nwhere do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow?'
p2897
aS"\nThe third area of discrimination is the taking of risk\nin pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue.\nSo Disney can make a new $200 million movie that flops,\nand nobody calls the attorney general.\nBut you do a little $1 million community fundraiser\nfor the poor, and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit\nto the cause in the first 12 months,\nand your character is called into question.\nSo nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave,\ndaring, giant-scale new fundraising endeavors\nfor fear that if the thing fails, their reputations\nwill be dragged through the mud.\nWell, you and I know when you prohibit failure,\nyou kill innovation.\nIf you kill innovation in fundraising, you can't raise more revenue.\nIf you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow.\nAnd if you can't grow, you can't possibly solve large social problems."
p2898
aS'\nThe fourth area is time.\nSo Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors,\nand people had patience.\nThey knew that there was a long-term objective down the line\nof building market dominance.\nBut if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream\nof building magnificent scale that required that for six years,\nno money was going to go to the needy,\nit was all going to be invested in building this scale,\nwe would expect a crucifixion.'
p2899
aS"\nAnd the last area is profit itself.\nSo the for-profit sector can pay people profits\nin order to attract their capital for their new ideas,\nbut you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector,\nso the for-profit sector has a lock on the multi-trillion-dollar capital markets,\nand the nonprofit sector is starved for growth\nand risk and idea capital."
p2900
aS"\nWell, you put those five things together -- you can't use money\nto lure talent away from the for-profit sector,\nyou can't advertise on anywhere near the scale\nthe for-profit sector does for new customers,\nyou can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers\nthat the for-profit sector takes,\nyou don't have the same amount of time to find them\nas the for-profit sector,\nand you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this,\neven if you could do it in the first place,\nand you've just put the nonprofit sector\nat an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector\non every level.\nIf we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book,\nthis statistic is sobering:\nFrom 1970 to 2009,\nthe number of nonprofits that really grew,\nthat crossed the $50 million annual revenue barrier,\nis 144.\nIn the same time, the number of for-profits that crossed it\nis 46,136.\nSo we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale,\nand our organizations can't generate any scale.\nAll of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King."
p2901
aS"\nSo why do we think this way?\nWell, like most fanatical dogma in America,\nthese ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.\nThe Puritans came here for religious reasons, or so they said,\nbut they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money.\nThey were pious people but they were also\nreally aggressive capitalists,\nand they were accused of extreme forms of profit-making tendencies\ncompared to the other colonists.\nBut at the same time, the Puritans were Calvinists,\nso they were taught literally to hate themselves.\nThey were taught that self-interest was a raging sea\nthat was a sure path to eternal damnation.\nWell, this created a real problem for these people, right?\nHere they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money.\nMaking all this money will get you sent directly to Hell.\nWhat were they to do about this?"
p2902
aS'\nWell, charity became their answer.\nIt became this economic sanctuary\nwhere they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies\nat five cents on the dollar.\nSo of course, how could you make money in charity\nif charity was your penance for making money?\nFinancial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others\nso that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself,\nand in 400 years, nothing has intervened\nto say, "That\'s counterproductive and that\'s unfair."'
p2903
aS'\nNow this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question,\nwhich is, "What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead?"\nThere are a lot of problems with this question.\nI\'m going to just focus on two.\nFirst, it makes us think that overhead is a negative,\nthat it is somehow not part of the cause.\nBut it absolutely is, especially if it\'s being used for growth.\nNow, this idea that overhead is somehow\nan enemy of the cause\ncreates this second, much larger problem, which is,\nit forces organizations to go without the overhead things\nthey really need to grow\nin the interest of keeping overhead low.'
p2904
aS"\nSo we've all been taught that charities should spend\nas little as possible on overhead things like fundraising\nunder the theory that, well, the less money you spend on fundraising,\nthe more money there is available for the cause.\nWell, that's true if it's a depressing world\nin which this pie cannot be made any bigger.\nBut if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising\nactually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger,\nthen we have it precisely backwards,\nand we should be investing more money, not less,\nin fundraising, because fundraising is the one thing\nthat has the potential to multiply the amount of money\navailable for the cause that we care about so deeply."
p2905
aS"\nI'll give you two examples. We launched the AIDSRides\nwith an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.\nWithin nine years, we had multiplied that 1,982 times\ninto 108 million dollars after all expenses for AIDS services.\nWe launched the breast cancer three-days\nwith an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.\nWithin just five years, we had multiplied that 554 times\ninto 194 million dollars after all expenses\nfor breast cancer research.\nNow, if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer,\nwhat would make more sense:\ngo out and find the most innovative researcher in the world\nand give her 350,000 dollars for research,\nor give her fundraising department the 350,000 dollars\nto multiply it into 194 million dollars for breast cancer research?"
p2906
aS'\n2002 was our most successful year ever.\nWe netted for breast cancer alone, that year alone,\n71 million dollars after all expenses.\nAnd then we went out of business,\nsuddenly and traumatically.'
p2907
aS'\nWhy? Well, the short story is, our sponsor split on us.\nThey wanted to distance themselves from us\nbecause we were being crucified in the media\nfor investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment\nand customer service and the magic of the experience\nand there is no accounting terminology to describe\nthat kind of investment in growth and in the future,\nother than this demonic label of overhead.\nSo on one day, all 350 of our great employees\nlost their jobs\nbecause they were labeled overhead.\nOur sponsor went and tried the events on their own.\nThe overhead went up.\nNet income for breast cancer research went down\nby 84 percent, or 60 million dollars in one year.'
p2908
aS"\nThis is what happens when we confuse\nmorality with frugality.\nWe've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead\nis morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with 40 percent overhead,\nbut we're missing the most important piece of information,\nwhich is, what is the actual size of these pies?\nWho cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?\nWhat if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity\nbecause it made no investment in its scale\nand the professional fundraising enterprise netted\n71 million dollars because it did?\nNow which pie would we prefer, and which pie\ndo we think people who are hungry would prefer?"
p2909
aS"\nHere's how all of this impacts the big picture.\nI said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States.\nThat's about 300 billion dollars a year.\nBut only about 20 percent of that, or 60 billion dollars,\ngoes to health and human services causes.\nThe rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals\nand that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough\nto tackle these problems.\nBut if we could move charitable giving\nfrom two percent of GDP up just one step\nto three percent of GDP, by investing in that growth,\nthat would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions,\nand if that money could go disproportionately\nto health and human services charities,\nbecause those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth,\nthat would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector.\nNow we're talking scale.\nNow we're talking the potential for real change.\nBut it's never going to happen by forcing\nthese organizations to lower their horizons\nto the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low."
p2910
aS'\nOur generation does not want its epitaph to read,\n"We kept charity overhead low."\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nWe want it to read that we changed the world,\nand that part of the way we did that\nwas by changing the way we think about these things.\nSo the next time you\'re looking at a charity,\ndon\'t ask about the rate of their overhead.\nAsk about the scale of their dreams,\ntheir Apple-, Google-, Amazon-scale dreams,\nhow they measure their progress toward those dreams,\nand what resources they need to make them come true\nregardless of what the overhead is.\nWho cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved?\nIf we can have that kind of generosity,\na generosity of thought, then the non-profit sector can play\na massive role in changing the world for all those citizens\nmost desperately in need of it to change.\nAnd if that can be our generation\'s enduring legacy,\nthat we took responsibility\nfor the thinking that had been handed down to us,\nthat we revisited it, we revised it,\nand we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things,\nforever, for everyone,\nwell, I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be.\nAnnalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be --\nSage Smith-Pallotta: -- a real social --\nRider Smith-Pallotta: -- innovation.'

S'\nDoc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity\nwith this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,\nand exposure just a millionth of a second.\nBut now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster\nand see the world not at a million,\nor a billion,\nbut one trillion frames per second.'
p2915
aS'\nI present you a new type of photography,\nfemto-photography,\na new imaging technique so fast\nthat it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.\nAnd with that, we can create cameras\nthat can look around corners,\nbeyond line of sight\nor see inside our body without an X-ray,\nand really challenge what we mean by a camera.'
p2916
aS"\nNow if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off\nin one trillionth of a second --\nwhich is several femtoseconds --\nI'll create a packet of photons\nbarely a millimeter wide,\nand that packet of photons, that bullet,\nwill travel at the speed of light,\nand, again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.\nNow, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons\nand fire into this bottle,\nhow will those photons shatter into this bottle?\nHow does light look in slow motion?"
p2917
aS'\nNow, the whole event -- (Applause)\n(Applause)'
p2918
aS"\nNow, remember, the whole event\nis effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond\n that's how much time it takes for light to travel \nbut I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion\nso you can see the light in motion."
p2919
aS'\nBut, Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research. (Laughter)'
p2920
aS"\nNow, there's a lot going on in this movie,\nso let me break this down and show you what's going on.\nSo, the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,\nwith a packet of photons that start traveling through\nand that start scattering inside.\nSome of the light leaks, goes on the table,\nand you start seeing these ripples of waves.\nMany of the photons eventually reach the cap\nand then they explode in various directions.\nAs you can see, there's a bubble of air,\nand it's bouncing around inside.\nMeanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,\nand because of the reflections at the top,\nyou see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,\nthe reflections are focused."
p2921
aS"\nNow, if you take an ordinary bullet\nand let it go the same distance and slow down the video\nagain by a factor of 10 billion, do you know\nhow long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?\nA day, a week? Actually, a whole year.\nIt'll be a very boring movie  (Laughter) \nof a slow, ordinary bullet in motion."
p2922
aS'\nAnd what about some still-life photography?'
p2923
aS"\nYou can watch the ripples again washing over the table,\nthe tomato and the wall in the back.\nIt's like throwing a stone in a pond of water."
p2924
aS"\nI thought, this is how nature paints a photo,\none femto frame at a time,\nbut of course our eye sees an integral composite.\nBut if you look at this tomato one more time,\nyou will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,\nit continues to glow. It doesn't become dark.\nWhy is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe,\nand the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,\nand it comes out after several trillionths of a second.\nSo, in the future, when this femto-camera\nis in your camera phone,\nyou might be able to go to a supermarket\nand check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it."
p2925
aS"\nSo how did my team at MIT create this camera?\nNow, as photographers, you know,\nif you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light,\nbut we're going to go a billion times faster\nthan your shortest exposure,\nso you're going to get hardly any light.\nSo, what we do is we send that bullet,\nthose packet of photons, millions of times,\nand record again and again with very clever synchronization,\nand from the gigabytes of data,\nwe computationally weave together\nto create those femto-videos I showed you."
p2926
aS"\nAnd we can take all that raw data\nand treat it in very interesting ways.\nSo, Superman can fly.\nSome other heroes can become invisible,\nbut what about a new power for a future superhero:\nto see around corners?\nThe idea is that we could shine some light on the door.\nIt's going to bounce, go inside the room,\nsome of that is going to reflect back on the door,\nand then back to the camera,\nand we could exploit these multiple bounces of light."
p2927
aS"\nAnd it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.\nOn the left, you see our femto-camera.\nThere's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,\nand we're going to bounce light off the door."
p2928
aS'\nSo after our paper was published\nin Nature Communications,\nit was highlighted by Nature.com,\nand they created this animation.'
p2929
aS'\n(Music)'
p2930
aS"\nWe're going to fire those bullets of light,\nand they're going to hit this wall,\nand because the packet of the photons,\nthey will scatter in all the directions,\nand some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,\nwhich in turn will again scatter that light,\nand again in turn the door will reflect\nsome of that scattered light,\nand a tiny fraction of the photons will actually\ncome back to the camera, but most interestingly,\nthey will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.\n(Music)"
p2931
aS"\nAnd because we have a camera that can run so fast,\nour femto-camera, it has some unique abilities.\nIt has very good time resolution,\nand it can look at the world at the speed of light.\nAnd this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,\nbut also to the hidden objects,\nbut we don't know which point corresponds\nto which distance.\n(Music)"
p2932
aS"\nBy shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which,\nyou look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense,\nbut then we will take a lot of such pictures,\ndozens of such pictures, put them together,\nand try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,\nand from that, can we see the hidden object?\nCan we see it in full 3D?"
p2933
aS'\nSo this is our reconstruction. (Music)\n(Music)\n(Music) (Applause)'
p2934
aS"\nNow we have some ways to go before we take this\noutside the lab on the road, but in the future,\nwe could create cars that avoid collisions\nwith what's around the bend,\nor we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions\nby looking at light reflected through open windows,\nor we can build endoscopes that can see\ndeep inside the body around occluders,\nand also for cardioscopes.\nBut of course, because of tissue and blood,\nthis is quite challenging, so this is really a call\nfor scientists to start thinking about femto-photography\nas really a new imaging modality to solve\nthe next generation of health imaging problems."
p2935
aS"\nNow, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,\nscience became art, an art of ultra-fast photography,\nand I realized that all the gigabytes of data\nthat we're collecting every time\nis not just for scientific imaging, but we can also do\na new form of computational photography\nwith time-lapse and color-coding,\nand we look at those ripples. Remember,\nthe time between each of those ripples is only\na few trillionths of a second."
p2936
aS"\nBut there's also something funny going on here.\nWhen you look at the ripples under the cap,\nthe ripples are moving away from us.\nThe ripples should be moving towards us.\nWhat's going on here?"
p2937
aS"\nIt turns out, because we're recording\nnearly at the speed of light,\nwe have strange effects,\nand Einstein would have loved to see this picture.\nThe order at which events take place in the world\nappear in the camera with sometimes reversed order,\nso by applying the corresponding space and time warp,\nwe can correct for this distortion."
p2938
aS"\nSo whether it's for photography around corners,\nor creating the next generation of health imaging,\nor creating new visualizations,\nsince our invention, we have open-sourced\nall the data and details on our website, and our hope\nis that the DIY, the creative and the research community\nwill show us that we should stop obsessing about\nthe megapixels in cameras  (Laughter) \nand start focusing on the next dimension in imaging.\nIt's about time. Thank you. (Applause)\n(Applause)"

S"\nThis is a photograph\nby the artist Michael Najjar,\nand it's real,\nin the sense that he went there to Argentina\nto take the photo.\nBut it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.\nAnd what he's done\nis he's actually reshaped, digitally,\nall of the contours of the mountains\nto follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.\nSo what you see,\nthat precipice, that high precipice with the valley,\nis the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe photo was made\nwhen we were deep in the valley over there.\nI don't know where we are now.\nThis is the Hang Seng index\nfor Hong Kong.\nAnd similar topography.\nI wonder why."
p2941
aS"\nAnd this is art. This is metaphor.\nBut I think the point is\nthat this is metaphor with teeth,\nand it's with those teeth that I want to propose today\nthat we rethink a little bit\nabout the role of contemporary math --\nnot just financial math, but math in general.\nThat its transition\nfrom being something that we extract and derive from the world\nto something that actually starts to shape it --\nthe world around us and the world inside us.\nAnd it's specifically algorithms,\nwhich are basically the math\nthat computers use to decide stuff.\nThey acquire the sensibility of truth\nbecause they repeat over and over again,\nand they ossify and calcify,\nand they become real."
p2942
aS'\nAnd I was thinking about this, of all places,\non a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,\nbecause I happened to be seated\nnext to a Hungarian physicist about my age\nand we were talking\nabout what life was like during the Cold War\nfor physicists in Hungary.\nAnd I said, "So what were you doing?"'
p2943
aS'\nAnd he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."'
p2944
aS'\nAnd I said, "That\'s a good job. That\'s interesting.\nHow does that work?"\nAnd to understand that,\nyou have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.\nAnd so -- this is an over-simplification --\nbut basically, it\'s not like\nyou can just pass a radar signal\nright through 156 tons of steel in the sky.\nIt\'s not just going to disappear.\nBut if you can take this big, massive thing,\nand you could turn it into\na million little things --\nsomething like a flock of birds --\nwell then the radar that\'s looking for that\nhas to be able to see\nevery flock of birds in the sky.\nAnd if you\'re a radar, that\'s a really bad job.'
p2945
aS'\nAnd he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that\'s if you\'re a radar.\nSo we didn\'t use a radar;\nwe built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,\nelectronic communication.\nAnd whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,\nwe thought, \'Probably has something to do with the Americans.\'"'
p2946
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yeah.\nThat\'s good.\nSo you\'ve effectively negated\n60 years of aeronautic research.\nWhat\'s your act two?\nWhat do you do when you grow up?"\nAnd he said,\n"Well, financial services."\nAnd I said, "Oh."\nBecause those had been in the news lately.\nAnd I said, "How does that work?"\nAnd he said, "Well there\'s 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,\nand I\'m one of them."\nAnd I said, "What\'s the black box for Wall Street?"'

aS'\nAnd he said, "It\'s funny you ask that,\nbecause it\'s actually called black box trading.\nAnd it\'s also sometimes called algo trading,\nalgorithmic trading."\nAnd algorithmic trading evolved in part\nbecause institutional traders have the same problems\nthat the United States Air Force had,\nwhich is that they\'re moving these positions --\nwhether it\'s Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever --\nthey\'re moving a million shares of something\nthrough the market.\nAnd if they do that all at once,\nit\'s like playing poker and going all in right away.\nYou just tip your hand.\nAnd so they have to find a way --\nand they use algorithms to do this --\nto break up that big thing\ninto a million little transactions.\nAnd the magic and the horror of that\nis that the same math\nthat you use to break up the big thing\ninto a million little things\ncan be used to find a million little things\nand sew them back together\nand figure out what\'s actually happening in the market.'
p2948
aS"\nSo if you need to have some image\nof what's happening in the stock market right now,\nwhat you can picture is a bunch of algorithms\nthat are basically programmed to hide,\nand a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.\nAnd all of that's great, and it's fine.\nAnd that's 70 percent\nof the United States stock market,\n70 percent of the operating system\nformerly known as your pension,\nyour mortgage."
p2949
aS'\nAnd what could go wrong?\nWhat could go wrong\nis that a year ago,\nnine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,\nand they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.\nAll of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,\nand nobody to this day\ncan even agree on what happened\nbecause nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.\nNobody had any control over what was actually happening.\nAll they had\nwas just a monitor in front of them\nthat had the numbers on it\nand just a red button\nthat said, "Stop."'
p2950
aS"\nAnd that's the thing,\nis that we're writing things,\nwe're writing these things that we can no longer read.\nAnd we've rendered something\nillegible,\nand we've lost the sense\nof what's actually happening\nin this world that we've made.\nAnd we're starting to make our way.\nThere's a company in Boston called Nanex,\nand they use math and magic\nand I don't know what,\nand they reach into all the market data\nand they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.\nAnd when they find them they pull them out\nand they pin them to the wall like butterflies.\nAnd they do what we've always done\nwhen confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand --\nwhich is that they give them a name\nand a story.\nSo this is one that they found,\nthey called the Knife,\nthe Carnival,\nthe Boston Shuffler,\nTwilight."
p2951
aS'\nAnd the gag is\nthat, of course, these aren\'t just running through the market.\nYou can find these kinds of things wherever you look,\nonce you learn how to look for them.\nYou can find it here: this book about flies\nthat you may have been looking at on Amazon.\nYou may have noticed it\nwhen its price started at 1.7 million dollars.\nIt\'s out of print -- still ...\n(Laughter)\nIf you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.\nA few hours later, it had gone up\nto 23.6 million dollars,\nplus shipping and handling.\nAnd the question is:\nNobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?\nAnd you see this behavior on Amazon\nas surely as you see it on Wall Street.\nAnd when you see this kind of behavior,\nwhat you see is the evidence\nof algorithms in conflict,\nalgorithms locked in loops with each other,\nwithout any human oversight,\nwithout any adult supervision\nto say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."'
p2952
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2953
aS"\nAnd as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.\nAnd so Netflix has gone through\nseveral different algorithms over the years.\nThey started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others --\nthere's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.\nThey're using Pragmatic Chaos now.\nPragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,\ntrying to do the same thing.\nIt's trying to get a grasp on you,\non the firmware inside the human skull,\nso that it can recommend what movie\nyou might want to watch next --\nwhich is a very, very difficult problem.\nBut the difficulty of the problem\nand the fact that we don't really quite have it down,\nit doesn't take away\nfrom the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.\nPragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,\ndetermines, in the end,\n60 percent\nof what movies end up being rented.\nSo one piece of code\nwith one idea about you\nis responsible for 60 percent of those movies."
p2954
aS'\nBut what if you could rate those movies\nbefore they get made?\nWouldn\'t that be handy?\nWell, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,\nand they have "story algorithms" --\na company called Epagogix.\nAnd you can run your script through there,\nand they can tell you, quantifiably,\nthat that\'s a 30 million dollar movie\nor a 200 million dollar movie.\nAnd the thing is, is that this isn\'t Google.\nThis isn\'t information.\nThese aren\'t financial stats; this is culture.\nAnd what you see here,\nor what you don\'t really see normally,\nis that these are the physics of culture.\nAnd if these algorithms,\nlike the algorithms on Wall Street,\njust crashed one day and went awry,\nhow would we know?\nWhat would it look like?'
p2955
aS"\nAnd they're in your house. They're in your house.\nThese are two algorithms competing for your living room.\nThese are two different cleaning robots\nthat have very different ideas about what clean means.\nAnd you can see it\nif you slow it down and attach lights to them,\nand they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.\nAnd the idea that architecture itself\nis somehow subject to algorithmic optimization\nis not far-fetched.\nIt's super-real and it's happening around you."
p2956
aS'\nYou feel it most\nwhen you\'re in a sealed metal box,\na new-style elevator;\nthey\'re called destination-control elevators.\nThese are the ones where you have to press what floor you\'re going to go to\nbefore you get in the elevator.\nAnd it uses what\'s called a bin-packing algorithm.\nSo none of this mishegas\nof letting everybody go into whatever car they want.\nEverybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,\nand everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.\nAnd the problem with that\nis that people freak out.\nPeople panic.\nAnd you see why. You see why.\nIt\'s because the elevator\nis missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.\n(Laughter)\nLike the things that people use.\nAll it has\nis just the number that moves up or down\nand that red button that says, "Stop."\nAnd this is what we\'re designing for.\nWe\'re designing\nfor this machine dialect.\nAnd how far can you take that? How far can you take it?\nYou can take it really, really far.'
p2957
aS"\nSo let me take it back to Wall Street.\nBecause the algorithms of Wall Street\nare dependent on one quality above all else,\nwhich is speed.\nAnd they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.\nAnd just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,\nit takes you 500,000 microseconds\njust to click a mouse.\nBut if you're a Wall Street algorithm\nand you're five microseconds behind,\nyou're a loser.\nSo if you were an algorithm,\nyou'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt\nwho was hollowing out a skyscraper --\nthrowing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,\nand just running steel on the floors\nto get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --\nall so an algorithm\ncould get close to the Internet."
p2958
aS"\nAnd you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.\nAnd of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.\nIn New York, this is where it's distributed from:\nthe Carrier Hotel\nlocated on Hudson Street.\nAnd this is really where the wires come right up into the city.\nAnd the reality is that the further away you are from that,\nyou're a few microseconds behind every time.\nThese guys down on Wall Street,\nMarco Polo and Cherokee Nation,\nthey're eight microseconds\nbehind all these guys\ngoing into the empty buildings being hollowed out\nup around the Carrier Hotel.\nAnd that's going to keep happening.\nWe're going to keep hollowing them out,\nbecause you, inch for inch\nand pound for pound and dollar for dollar,\nnone of you could squeeze revenue out of that space\nlike the Boston Shuffler could."
p2959
aS"\nBut if you zoom out,\nif you zoom out,\nyou would see an 825-mile trench\nbetween New York City and Chicago\nthat's been built over the last few years\nby a company called Spread Networks.\nThis is a fiber optic cable\nthat was laid between those two cities\nto just be able to traffic one signal\n37 times faster than you can click a mouse --\njust for these algorithms,\njust for the Carnival and the Knife.\nAnd when you think about this,\nthat we're running through the United States\nwith dynamite and rock saws\nso that an algorithm can close the deal\nthree microseconds faster,\nall for a communications framework\nthat no human will ever know,\nthat's a kind of manifest destiny;\nand we'll always look for a new frontier."
p2960
aS"\nUnfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.\nThis is just theoretical.\nThis is some mathematicians at MIT.\nAnd the truth is I don't really understand\na lot of what they're talking about.\nIt involves light cones and quantum entanglement,\nand I don't really understand any of that.\nBut I can read this map,\nand what this map says\nis that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,\nthat's where people are, where the cities are,\nyou're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are\nto do that most effectively.\nAnd the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots\nis that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.\nSo that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,\nor platforms.\nWe'll actually part the water\nto pull money out of the air,\nbecause it's a bright future\nif you're an algorithm."
p2961
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p2962
aS"\nAnd it's not the money that's so interesting actually.\nIt's what the money motivates,\nthat we're actually terraforming\nthe Earth itself\nwith this kind of algorithmic efficiency.\nAnd in that light,\nyou go back\nand you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,\nand you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.\nThey're prophecy\nfor the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects\nof the math that we're making.\nAnd the landscape was always made\nby this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration\nbetween nature and man.\nBut now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms --\nthe Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.\nAnd we will have to understand those as nature,\nand in a way, they are."

S'\nWelcome to "Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do."\nI don\'t have children.\nI borrow my friends\' children, so\n(Laughter)\ntake all this advice with a grain of salt.\nI\'m Gever Tulley.\nI\'m a contract computer scientist by trade,\nbut I\'m the founder of something called the Tinkering School.\nIt\'s a summer program which aims to help kids to learn\nhow to build the things that they think of.\nSo we build a lot of things.\nAnd I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders.\nSo if you\'re thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School,\nthey do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.\nSo, you know, we live in a world\nthat\'s subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.\nThere doesn\'t seem to be any limit on how crazy\nchild safety regulations can get.\nWe put suffocation warnings on all the -- on every piece of plastic film\nmanufactured in the United States or for sale\nwith an item in the United States.\nWe put warnings on coffee cups to tell us\nthat the contents may be hot.\nAnd we seem to think that any item\nsharper than a golf ball is too sharp\nfor children under the age of 10.'
p2967
aS'\nSo where does this trend stop?\nWhen we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object,\nevery pokey bit in the world,\nthen the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp\nor not made out of round plastic,\nthey\'ll hurt themselves with it.\nSo, as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone\ngrow ever smaller, we cut off our children from valuable opportunities\nto learn how to interact with the world around them.\nAnd despite all of our best efforts and intentions,\nkids are always going to figure out\nhow to do the most dangerous thing they can,\nin whatever environment they can.\nSo despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety\nand about some simple things that we can do\nto raise our kids to be creative, confident\nand in control of the environment around them.\nAnd what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress.\nThe book is called "50 Dangerous Things."\nThis is five dangerous things.'
p2968
aS"\nThing number one -- play with fire.\nLearning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature\nis a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.\nWhether we remember it or not,\nit's a -- it's the first time we really get\ncontrol of one of these mysterious things.\nThese mysteries are only revealed\nto those who get the opportunity to play with it.\nSo, playing with fire.\nThis is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.\nFrom playing with it, they learn some basic principles about fire,\nabout intake, about combustion, about exhaust.\nThese are the three working elements of fire\nthat you have to have to have a good controlled fire.\nAnd you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory.\nYou don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it.\nYou know, let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me,\nthey're going to learn things\nthat you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys."
p2969
aS"\nNumber two -- own a pocketknife.\nPocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness,\nwhich I think is a terrible thing.\n(Laughter)\nYour first -- your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given.\nYou know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,\nit's a screwdriver and it's a blade.\nAnd it's a -- it's a powerful and empowering tool.\nAnd in a lot of cultures they give knives --\nlike, as soon as they're toddlers they have knives.\nThese are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.\nI first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10,\nand it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives.\nAnd it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self\nthrough a tool at a very young age.\nYou lay down a couple of very simple rules --\nalways cut away from your body, keep the blade sharp, never force it\n-- and these are things kids can understand and practice with.\nAnd yeah, they're going to cut themselves.\nI have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself.\nBut you know, they're young. They heal fast.\n(Laughter)"
p2970
aS"\nNumber three -- throw a spear.\nIt turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things\nand, like muscles, if you don't use parts of your brain,\nthey tend to atrophy over time.\nBut when you exercise them,\nany given muscle adds strength to the whole system\nand that applies to your brain too.\nSo practicing throwing things has been shown to\nstimulate the frontal and parietal lobes,\nwhich have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding,\nand structural problem solving, so it gives a sense --\nit helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.\nAnd throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill,\nso it's very good for that kind of whole-body training.\nThese kinds of target-based practice also\nhelps kids develop attention and concentration skills.\nSo those are great."
p2971
aS"\nNumber four -- deconstruct appliances.\nThere is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.\nNext time you're about to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out.\nTake it apart with your kid, or send him to my school\nand we'll take it apart with them.\nEven if you don't know what the parts are,\npuzzling out what they might be for\nis a really good practice for the kids\nto get sort of the sense that they can take things apart,\nand no matter how complex they are,\nthey can understand parts of them and that means that eventually,\nthey can understand all of them.\nIt's a sense of knowability, that something is knowable.\nSo these black boxes that we live with and take for granted\nare actually complex things made by other people\nand you can understand them."
p2972
aS"\nNumber five -- two-parter.\nBreak the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n(Laughter)\nThere are laws beyond safety regulations\nthat attempt to limit how we can interact with the things\nthat we own -- in this case, digital media.\nIt's a very simple exercise -- buy a song on ITunes, write it to a CD,\nthen rip the CD to an MP3 and play it on your very same computer.\nYou've just broken a law.\nTechnically the RIAA can come and persecute you.\nIt's an important lesson for kids to understand --\nthat some of these laws get broken by accident\nand that laws have to be interpreted.\nAnd it's something we often talk about with the kids\nwhen we're fooling around with things and breaking them open\nand taking them apart and using them for other things --\nand also when we go out and drive a car.\nDriving a car is a -- is a really empowering act for a young child,\nso this is the ultimate.\n(Laughter)"
p2973
aS"\nFor those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law,\nyou can drive a car with your child.\nThis is -- this is a great stage for a kid.\nThis happens about the same time\nthat they get latched onto things like dinosaurs,\nthese big things in the outside world\nthat they're trying to get a grip on.\nA car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.\nAnd that's a really, like -- it gives them a handle on a world\nin a way that they wouldn't -- that they don't often have access to.\nSo -- and it's perfectly legal.\nFind a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it\nand it's on private property, and let them drive your car.\nIt's very safe actually.\nAnd it's fun for the whole family.\n(Laughter)\nSo, let's see.\nI think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK."
p2974
aa(lp2975
S"\nEveryone, please think\nof your biggest personal goal.\nFor real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.\nTake a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?\nImagine deciding right now\nthat you're going to do it.\nImagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.\nImagine their congratulations\nand their high image of you.\nDoesn't it feel good to say it out loud?\nDon't you feel one step closer already,\nlike it's already becoming part of your identity?"
p2976
aS'\nWell, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut,\nbecause that good feeling\nnow will make you less likely to do it.\nRepeated psychology tests have proven\nthat telling someone your goal\nmakes it less likely to happen.\nAny time you have a goal,\nthere are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done\nin order to achieve it.\nIdeally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work.\nBut when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,\npsychologists have found that it\'s called a "social reality."\nThe mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it\'s already done.\nAnd then, because you felt that satisfaction,\nyou\'re less motivated to do\nthe actual hard work necessary. (Laughter)\nSo this goes against the conventional wisdom\nthat we should tell our friends our goals, right --\nso they hold us to it.'
p2977
aS'\nSo, let\'s look at the proof.\n1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology,\ncalled this "substitution."\n1933, Vera Mahler found,\nwhen it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.\n1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this\nand in 2009,\nhe did some new tests that were published.'
p2978
aS"\nIt goes like this:\n163 people across four separate tests --\neveryone wrote down their personal goal.\nThen half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room,\nand half didn't.\nThen everyone was given 45 minutes of work\nthat would directly lead them towards their goal,\nbut they were told that they could stop at any time.\nNow, those who kept their mouths shut\nworked the entire 45 minutes, on average,\nand when asked afterwards,\nsaid that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.\nBut those who had announced it\nquit after only 33 minutes, on average,\nand when asked afterwards,\nsaid that they felt much closer to achieving their goal."
p2979
aS'\nSo, if this is true,\nwhat can we do?\nWell, you could resist the temptation\nto announce your goal.\nYou can delay the gratification\nthat the social acknowledgement brings,\nand you can understand that your mind\nmistakes the talking for the doing.\nBut if you do need to talk about something,\nyou can state it in a way\nthat gives you no satisfaction,\nsuch as, "I really want to run this marathon,\nso I need to train five times a week\nand kick my ass if I don\'t, okay?"'
p2980
aS"\nSo audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal,\nwhat will you say? (Silence)\nExactly, well done."
p2981
aS'\n(Applause)'
p2982
aa(lp2983
S'\nMark Zuckerberg,\na journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.\nAnd the journalist was asking him,\n"Why is this so important?"\nAnd Zuckerberg said,\n"A squirrel dying in your front yard\nmay be more relevant to your interests right now\nthan people dying in Africa."\nAnd I want to talk about\nwhat a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.'
p2984
aS"\nSo when I was growing up\nin a really rural area in Maine,\nthe Internet meant something very different to me.\nIt meant a connection to the world.\nIt meant something that would connect us all together.\nAnd I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy\nand for our society.\nBut there's this shift\nin how information is flowing online,\nand it's invisible.\nAnd if we don't pay attention to it,\nit could be a real problem.\nSo I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time --\nmy Facebook page.\nI'm progressive, politically -- big surprise --\nbut I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.\nI like hearing what they're thinking about;\nI like seeing what they link to;\nI like learning a thing or two.\nAnd so I was surprised when I noticed one day\nthat the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.\nAnd what it turned out was going on\nwas that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on,\nand it was noticing that, actually,\nI was clicking more on my liberal friends' links\nthan on my conservative friends' links.\nAnd without consulting me about it,\nit had edited them out.\nThey disappeared."
p2985
aS"\nSo Facebook isn't the only place\nthat's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic\nediting of the Web.\nGoogle's doing it too.\nIf I search for something, and you search for something,\neven right now at the very same time,\nwe may get very different search results.\nEven if you're logged out, one engineer told me,\nthere are 57 signals\nthat Google looks at --\neverything from what kind of computer you're on\nto what kind of browser you're using\nto where you're located --\nthat it uses to personally tailor your query results.\nThink about it for a second:\nthere is no standard Google anymore.\nAnd you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see.\nYou can't see how different your search results are\nfrom anyone else's."
p2986
aS'\nBut a couple of weeks ago,\nI asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt"\nand to send me screen shots of what they got.\nSo here\'s my friend Scott\'s screen shot.\nAnd here\'s my friend Daniel\'s screen shot.\nWhen you put them side-by-side,\nyou don\'t even have to read the links\nto see how different these two pages are.\nBut when you do read the links,\nit\'s really quite remarkable.\nDaniel didn\'t get anything about the protests in Egypt at all\nin his first page of Google results.\nScott\'s results were full of them.\nAnd this was the big story of the day at that time.\nThat\'s how different these results are becoming.'
p2987
aS'\nSo it\'s not just Google and Facebook either.\nThis is something that\'s sweeping the Web.\nThere are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.\nYahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet,\nis now personalized -- different people get different things.\nHuffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times --\nall flirting with personalization in various ways.\nAnd this moves us very quickly\ntoward a world in which\nthe Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see,\nbut not necessarily what we need to see.\nAs Eric Schmidt said,\n"It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something\nthat has not in some sense\nbeen tailored for them."'
p2988
aS'\nSo I do think this is a problem.\nAnd I think, if you take all of these filters together,\nyou take all these algorithms,\nyou get what I call a filter bubble.\nAnd your filter bubble is your own personal,\nunique universe of information\nthat you live in online.\nAnd what\'s in your filter bubble\ndepends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.\nBut the thing is that you don\'t decide what gets in.\nAnd more importantly,\nyou don\'t actually see what gets edited out.\nSo one of the problems with the filter bubble\nwas discovered by some researchers at Netflix.\nAnd they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny\nthat a lot of us probably have noticed,\nwhich is there are some movies\nthat just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.\nThey enter the queue, they just zip right out.\nSo "Iron Man" zips right out,\nand "Waiting for Superman"\ncan wait for a really long time.'
p2989
aS'\nWhat they discovered\nwas that in our Netflix queues\nthere\'s this epic struggle going on\nbetween our future aspirational selves\nand our more impulsive present selves.\nYou know we all want to be someone\nwho has watched "Rashomon,"\nbut right now\nwe want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.\n(Laughter)\nSo the best editing gives us a bit of both.\nIt gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber\nand a little bit of Afghanistan.\nIt gives us some information vegetables;\nit gives us some information dessert.\nAnd the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters,\nthese personalized filters,\nis that, because they\'re mainly looking\nat what you click on first,\nit can throw off that balance.\nAnd instead of a balanced information diet,\nyou can end up surrounded\nby information junk food.'
p2990
aS"\nWhat this suggests\nis actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.\nIn a broadcast society --\nthis is how the founding mythology goes --\nin a broadcast society,\nthere were these gatekeepers, the editors,\nand they controlled the flows of information.\nAnd along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way,\nand it allowed all of us to connect together,\nand it was awesome.\nBut that's not actually what's happening right now.\nWhat we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch\nfrom human gatekeepers\nto algorithmic ones.\nAnd the thing is that the algorithms\ndon't yet have the kind of embedded ethics\nthat the editors did.\nSo if algorithms are going to curate the world for us,\nif they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see,\nthen we need to make sure\nthat they're not just keyed to relevance.\nWe need to make sure that they also show us things\nthat are uncomfortable or challenging or important --\nthis is what TED does --\nother points of view."
p2991
aS"\nAnd the thing is, we've actually been here before\nas a society.\nIn 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot\nabout their civic responsibilities.\nThen people noticed\nthat they were doing something really important.\nThat, in fact, you couldn't have\na functioning democracy\nif citizens didn't get a good flow of information,\nthat the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter,\nand then journalistic ethics developed.\nIt wasn't perfect,\nbut it got us through the last century.\nAnd so now,\nwe're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.\nAnd we need the new gatekeepers\nto encode that kind of responsibility\ninto the code that they're writing."
p2992
aS"\nI know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google --\nLarry and Sergey --\npeople who have helped build the Web as it is,\nand I'm grateful for that.\nBut we really need you to make sure\nthat these algorithms have encoded in them\na sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.\nWe need you to make sure that they're transparent enough\nthat we can see what the rules are\nthat determine what gets through our filters.\nAnd we need you to give us some control\nso that we can decide\nwhat gets through and what doesn't.\nBecause I think\nwe really need the Internet to be that thing\nthat we all dreamed of it being.\nWe need it to connect us all together.\nWe need it to introduce us to new ideas\nand new people and different perspectives.\nAnd it's not going to do that\nif it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one."

aS"\nI'm not the only kid who grew up this way,\nsurrounded by people who used to say that rhyme\nabout sticks and stones,\nas if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called,\nand we got called them all.\nSo we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us,\nthat we'd be lonely forever,\nthat we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun\nwas something they built for us in their toolshed.\nSo broken heartstrings bled the blues, and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.\nDon't tell me that hurt less than a broken bone,\nthat an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away,\nthat there's no way for it to metastasize; it does."

aS'\nWe weren\'t the only kids who grew up this way.\nTo this day, kids are still being called names.\nThe classics were, "Hey stupid," "Hey spaz."\nSeems like every school has an arsenal of names\ngetting updated every year,\nand if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear,\ndo they make a sound?\nAre they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck\non repeat when people say things like, "Kids can be cruel."\nEvery school was a big top circus tent,\nand the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers,\nfrom clowns to carnies, all of these miles ahead of who we were.\nWe were freaks -- lobster claw boys and bearded ladies,\noddities juggling depression and loneliness,\nplaying solitaire, spin the bottle,\ntrying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal,\nbut at night, while the others slept,\nwe kept walking the tightrope.\nIt was practice, and yes, some of us fell.\nBut I want to tell them that all of this\nis just debris left over when we finally decide to smash\nall the things we thought we used to be,\nand if you can\'t see anything beautiful about yourself,\nget a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer,\nbecause there\'s something inside you that made you keep trying\ndespite everyone who told you to quit.\nYou built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself.\nYou signed it, "They were wrong."\nBecause maybe you didn\'t belong to a group or a clique.\nMaybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything.\nMaybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,\nbecause how can you hold your ground\nif everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it?\nYou have to believe that they were wrong.\nThey have to be wrong.\nWhy else would we still be here?'

aa(lp3025
S"\nWell, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,\nthe functions and structure of the human brain.\nAnd I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.\nHere is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly\nyou can hold in the palm of your hand,\nand it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.\nIt can contemplate the meaning of infinity\nand it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.\nAnd this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,\nwhich I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,\nand hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens."
p3026
aS"\nOK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?\nI mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,\nlittle wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,\nand from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities\nthat we call human nature and human consciousness.\nHow does this happen?\nWell, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.\nOne approach, the one we use mainly,\nis to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,\nwhere there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.\nWhat then happens is not an across-the-board reduction\nin all your mental capacities,\na sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.\nWhat you get is a highly selective loss of one function,\nwith other functions being preserved intact,\nand this gives you some confidence in asserting\nthat that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.\nSo you can then map function onto structure,\nand then find out what the circuitry's doing\nto generate that particular function.\nSo that's what we're trying to do."
p3027
aS'\nSo let me give you a few striking examples of this.\nIn fact, I\'m giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.\nThe first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.\nIf you look at the first slide there,\nthat\'s the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --\nthe lobes that constitute the brain.\nAnd if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --\nyou can\'t see it there --\nis a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.\nAnd that\'s been called the face area in the brain,\nbecause when it\'s damaged, you can no longer recognize people\'s faces.\nYou can still recognize them from their voice\nand say, "Oh yeah, that\'s Joe,"\nbut you can\'t look at their face and know who it is, right?\nYou can\'t even recognize yourself in the mirror.\nI mean, you know it\'s you because you wink and it winks,\nand you know it\'s a mirror,\nbut you don\'t really recognize yourself as yourself.'
p3028
aS'\nOK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.\nBut there\'s another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,\nthat very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.\nThis is called the Capgras delusion,\nand that is a patient, who\'s otherwise completely normal,\nhas had a head injury, comes out of coma,\notherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother\nand says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,\nbut she\'s an impostor.\nShe\'s some other woman pretending to be my mother."\nNow, why does this happen?\nWhy would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent\nin all other respects, but when he sees his mother,\nhis delusion kicks in and says, it\'s not mother.'
p3029
aS'\nNow, the most common interpretation of this,\nwhich you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,\nis a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --\nand the same argument applies to women, by the way,\nbut I\'ll just talk about guys.\nWhen you\'re a little baby, a young baby,\nyou had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.\nThis is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.\nI\'m not saying I believe this,\nbut this is the standard Freudian view.\nAnd then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,\nand inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.\nThank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.\nAnd then what happens is,\nthere\'s a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,\nallowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,\nflaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably\nyou find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.\nAnd you say, "My God, if this is my mom,\nhow come I\'m being sexually turned on?\nShe\'s some other woman. She\'s an impostor."\nIt\'s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.'
p3030
aS'\nThis has never made much sense to me, this argument.\nIt\'s very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --\n(Laughter)\n-- but didn\'t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,\na patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.\n(Laughter)\nHe\'ll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,\nbut it\'s some other dog." Right?\nNow, you try using the Freudian explanation there.\n(Laughter)\nYou\'ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,\nor some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.'
p3031
aS"\nNow, what's really going on?\nSo, to explain this curious disorder,\nwe look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.\nNormally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,\ngo to the visual areas in the brain.\nThere are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,\nand after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure\ncalled the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.\nThere are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.\nYou can call it the face area of the brain, right?\nI talked about that earlier.\nNow, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?"
p3032
aS"\nBut from that area, the message cascades\ninto a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,\nthe emotional core of the brain,\nand that structure, called the amygdala,\ngauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.\nIs it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?\nOr is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,\nor a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --\nor a shoe, or something like that? OK?\nWhich you can completely ignore.\nSo if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,\nthe messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.\nYour heart starts beating faster.\nYou start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to\ncreate from muscular exertion.\nAnd that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm\nand measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.\nSo I can determine, when you're looking at something,\nwhether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?\nAnd I'll get to that in a minute."
p3033
aS'\nSo my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his --\nany object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,\nhowever, and it\'s processed in the fusiform gyrus,\nand you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,\nor your mother, for that matter, OK?\nAnd then the message cascades into the amygdala,\nand then goes down the autonomic nervous system.\nBut maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,\nthe emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.\nSo because the fusiform is intact,\nthe chap can still recognize his mother,\nand says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."\nBut because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,\nhe says, "But how come, if it\'s my mother, I don\'t experience a warmth?"\nOr terror, as the case may be? Right?\n(Laughter)\nAnd therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?\nThis can\'t be my mother.\nIt\'s some strange woman pretending to be my mother."'
p3034
aS"\nHow do you test this?\nWell, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,\nand measure your galvanic skin response,\nand show pictures on the screen,\nI can measure how you sweat when you see an object,\nlike a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.\nIf I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?\nAnd, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --\nI'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.\nYou don't even have to be Jewish.\n(Laughter)"
p3035
aS"\nNow, what happens if you show this patient?\nYou take the patient and show him pictures on the screen\nand measure his galvanic skin response.\nTables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,\nbut when you show him a picture of his mother,\nthe galvanic skin response is flat.\nThere's no emotional reaction to his mother,\nbecause that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.\nSo his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,\nhis emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --\nbut the wire from vision to emotions is cut\nand therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.\nIt's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:\ntake a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome\nand say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,\nthat, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation\nin terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain."
p3036
aS'\nBy the way, if this patient then goes,\nand mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --\nand he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"\nThere\'s no delusion through the phone.\nThen, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?\nYou look just like my mother." OK?\nThe reason is there\'s a separate pathway\ngoing from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,\nand that\'s not been cut by the accident.\nSo this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.\nWhen he sees her in person, he says it\'s an impostor.'
p3037
aS'\nOK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?\nIs it nature, genes, or is it nurture?\nAnd we approach this problem\nby considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.\nAnd you all know what a phantom limb is.\nWhen an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,\nor you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,\nit\'s now a serious problem --\nyou continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,\nand that\'s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.\nIn fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.\nBelieve it or not, even with internal viscera.\nI\'ve had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --\nwho have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps\nat the appropriate time of the month.\nAnd in fact, one student asked me the other day,\n"Do they get phantom PMS?"\n(Laughter)\nA subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven\'t pursued that.'
p3038
aS'\nOK, now the next question is,\nwhat can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?\nOne of the things we\'ve found was,\nabout half the patients with phantom limbs\nclaim that they can move the phantom.\nIt\'ll pat his brother on the shoulder,\nit\'ll answer the phone when it rings, it\'ll wave goodbye.\nThese are very compelling, vivid sensations.\nThe patient\'s not delusional.\nHe knows that the arm is not there,\nbut, nevertheless, it\'s a compelling sensory experience for the patient.\nBut however, about half the patients, this doesn\'t happen.\nThe phantom limb -- they\'ll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.\nIt\'s fixed in a clenched spasm and it\'s excruciatingly painful.\nIf only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."'
p3039
aS'\nNow, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?\nIt sounds like an oxymoron.\nBut when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,\nthese people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,\nthe original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.\nThe actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,\nwas cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.\nSo the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,\nin a sling for a few months or a year, and then,\nin a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,\nthe surgeon amputates the arm,\nand then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?\nAnd this is a serious clinical problem.\nPatients become depressed.\nSome of them are driven to suicide, OK?'
p3040
aS'\nSo, how do you treat this syndrome?\nNow, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?\nWhen I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,\nand the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,\nand the actual arm had been paralyzed,\nand lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,\nand this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.'
p3041
aS'\nWhy does this happen?\nWhen the arm was intact, but paralyzed,\nthe brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"\nbut it\'s getting visual feedback saying, "No."\nMove. No. Move. No. Move. No.\nAnd this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,\nand we call this learned paralysis, OK?\nThe brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,\nthat the mere command to move the arm\ncreates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.\nAnd then, when you\'ve amputated the arm,\nthis learned paralysis carries over into your body image\nand into your phantom, OK?'
p3042
aS"\nNow, how do you help these patients?\nHow do you unlearn the learned paralysis,\nso you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm\nof the phantom arm?\nWell, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,\nbut give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?\nMaybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.\nHow do you do that? Well, virtual reality.\nBut that costs millions of dollars.\nSo, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,\nbut don't tell my funding agencies.\n(Laughter)"
p3043
aS"\nOK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.\nYou have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,\nand then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.\nHe had his arm amputated 10 years ago.\nHe had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut\nand the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.\nHe had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.\nIt was a paralyzed phantom arm."
p3044
aS'\nSo he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,\nwhich I call a mirror box, right?\nAnd the patient puts his phantom left arm,\nwhich is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,\nand the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,\nand makes the same posture, the clenched posture,\nand looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?\nHe looks at the phantom being resurrected,\nbecause he\'s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,\nand it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.\n"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom --\nyour real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."\nHe\'s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?\nThat\'s obvious, but the astonishing thing is,\nthe patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,\nand the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."'
p3045
aS'\nAnd remember, my first patient who came in --\n(Applause)\n-- thank you. (Applause)\nMy first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,\nand I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."\nAnd he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."\nBut he\'s not stupid. He knows it\'s not real.\nHe knows it\'s a mirror reflection,\nbut it\'s a vivid sensory experience.\nNow, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."\nHe said, "Oh, I can\'t move my phantom. You know that. It\'s painful."\nI said, "Move your normal hand."\nAnd he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don\'t believe this!\nAnd my pain is being relieved." OK?\nAnd then I said, "Close your eyes."\nHe closes his eyes.\n"And move your normal hand."\n"Oh, nothing. It\'s clenched again."\n"OK, open your eyes."\n"Oh my God, oh my God, it\'s moving again!"\nSo, he was like a kid in a candy store.'
p3046
aS"\nSo, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis\nand the critical role of visual input,\nbut I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize\nfor getting somebody to move his phantom limb.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nIt's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.\n(Laughter)\nBut then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis\nthat you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --\nthere may be a learned component to this,\nwhich you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror."
p3047
aS'\nSo, I said, "Look, Derek" --\nwell, first of all, the guy can\'t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --\nI said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.\nMaybe, after a period of practice,\nyou can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,\nand start moving your paralyzed arm,\nand then, relieve yourself of pain."\nSo he said OK, and he took it home.\nI said, "Look, it\'s, after all, two dollars. Take it home."'
p3048
aS'\nSo, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,\nand he said, "Doctor, you\'re not going to believe this."\nI said, "What?"\nHe said, "It\'s gone."\nI said, "What\'s gone?"\nI thought maybe the mirror box was gone.\n(Laughter)\nHe said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I\'ve had for the last 10 years?\nIt\'s disappeared."\nAnd I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,\nI mean I\'ve changed this guy\'s body image,\nwhat about human subjects, ethics and all of that?\nAnd I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"\nHe said, "No, last three days, I\'ve not had a phantom arm\nand therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,\nno phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.\nBut the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,\nand your box doesn\'t reach."\n(Laughter)\n"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,\nso I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"\nHe thought I was some kind of magician.'
p3049
aS"\nNow, why does this happen?\nIt's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.\nIt's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.\nOn the other hand, there's no proprioception,\nmuscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?\nAnd your motor command saying there is an arm,\nand, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,\nthere is no phantom, there is no arm, right?\nIt goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.\nAnd when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears\nbecause you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.\nSo, that's the bonus."
p3050
aS'\nNow, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients\nby other groups in Helsinki,\nso it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,\nand indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.\nStroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,\nnothing you can do about it.\nBut, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,\nand maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.\nThis has also gone through clinical trials,\nhelping lots and lots of patients.'
p3051
aS"\nOK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,\nwhich is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.\nThis was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.\nHe was a cousin of Charles Darwin.\nHe pointed out that certain people in the population,\nwho are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:\nevery time they see a number, it's colored.\nFive is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,\nnine is indigo, OK?\nBear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.\nOr C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.\nC sharp is blue, F sharp is green,\nanother tone might be yellow, right?"

aS"\nWhy does this happen?\nThis is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,\na mingling of the senses.\nIn us, all the senses are distinct.\nThese people muddle up their senses.\nWhy does this happen?\nOne of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.\nSynesthesia runs in families,\nso Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.\nSecondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point\nabout the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --\nsynesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists\nand other creative people than in the general population.\nWhy would that be?\nI'm going to answer that question.\nIt's never been answered before."
p3053
aS"\nOK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?\nWell, there are many theories.\nOne theory is they're just crazy.\nNow, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.\nAnother theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?\nNow, there may be some truth to this,\nbecause it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.\n(Laughter)\nOK. Now, the third theory is that --\nwell, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?"
p3054
aS"\nSo, we found that the color area and the number area\nare right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.\nSo we said, there's some accidental cross wiring\nbetween color and numbers in the brain.\nSo, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,\nand that's why you get synesthesia.\nNow remember -- why does this happen?\nWhy would there be crossed wires in some people?\nRemember I said it runs in families?\nThat gives you the clue.\nAnd that is, there is an abnormal gene,\na mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring."
p3055
aS"\nIn all of us, it turns out\nwe are born with everything wired to everything else.\nSo, every brain region is wired to every other region,\nand these are trimmed down to create\nthe characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.\nSo, if there's a gene causing this trimming\nand if that gene mutates,\nthen you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.\nAnd if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.\nIf it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.\nSo far, so good."
p3056
aS'\nNow, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,\nso everything is cross-connected?\nWell, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,\nthe ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,\nlinking seemingly unrelated ideas,\nsuch as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."\nWell, you don\'t say, Juliet is the sun,\ndoes that mean she\'s a glowing ball of fire?\nI mean, schizophrenics do that, but it\'s a different story, right?\nNormal people say, she\'s warm like the sun,\nshe\'s radiant like the sun, she\'s nurturing like the sun.\nInstantly, you\'ve found the links.'
p3057
aS"\nNow, if you assume that this greater cross wiring\nand concepts are also in different parts of the brain,\nthen it's going to create a greater propensity\ntowards metaphorical thinking and creativity\nin people with synesthesia.\nAnd, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia\namong poets, artists and novelists.\nOK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.\nThe last demonstration -- can I take one minute?\n(Applause)"
p3058
aS"\nOK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.\nHere's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,\nA is A, B is B, C is C.\nDifferent shapes for different phonemes, right?\nHere, you've got Martian alphabet.\nOne of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba.\nWhich one is Kiki and which one is Buba?\nHow many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba? Raise your hands.\nWell, it's one or two mutants.\n(Laughter)\nHow many of you think that's Buba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.\nNinety-nine percent of you."
p3059
aS"\nNow, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?\nIt's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,\nmeaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,\nin your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,\nmimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.\nNow, this is very important, because what it's telling you\nis your brain is engaging in a primitive --\nit's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,\nbut these photons in your eye are doing this shape,\nand hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,\nbut the brain is able to extract the common denominator.\nIt's a primitive form of abstraction,\nand we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,\nbecause when that's damaged,\nthese people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki,\nbut they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor."
p3060
aS'\nIf you ask this guy, what -- "all that glitters is not gold,"\nwhat does that mean?"\nThe patient says, "Well, if it\'s metallic and shiny, it doesn\'t mean it\'s gold.\nYou have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"\nSo, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.\nSo, this area is about eight times the size in higher --\nespecially in humans -- as in lower primates.\nSomething very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,\nbecause it\'s the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,\nand it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.\nAnd I think it\'s a basis of many uniquely human abilities\nlike abstraction, metaphor and creativity.\nAll of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,\nwe scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,\nand by studying patients and asking the right questions.\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nSorry about that.\n(Laughter)'

aa(lp3062
S"\nWhen I was president of the American Psychological Association,\nthey tried to media-train me,\nand an encounter I had with CNN\nsummarizes what I'm going to be talking about today,\nwhich is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.\nThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them,\nI'm going to give you the eleventh."
p3063
aS'\nSo they came to me -- CNN -- and they said, "Professor Seligman,\nwould you tell us about the state of psychology today?\nWe\'d like to interview you about that." And I said, "Great."\nAnd she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."\nSo I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"\nAnd she said, "Well, one."'
p3064
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3065
aS'\nAnd cameras rolled, and she said, "Professor Seligman,\nwhat is the state of psychology today?"\n"Good."'
p3066
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3067
aS'\n"Cut. Cut. That won\'t do.\nWe\'d really better give you a longer sound bite."\n"Well, how many words do I get this time?" "I think, well, you get two.\nDoctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"\n"Not good."'
p3068
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3069
aS'\n"Look, Doctor Seligman,\nwe can see you\'re really not comfortable in this medium.\nWe\'d better give you a real sound bite.\nThis time you can have three words.\nProfessor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"\n"Not good enough." And that\'s what I\'m going to be talking about.'
p3070
aS'\nI want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good\nand how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.\nAnd by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology,\nabout entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.'
p3071
aS"\nSo, why was psychology good?\nWell, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.\nTen years ago, when I was on an airplane\nand I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did,\nthey'd move away from me.\nAnd because, quite rightly, they were saying\npsychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony.\nAnd now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me."
p3072
aS'\nAnd what was good about psychology,\nabout the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made,\nabout working in the disease model,\nabout what you mean by psychology,\nis that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable --\nit was entirely smoke and mirrors.\nAnd now, 14 of the disorders are treatable,\ntwo of them actually curable.'
p3073
aS'\nAnd the other thing that happened is that a science developed,\na science of mental illness.\nThat we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism --\nand measure them with rigor.\nThat we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.\nThat we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.\nWe could look across time at the same people --\npeople, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia --\nand ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are,\nand we could isolate third variables\nby doing experiments on the mental illnesses.'
p3074
aS"\nAnd best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years,\nto invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.\nAnd then we were able to test them rigorously,\nin random assignment, placebo controlled designs,\nthrow out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did."
p3075
aS"\nAnd the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years,\ncan actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.\nAnd I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it.\nBut what was not good, the consequences of that were three things."
p3076
aS'\nThe first was moral,\nthat psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers,\nthat our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.\nAnd we forgot that people made choices and decisions.\nWe forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.'
p3077
aS'\nThe second cost was that we forgot about you people.\nWe forgot about improving normal lives.\nWe forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,\nmore fulfilled, more productive. And "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.\nNo one works on that.'
p3078
aS'\nAnd the third problem about the disease model is,\nin our rush to do something about people in trouble,\nin our rush to do something about repairing damage,\nit never occurred to us to develop interventions\nto make people happier, positive interventions.'
p3079
aS"\nSo that was not good.\nAnd so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,\nMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology,\nwhich has three aims.\nThe first is that psychology should be just as concerned\nwith human strength as it is with weakness.\nIt should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.\nIt should be interested in the best things in life.\nAnd it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling,\nand with genius, with nurturing high talent."
p3080
aS"\nSo in the last 10 years and the hope for the future,\nwe've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology,\na science of what makes life worth living.\nIt turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.\nAnd any of you, for free, can go to that website\nand take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.\nYou can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning,\nfor flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?\nWe created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities:\na classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,\nhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,\nwhat builds them and what gets in their way.\nWe found that we could discover the causation of the positive states,\nthe relationship between left hemispheric activity\nand right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness."
p3081
aS"\nI've spent my life working on extremely miserable people,\nand I've asked the question,\nhow do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?\nAnd starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.\nAnd how do they differ from the rest of us?\nAnd it turns out there's one way.\nThey're not more religious, they're not in better shape,\nthey don't have more money, they're not better looking,\nthey don't have more good events and fewer bad events.\nThe one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.\nThey don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.\n(Laughter)\nThey don't spend time alone.\nEach of them is in a romantic relationship\nand each has a rich repertoire of friends."
p3082
aS"\nBut watch out here. This is merely correlational data, not causal,\nand it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about:\nhappiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.\nAnd I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment.\nWe found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries,\nfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.\nAbout 120 interventions have been proposed\nthat allegedly make people happy.\nAnd we find that we've been able to manualize many of them,\nand we actually carry out random assignment\nefficacy and effectiveness studies.\nThat is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?\nIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results."
p3083
aS"\nBut the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have,\nin addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill,\nand in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable,\nis can psychology actually make people happier?\nAnd to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much --\nwe've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.\nAnd I believe there are three different --\nand I call them different because different interventions build them,\nit's possible to have one rather than the other --\nthree different happy lives.\nThe first happy life is the pleasant life.\nThis is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can,\nand the skills to amplify it.\nThe second is a life of engagement --\na life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.\nThat's what Aristotle was talking about.\nAnd third, the meaningful life.\nSo I want to say a little bit about each of those lives\nand what we know about them."
p3084
aS"\nThe first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it,\nit's having as many of the pleasures as you can,\nas much positive emotion as you can,\nand learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them,\nthat stretch them over time and space.\nBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,\nand it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here."
p3085
aS"\nThe first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life,\nyour experience of positive emotion, is heritable,\nabout 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.\nSo the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know\nabout increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life\nare 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.\nSecond is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed.\nIt's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent;\nby the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.\nAnd, as I said, it's not particularly malleable."
p3086
aS"\nAnd this leads to the second life.\nAnd I have to tell you about my friend, Len,\nto talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,\nmore than building pleasure.\nIn two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,\nLen was enormously successful. The first arena was work.\nBy the time he was 20, he was an options trader.\nBy the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire\nand the head of an options trading company.\nSecond, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.\nBut in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.\nAnd the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.\n(Laughter)"
p3087
aS'\nLen is an introvert.\nAmerican women said to Len, when he dated them,\n"You\'re no fun. You don\'t have positive emotion. Get lost."\nAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,\nwho for five years tried to find the sexual trauma\nthat had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.\nBut it turned out there wasn\'t any sexual trauma.\nIt turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island\nand he played football and watched football, and played bridge --\nLen is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.'
p3088
aS"\nThe question is, is Len unhappy? And I want to say not.\nContrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent\nof the human race in positive affectivity,\nI think Len is one of the happiest people I know.\nHe's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness\nand that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.\nWhen he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning,\ntime stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell.\nWhen the first card is played,\nuntil 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len."
p3089
aS"\nAnd this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about,\nabout flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.\nPleasure has raw feels: you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling.\nBut what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.\nYou're one with the music. Time stops.\nYou have intense concentration.\nAnd this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.\nAnd we think there's a recipe for it,\nand it's knowing what your highest strengths are.\nAnd again, there's a valid test\nof what your five highest strengths are.\nAnd then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.\nRe-crafting your work, your love,\nyour play, your friendship, your parenting."
p3090
aS"\nJust one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.\nHated the job.\nShe's working her way through college.\nHer highest strength was social intelligence,\nso she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her\nthe social highlight of every customer's day.\nNow obviously she failed.\nBut what she did was to take her highest strengths,\nand re-craft work to use them as much as possible.\nWhat you get out of that is not smiley-ness.\nYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.\nYou don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.\nSo, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion.\nThe second path is eudaimonian flow."
p3091
aS'\nAnd the third path is meaning.\nThis is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.\nAnd meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia --\nit consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them\nto belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.'
p3092
aS"\nI mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life,\nthe good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question,\nare there things that lastingly change those lives?\nAnd the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it.\nIt's being done in a rigorous manner.\nIt's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.\nSo we do random assignment, placebo controlled,\nlong-term studies of different interventions.\nAnd just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect,\nwhen we teach people about the pleasant life,\nhow to have more pleasure in your life,\none of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills,\nand you're assigned to design a beautiful day.\nNext Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day,\nand use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.\nAnd we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced."
p3093
aS"\nGratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would.\nClose your eyes.\nI'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important\nthat changed your life in a good direction,\nand who you never properly thanked.\nThe person has to be alive. OK.\nNow, OK, you can open your eyes.\nI hope all of you have such a person.\nYour assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit,\nis to write a 300-word testimonial to that person,\ncall them on the phone in Phoenix,\nask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door,\nyou read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.\nAnd what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later,\nthree months later, they're both happier and less depressed."
p3094
aS"\nAnother example is a strength date, in which we get couples\nto identify their highest strengths on the strengths test,\nand then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths,\nand we find this is a strengthener of relationships.\nAnd fun versus philanthropy.\nBut it's so heartening to be in a group like this,\nin which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.\nWell, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this,\nso we actually have people do something altruistic\nand do something fun, and to contrast it.\nAnd what you find is when you do something fun,\nit has a square wave walk set.\nWhen you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.\nSo those are examples of positive interventions."
p3095
aS"\nSo, the next to last thing I want to say is\nwe're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.\nAnd this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable.\nAnd we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,\nhow much life satisfaction do you get?\nSo we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people --\nto what extent does the pursuit of pleasure,\nthe pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life,\nthe pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you,\nand the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?"
p3096
aS"\nAnd our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.\nIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.\nThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.\nThe pursuit of engagement is also very strong.\nWhere pleasure matters is if you have both engagement\nand you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.\nWhich is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.\nConversely, if you have none of the three,\nthe empty life, the sum is less than the parts."
p3097
aS"\nAnd what we're asking now is\ndoes the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity,\nhow long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?\nThat is, in a corporation,\nis productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?\nIs health a function of positive engagement,\nof pleasure, and of meaning in life?\nAnd there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes."
p3098
aS"\nSo, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard,\nand so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this.\nI've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much,\nwhich was one of the remarkable things.\nBut I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel\nto the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.\nWe all know that technology, entertainment and design\nhave been and can be used for destructive purposes.\nWe also know that technology, entertainment and design\ncan be used to relieve misery.\nAnd by the way, the distinction between relieving misery\nand building happiness is extremely important.\nI thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago,\nthat if I was good enough to make someone not depressed,\nnot anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.\nAnd I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero.\nBut they were empty."
p3099
aS"\nAnd it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life,\nthe skills of engagement, the skills of meaning,\nare different from the skills of relieving misery.\nAnd so, the parallel thing holds\nwith technology, entertainment and design, I believe.\nThat is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world\nto increase happiness, to increase positive emotion,\nand that's typically how they've been used.\nBut once you fractionate happiness the way I do --\nnot just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough --\nthere's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.\nAs Laura Lee told us,\ndesign, and, I believe, entertainment and technology,\ncan be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well."
p3100
aS"\nSo in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism,\nin addition to the space elevator,\nis that I think with technology, entertainment and design,\nwe can actually increase the amount of tonnage\nof human happiness on the planet.\nAnd if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life,\nthe good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.\nIf entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion,\nmeaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.\nAnd if design can increase positive emotion,\neudaimonia, and flow and meaning,\nwhat we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you.\n(Applause)"

S"\nThank you so much. It's really scary to be here\namong the smartest of the smart.\nI'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.\nThere's a Jewish saying that I love.\nWhat is truer than truth? Answer: The story.\nI'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth\nabout our common humanity.\nAll stories interest me, and some haunt me\nuntil I end up writing them.\nCertain themes keep coming up:\njustice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,\nfreedom.\nI'm aware of the mystery around us,\nso I write about coincidences, premonitions,\nemotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic."
p3103
aS"\nIn the last 20 years I have published a few books,\nbut I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,\nwhen I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.\nThat made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,\nand my grandchildren think that I'm cool.\n(Laughter)\nAllow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.\nOne of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,\nof the opening ceremony,\ncalled me and said that I had been selected\nto be one of the flag-bearers.\nI replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity\nbecause I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.\nActually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium\nwithout a walker.\n(Laughter)\nI was told that this was no laughing matter.\nThis would be the first time\nthat only women would carry the Olympic flag.\nFive women, representing five continents,\nand three Olympic gold medal winners.\nMy first question was, naturally,\nwhat was I going to wear?\n(Laughter)\nA uniform, she said,\nand asked for my measurements.\nMy measurements.\nI had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,\nlooking like the Michelin Man.\n(Laughter)"
p3104
aS"\nBy the middle of February,\nI found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds\ncheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.\nThose athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.\nThey all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.\nA speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,\ncan determine the result of a race or a game.\nHowever, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.\nOnly a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.\nIt is all about passion.\nThe streets of Turin were covered with red posters\nannouncing the slogan of the Olympics."
p3105
aS"\nPassion lives here. Isn't it always true?\nHeart is what drives us and determines our fate.\nThat is what I need for my characters in my books:\na passionate heart.\nI need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,\nwho ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.\nPeople like all of you in this room.\nNice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.\n(Laughter)\nThey only make good former spouses.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)"
p3106
aS'\nIn the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:\nthree athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.\nAlso, two women with passionate hearts:\nWangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya\nwho has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,\nshe has changed the soil, the weather,\nin some places in Africa, and of course\nthe economic conditions in many villages.\nAnd Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately\nagainst child prostitution.\nWhen she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.\nShe told us of little girls raped by men who believe that\nhaving sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.\nAnd of brothels where children are forced to receive five,\n15 clients per day,\nand if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.\nIn the green room I received my uniform.\nIt was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,\nbut it was far from the Michelin Man suit\nthat I had anticipated. Not bad, really.\nI looked like a refrigerator.\n(Laughter)\nBut so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,\nthe universal symbol of beauty and passion.\nSophia is over 70 and she looks great.\nShe\'s sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.\nNow, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?\nI don\'t know.\nWhen asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"\nShe replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,\nand I don\'t make old people\'s noises."\n(Laughter)\nSo, there you have some free advice\nfrom one of the most beautiful women on earth.\nNo grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,\nno talking to yourselves, no farting.\n(Laughter)\nWell, she didn\'t say that exactly.\n(Laughter)'
p3107
aS"\nAt some point around midnight,\nwe were summoned to the wings of the stadium,\nand the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --\nby the way, the same music that starts here,\nthe Aida March.\nSophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,\nnot counting the poofy hair.\n(Laughter)\nShe walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,\nholding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind\n(Laughter)\n-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,\nso that my head was actually under the damn flag.\n(Laughter)\nAll the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.\nThat was fortunate for me, because in most press photos\nI appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.\n(Laughter)\nA place where most men would love to be.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)"

aS"\nI want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --\npassion.\nSo here's a tale of passion.\nThe year is 1998, the place is a prison camp\nfor Tutsi refugees in Congo.\nBy the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world\nare women and girls.\nWe can call this place in Congo a death camp,\nbecause those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.\nThe protagonists of this story\nare a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.\nShe's pregnant and a widow.\nSoldiers have forced her to watch\nas her husband was tortured and killed.\nSomehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,\nand a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.\nTwo tiny little boys.\nShe cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,\nand ties it with her own hair.\nShe names the twins after the camp's commanders\nto gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea\nbecause her milk cannot sustain them.\nWhen the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,\nshe grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,\neven when they hold a gun to her head.\nSomehow, the family survives for 16 months,\nand then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart\nof a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,\nwho manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,\nRose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,\nwhere they're now living and thriving."

aS"\nMapendo, in Swahili, means great love.\nThe protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women\nlike Rose Mapendo.\nI don't make them up. There's no need for that.\nI look around and I see them everywhere.\nI have worked with women and for women all my life.\nI know them well.\nI was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,\nin a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.\nNo wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --\nalthough the term had not reached Chile yet,\nso nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.\n(Laughter)\nI would soon find out that there was a high price to pay\nfor my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.\nBut I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,\nI was able to deliver two.\n(Laughter)\nOnce, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,\nshe said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.\nWe had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?\nYes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,\nbut not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world\nwho are still forced into premature marriage,\nprostitution, forced labor --\nthey have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.\nThey have no control over their bodies or their lives.\nThey have no education and no freedom.\nThey are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.\nFor most Western young women of today,\nbeing called a feminist is an insult.\nFeminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you\nthat it never stopped me from flirting,\nand I have seldom suffered from lack of men.\n(Laughter)\nFeminism is not dead, by no means.\nIt has evolved. If you don't like the term,\nchange it, for Goddess' sake.\nCall it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;\nthe name doesn't matter,\nas long as we understand what it is about, and we support it."

p3112
aS"\nMillions of women live like this today.\nThey are the poorest of the poor.\nAlthough women do two-thirds of the world's labor,\nthey own less than one percent of the world's assets.\nThey are paid less than men for the same work\nif they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable\nbecause they have no economic independence,\nand they are constantly threatened by exploitation,\nviolence and abuse.\nIt is a fact that giving women education, work,\nthe ability to control their own income,\ninherit and own property, benefits the society.\nIf a woman is empowered,\nher children and her family will be better off.\nIf families prosper, the village prospers,\nand eventually so does the whole country."
p3113
aS"\nWangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.\nShe talks with the women and explains that the land is barren\nbecause they have cut and sold the trees.\nShe gets the women to plant new trees and water them,\ndrop by drop.\nIn a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,\nthe soil is enriched, and the village is saved.\nThe poorest and most backward societies\nare always those that put women down.\nYet this obvious truth is ignored by governments\nand also by philanthropy.\nFor every dollar given to a women's program,\n20 dollars are given to men's programs.\nWomen are 51 percent of humankind.\nEmpowering them will change everything --\nmore than technology and design and entertainment.\nI can promise you that women working together --\nlinked, informed and educated --\ncan bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.\nIn any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,\nmainly women and children.

p3114
aS"\nWhat kind of world do we want?\nThis is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.\nDoes it make sense to participate in the existing world order?\nWe want a world where life is preserved\nand the quality of life is enriched for everybody,\nnot only for the privileged.\nIn January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings\nat the UC Berkeley library.\nNo museum or gallery in the United States,\nexcept for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,\nhas dared to show the paintings because the theme\nis the Abu Ghraib prison.\nThey are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,\nin the voluminous Botero style.\nI have not been able to get those images out of my mind\nor my heart.\nWhat I fear most is power with impunity.\nI fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.\nIn our species, the alpha males define reality,\nand force the rest of the pack to accept that reality\nand follow the rules.\nThe rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,\nand in this case, the trickle-down effect,\nwhich does not work in economics, works perfectly.\nAbuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.\nWomen and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.\nEven the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --\na woman or a child.\nI'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many\nthrough gender, income, race, and class."

aS"\nI think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes\nin our civilization.\nBut for real change, we need feminine energy\nin the management of the world.\nWe need a critical number of women in positions of power,\nand we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.\nI'm talking about men with young minds, of course.\nOld guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.\n(Laughter)\nYes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs\nand legendary breasts.\nBut given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts\nof Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.\nI want to make this world good.\nNot better, but to make it good.\nWhy not?

aa(lp3117
S"\nIn the year 1919,\na virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza\nsuggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.\nHe proposed that our universe\nmight actually have more than the three dimensions\nthat we are all aware of.\nThat is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,\nKaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space\nthat for some reason we don't yet see.\nNow, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,\nsometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,\nbut it has nothing to do with the world around us.\nThis particular idea, however --\nalthough we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,\nand at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,\nmay tell us whether it's right or wrong --\nthis idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century\nand continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research."
p3118
aS"\nSo, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.\nSo where do we go?\nTo begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.\nThis is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow\nof having discovered the special theory of relativity\nand decides to take on a new project,\nto try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.\nAnd in that moment, there are many people around\nwho thought that that project had already been resolved.\nNewton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s\nthat works well, describes the motion of planets,\nthe motion of the moon and so forth,\nthe motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,\nhitting people on the head.\nAll of that could be described using Newton's work."
p3119
aS"\nBut Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,\nbecause even Newton had written\nthat although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,\nhe'd been unable to figure out how it really works.\nHow is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,\n[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?\nHow does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?\nAnd that is a task to which Einstein set himself --\nto figure out how gravity works.\nAnd let me show you what it is that he found.\nSo Einstein found\nthat the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.\nThe idea goes like this:\nimagine space is a substrate of all there is."
p3120
aS"\nEinstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.\nBut if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,\nit causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.\nAnd that communicates the force of gravity.\nEven the Earth warps space around it.\nNow look at the Moon.\nThe Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,\nbecause it rolls along a valley in the curved environment\nthat the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.\nWe go to a full-frame view of this.\nThe Earth itself is kept in orbit\nbecause it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved\nbecause of the Sun's presence.\nThat is this new idea about how gravity actually works."
p3121
aS"\nNow, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.\nIt really works. It describes the data.\nAnd this gained Einstein prominence around the world.\nAnd that is what got Kaluza thinking.\nHe, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.\nThat's one theory\nthat might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,\none set of principles, one master equation, if you will.\nSo Kaluza said to himself,\nEinstein has been able to describe gravity\nin terms of warps and curves in space --\nin fact, space and time, to be more precise.\nMaybe I can play the same game with the other known force,\nwhich was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --\nwe know of others today, but at that time\nthat was the only other one people were thinking about.\nYou know, the force responsible for electricity\nand magnetic attraction and so forth."
p3122
aS'\nSo Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game\nand describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.\nThat raised a question: warps and curves in what?\nEinstein had already used up space and time,\nwarps and curves, to describe gravity.\nThere didn\'t seem to be anything else to warp or curve.\nSo Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.\nHe said, if I want to describe one more force,\nmaybe I need one more dimension.\nSo he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,\nand imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves\nin that fourth dimension. Now here\'s the thing:\nwhen he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves\nin a universe with four space dimensions, not three,\nhe found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --\nthose were for gravity --\nbut he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.\nAnd when he looked at that equation,\nit was none other than the equation\nthat scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.\nAmazing -- it just popped out.\nHe was so excited by this realization\nthat he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --\nthat he had found the unified theory.'
p3123
aS"\nNow clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.\nHe, in fact --\nthere is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,\nhe read a book, a treatise on swimming --\n(Laughter)\n-- then dove into the ocean.\nThis is a man who would risk his life on theory.\nNow, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,\ntwo questions immediately arise from his observation.\nNumber one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?\nWe don't seem to see them.\nAnd number two: does this theory really work in detail,\nwhen you try to apply it to the world around us?\nNow, the first question was answered in 1926\nby a fellow named Oskar Klein.\nHe suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --\nthere might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,\nbut there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,\ncurled up so small, even though they're all around us,\nthat we don't see them."
p3124
aS"\nLet me show you that one visually.\nSo, imagine you're looking at something\nlike a cable supporting a traffic light.\nIt's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --\nbut the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,\nbut you and I all know that it does have some thickness.\nIt's very hard to see it, though, from far away.\nBut if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,\na little ant walking around --\nlittle ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --\nthe long dimension,\nbut also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.\nAnd I hope you appreciate this.\nIt took so long to get these ants to do this."
p3125
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3126
aS"\nBut this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:\nbig and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us\nare the ones that we can easily see,\nbut there might be additional dimensions curled up,\nsort of like the circular part of that cable,\nso small that they have so far remained invisible.\nLet me show you what that would look like.\nSo, if we take a look, say, at space itself --\nI can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.\nSome of you guys will fix that one day,\nbut anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,\ngoes smaller, smaller, smaller,\nand way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,\nthis is the idea,\nyou could have additional curled up dimensions --"
p3127
aS"\nhere is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.\nBut if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,\nyou could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --\nthat's like the grid part --\nbut you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension\nthat's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye\nor even with any of our most refined equipment.\nBut deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,\nthe idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.\nNow that's an explanation\nabout how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.\nBut what about the second question that I asked:\ndoes the theory actually work\nwhen you try to apply it to the real world?"
p3128
aS"\nWell, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others\nworked on trying to refine this framework\nand apply it to the physics of the universe\nas was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.\nIn detail, for instance,\nthey couldn't get the mass of the electron\nto work out correctly in this theory.\nSo many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,\nthis strange but very compelling idea\nof how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.\nUntil something wonderful happened in our age.\nIn our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics\nis being pursued by physicists such as myself,\nmany others around the world,\nit's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.\nAnd the wonderful thing is that superstring theory\nhas nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,\nbut when we study superstring theory,\nwe find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form."
p3129
aS"\nSo, let me just tell you how that goes.\nSuperstring theory -- what is it?\nWell, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:\nwhat are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents\nmaking up everything in the world around us?\nThe idea is like this.\nSo, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,\nand imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.\nSo we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.\nSo deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.\nWe also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.\nThey have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus\nwith neutrons and protons.\nEven the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.\nThat is where conventional ideas stop."
p3130
aS"\nHere is the new idea of string theory.\nDeep inside any of these particles, there is something else.\nThis something else is this dancing filament of energy.\nIt looks like a vibrating string --\nthat's where the idea, string theory comes from.\nAnd just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello\ncan vibrate in different patterns,\nthese can also vibrate in different patterns.\nThey don't produce different musical notes.\nRather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.\nSo if these ideas are correct,\nthis is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.\nIt's built up of a huge number\nof these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,\nvibrating in different frequencies.\nThe different frequencies produce the different particles.\nThe different particles are responsible\nfor all the richness in the world around us."
p3131
aS"\nAnd there you see unification,\nbecause matter particles, electrons and quarks,\nradiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.\nSo matter and the forces of nature all are put together\nunder the rubric of vibrating strings.\nAnd that's what we mean by a unified theory.\nNow here is the catch.\nWhen you study the mathematics of string theory,\nyou find that it doesn't work\nin a universe that just has three dimensions of space.\nIt doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.\nFinally, you can study the equations, and show that it works\nonly in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space\nand one dimension of time.\nIt leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --\nthat our world, when appropriately described,\nhas more dimensions than the ones that we see."
p3132
aS"\nNow you might think about that and say, well,\nOK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,\nyeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.\nBut if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,\nand you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.\nOne of the other predictions of string theory --\nno, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory."
p3133
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3134
aS"\nBut it raises the question:\nare we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,\nor do they tell us something about the world?\nIn the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.\nFirst is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions\nhold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question\nin theoretical physics, theoretical science.\nAnd that question is this: when we look around the world,\nas scientists have done for the last hundred years,\nthere appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.\nThese are numbers like the mass of the particles,\nlike electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,\nthe strength of the electromagnetic force --\na list of about 20 numbers\nthat have been measured with incredible precision,\nbut nobody has an explanation\nfor why the numbers have the particular values that they do."
p3135
aS"\nNow, does string theory offer an answer?\nNot yet.\nBut we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do\nmay rely on the form of the extra dimensions.\nAnd the wonderful thing is, if those numbers\nhad any other values than the known ones,\nthe universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.\nThis is a deep question.\nWhy are those numbers so finely tuned\nto allow stars to shine and planets to form,\nwhen we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --\nif I had 20 dials up here\nand I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,\nalmost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.\nSo can we explain those 20 numbers?\nAnd string theory suggests that those 20 numbers\nhave to do with the extra dimensions.\nLet me show you how.\nSo when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,\nit's not one extra dimension,\nas in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.\nThis is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.\nThey have a very rich, intertwined geometry."
p3136
aS"\nThis is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --\nname isn't all that important.\nBut, as you can see,\nthe extra dimensions fold in on themselves\nand intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.\nAnd the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,\nthen the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us\nwould look like this on the tiniest of scales.\nWhen you swing your hand,\nyou'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,\nbut they're so small that we wouldn't know it.\nSo what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?"
p3137
aS"\nConsider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,\nnotice that the vibrations of the airstreams\nare affected by the shape of the instrument.\nNow in string theory,\nall the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.\nSo just as those airstreams\nare affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,\nstrings themselves will be affected\nby the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.\nSo let me bring some strings into the story.\nAnd if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --\nthey'll be there in a second -- right there,\nnotice that they way they vibrate is affected\nby the geometry of the extra dimensions."
p3138
aS"\nSo, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --\nwe don't yet, but if we did --\nwe should be able to calculate the allowed notes,\nthe allowed vibrational patterns.\nAnd if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,\nwe should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.\nAnd if the answer that we get from our calculations\nagrees with the values of those numbers\nthat have been determined\nthrough detailed and precise experimentation,\nthis in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation\nfor why the structure of the universe is the way it is.\nNow, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:\nhow might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?\nIs this just an interesting mathematical structure\nthat might be able to explain\nsome previously unexplained features of the world,\nor can we actually test for these extra dimensions?\nAnd we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --\nthat in the next five years or so we may be able to test\nfor the existence of these extra dimensions."
p3139
aS"\nHere's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,\na machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.\nIt's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,\nopposite directions, near the speed of light.\nEvery so often those particles will be aimed at each other,\nso there's a head-on collision.\nThe hope is that if the collision has enough energy,\nit may eject some of the debris from the collision\nfrom our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.\nHow would we know it?\nWell, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,\ncompare it to the amount of energy before,\nand if there's less energy after the collision than before,\nthis will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.\nAnd if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,\nthis will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there."
p3140
aS"\nLet me show you that idea visually.\nSo, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --\nthat's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,\nif the extra dimensions are real.\nBut here's how the experiment will go.\nYou take these particles. You slam them together.\nYou slam them together, and if we are right,\nsome of the energy of that collision\nwill go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.\nSo this is the kind of experiment\nthat we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.\nAnd if this experiment bears fruit,\nif we see that kind of particle ejected\nby noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions\nthan when we began,\nthis will show that the extra dimensions are real."
p3141
aS"\nAnd to me this is a really remarkable story,\nand a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --\ndidn't provide anything but an arena, a stage\nin which the events of the universe take place.\nEinstein comes along and says,\nwell, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.\nAnd now string theory comes along and says,\nyes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,\nall together in one package,\nbut only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.\nAnd this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.\nAmazing possibility.\nThank you very much."

aS'\nBut the fact is, there\'s good people everywhere.\nThat\'s what I try and show in my stand-up. There\'s good people everywhere.\nAll it takes in one person to mess it up.\nLike a couple months ago in Times Square in New York,\nthere was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.\nNow, I happened to be in Times Square that night\ndoing a comedy show.\nAnd a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas\nwho flew his airplane into the IRS building,\nand I happened to be in Austin that day\ndoing a stand-up comedy show.\nNow I\'ll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male,\nwhen you show up around a lot of these activities,\nyou start feeling guilty at one point.\nI was watching the news. I\'m like, "Am I involved in this crap?"\n(Laughter)\n"I didn\'t get the memo. What\'s going on?"'
p3149
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3150
aS'\nBut what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy --\nsee he gives a bad name to Muslims\nand Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.\nAnd one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban\ntook credit for that failed car bombing.\nMy question is: why would you take credit\nfor a failed car bombing?\n"We just wanted to say\nwe tried."\n(Laughter)\n"And furthermore,\nit is the thought that counts."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\n"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."\n(Laughter)\nBut what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building,\nI know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States\nwere watching TV, going, "Please, don\'t be Middle Eastern.\nDon\'t be Hassan. Don\'t be Hussein."\nAnd the name came out Jack. I\'m like, "Woooo!\nThat\'s not one of us."\nBut I kept watching the news in case they came back,\nthey were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."\n"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"'
p3151
aS'\nBut the fact is, I\'ve been lucky\nto get a chance to perform all over the world,\nand I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.\nI just did a seven-country solo tour.\nI was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.\nI was in Dubai.\nAnd it\'s great, there\'s good people everywhere.\nAnd you learn great things about these places.\nI encourage people always to go visit these places.\nFor example, Dubai -- cool place.\nThey\'re obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.\nThey have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.\nIt is so big, they have taxis in the mall.\nI was walking. I heard "Beep, beep."\nI\'m like, "What are you doing here?"\nHe goes, "I\'m going to the Zara store. It\'s three miles away.\nOut of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."\nAnd what\'s crazy -- there\'s a recession going on, even in Dubai,\nbut you wouldn\'t know by the prices.\nLike in the Dubai Mall,\nthey sell frozen yogurt by the gram.\nIt\'s like a drug deal.\nI was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst. Habibi, my friend."\n(Laughter)\n"You want some frozen yogurt?\nCome here. Come here. Come here.\nI have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?"\n(Laughter)\nI bought five grams. 10 dollars. 10 dollars! I said, "What\'s in this?"\nHe\'s like, "Good stuff, man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line."'
p3152
aS'\nThe other thing you learn sometimes\nwhen you travel to these countries in the Middle East,\nsometimes in Latin American countries, South American countries --\na lot of times when they build stuff,\nthere\'s no rules and regulations.\nFor example, I took my two year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.\nAnd I\'ve taken my two year-old son to playgrounds all over the United States.\nAnd when you put your two year-old on a slide in the United States,\nthey put something on the slide\nto slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.\nNot in the Middle East.\n(Laughter)\nI put my two year-old on the slide; he went frrmrmm! He took off.\nI went down. I go, "Where\'s my son?"\n"On the third floor, sir. On the third floor."\n(Laughter)\n"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."\n(Laughter)\n"Try the yogurt. It\'s very good. Little expensive."'
p3153
aS'\nBut one of the things I try to do with my stand-up is to break stereotypes.\nAnd I\'ve been guilty of stereotyping as well.\nI was in Dubai. And there\'s a lot of Indians who work in Dubai.\nAnd they don\'t get paid that well.\nAnd I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers.\nAnd I forgot there\'s obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well.\nI was doing a show,\nand they said, "We\'re going to send a driver to pick you up."\nSo I went down to the lobby, and I saw this Indian guy.\nI go, "He\'s got to be my driver."\nBecause he was standing there in like a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.\nSo I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?"\nHe goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."\n(Laughter)\nI go, "I\'m sorry. Then why were you staring at me?"\nHe goes, "I thought you were my driver."'
p3154
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3155
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3156
aS'\nI\'ll leave you guys with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,\npresent Middle Easterners in a positive light -- Muslims in a positive light --\nand I hope that in the coming years,\nmore film and television programs come out of Hollywood\npresenting us in a positive light.\nWho knows, maybe one day we\'ll even have our own James Bond, right.\n"My name is Bond, Jamal Bond."'
p3157
aS'\n(Laughter)'

aa(lp3161
S"\nI want to discuss with you this afternoon\nwhy you're going to fail to have a great career. (Laughter)"
p3162
aS"\nI'm an economist. I do dismal.\nEnd of the day, it's ready for dismal remarks.\nI only want to talk to those of you who want a great career.\nI know some of you have already decided\nyou want a good career.\nYou're going to fail, too (Laughter) \nbecause  Goodness, you're all cheery about failing. (Laughter)\nCanadian group, undoubtedly. (Laughter)\nThose trying to have good careers are going to fail,\nbecause, really, good jobs are now disappearing.\nThere are great jobs and great careers,\nand then there are the high-workload, high-stress,\nbloodsucking, soul-destroying kinds of jobs,\nand practically nothing in between."
p3163
aS'\nSo the people looking for good jobs are going to fail.\nI\'m going to talk about those looking for great jobs, great\ncareers, and why you\'re going to, why you\'re going to fail.\nFirst reason is that no matter how many times people tell you,\n"If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion,\nyou have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue,\nthe greatest fascination in your life,"\nyou hear it again and again and then you decide\nnot to do it. It doesn\'t matter how many times you download\nSteven J.\'s Stanford commencement address,\nyou still look at it and decide not to do it.'
p3164
aS"\nI'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it.\nYou're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.\nYou're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it,\nyou'll feel like you're an idiot, so then you make excuses\nabout why you're not going to look for your passion.\nAnd they are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.\nWe're going to go through a whole long list, your creativity,\nand thinking of excuses not to do what you really\nneed to do if you want to have a great career."
p3165
aS'\nSo, for example, one of your great excuses is,\n"Well, great careers are really and truly, for most people,\njust a matter of luck, so I\'m going to stand around,\nI\'m going to try to be lucky, and if I\'m lucky,\nI\'ll have a great career. If not, I\'ll have a good career."\nBut a good career is an impossibility, so that\'s not going to work.'
p3166
aS'\nThen, your other excuse is, "Yes, there are special people\nwho pursue their passions, but they are geniuses.\nThey are Steven J. I\'m not a genius.\nWhen I was five, I thought I was a genius,\nbut my professors have beaten that idea\nout of my head long since." (Laughter) Mm?\n"And now I know I am completely competent."\nNow, you see, if this was 1950,\nbeing completely competent,\nthat would have given you a great career.\nBut guess what? This is almost 2012, and saying\nto the world, "I am totally, completely competent,"\nis damning yourself with the faintest of praise.'
p3167
aS'\nAnd then, of course, another excuse:\n"Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but,\nwell, after all, I\'m not weird.\nEverybody knows that people who pursue their passions\nare somewhat obsessive. A little strange? Mm? Mm? Okay?\nYou know, a fine line between madness and genius.\nI\'m not weird. I\'ve read Steven J.\'s biography.\nOh my goodness. I am not that person. I am nice.\nI am normal. I\'m a nice, normal person,\nand nice, normal people\ndon\'t have passion.\nAh. But I still want a great career.\nI\'m not prepared to pursue my passion, so I know\nwhat I\'m going to do, because I have, I have a solution,\nI have a strategy.\nIt\'s the one Mommy and Daddy told me about.\nMommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard,\nI\'d have a good career. So, if you work hard\nand have a good career, if you work really, really, really hard,\nyou\'ll have a great career. Doesn\'t that, like,\nmathematically make sense?"\nHmm. Not. (Laughter)\nBut you\'ve managed to talk yourself into that.'
p3168
aS"\nYou know what? Here's a little secret.\nYou want to work? You want to work really, really, really hard?\nYou know what? You'll succeed. The world will give you\nthe opportunity to work really, really, really, really hard,\nbut are you so sure that that's going to give you\na great career when all the evidence is to the contrary?"
p3169
aS"\nSo let's assume, let's deal with those of you\nwho are trying to find your passion.\nYou actually understand that you really had better do it,\nnever mind the excuses. You're trying to find your passion,\nand you're so happy.\nYou found something you're interested in."
p3170
aS'\nI have an interest! I have an interest! You tell me.\nYou say, "I have an interest!" I say, "That\'s wonderful!\nAnd what, what are you trying to tell me? That you  "\n"Well, I have an interest."\nI say, "Do you have passion?"\n"I have an interest," you say.\nYour interest is compared to what?\n"Well, I\'m interested in this."\nAnd what about the rest of humanity\'s activities?\n"I\'m not interested in them."\nYou\'ve looked at them all, have you?\n"No. Not exactly."'
p3171
aS'\nPassion is your greatest love.\nPassion is the thing that will help you create\nthe highest expression of your talent.\nPassion, interest -- it\'s not the same thing.\nAre you really going to go to your sweetie and say,\n"Marry me! You\'re interesting." (Laughter)\nWon\'t happen. Won\'t happen, and you will die alone. (Laughter)'
p3172
aS"\nWhat you want, what you want, what you want,\nis passion. It is beyond interest.\nYou need 20 interests, and then one of them,\none of them might grab you, one of them might engage you\nmore than anything else, and then you may have found\nyour greatest love in comparison to all the other things\nthat interest you, and that's what passion is."
p3173
aS'\nI have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.\nHe was an economically rational person.\nHe said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.\nLet us merge our interests."'
p3174
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3175
aS'\nYes he did.\n"I love you truly," he said. "I love you deeply. I love you\nmore than any other woman I\'ve ever encountered.\nI love you more than Mary, Jane, Susie, Penelope,\nIngrid, Gertrude, Gretel --\nI was on a German exchange program then." (Laughter)\n"I love you more than  "\nAll right! She left the room halfway through his enumeration\nof his love for her.\nAfter he got over his surprise at being, you know,\nturned down, he concluded he\'d had a narrow escape\nfrom marrying an irrational person,\nalthough he did make a note to himself that the next time\nhe proposed, it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate\nall of the women he had auditioned for the part. (Laughter)'
p3176
aS'\nBut the point stands. You must look for alternatives\nso that you find your destiny,\nor are you afraid of the word "destiny"?\nDoes the word "destiny" scare you?\nThat\'s what we\'re talking about, and if you don\'t find\nthe highest expression of your talent, if you settle\nfor "interesting," what the hell ever that means,\ndo you know what will happen at the end of your long life?\nYour friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery,\nand there, beside your gravesite will be a tombstone,\nand inscribed on that tombstone, it will say,\n"Here lies a distinguished engineer who invented Velcro."\nBut what that tombstone should have said,\nin an alternative lifetime,\nwhat it should have said if it was your highest expression of\ntalent, was, "Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics,\nwho formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory\nand demonstrated the practicality of warp drive."'
p3177
aS'\n(Laughter)\nVelcro, indeed. (Laughter)'
p3178
aS"\nOne was a great career.\nOne was a missed opportunity.\nBut then, there are some of you,\nin spite of all these excuses, you will find,\nyou will find your passion,\nand you'll still fail."
p3179
aS'\nYou\'re going to fail, because,\nbecause you\'re not going to do it,\nbecause you will have invented a new excuse,\nany excuse to fail to take action, and this excuse\nI\'ve heard so many times.\n"Yes, I would pursue a great career, but I value\nhuman relationships more than accomplishment.\nI want to be a great friend. I want to be a great spouse.\nI want to be a great parent, and I will not sacrifice them\non the altar of great accomplishment."'
p3180
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3181
aS'\nWhat do you want me to say?\nNow, do you really want me to say now, tell you,\n"Really, I swear I don\'t kick children." (Laughter)\nHmm? Look at the worldview you\'ve given yourself.\nYou\'re a hero no matter what, and I, by suggesting,\never so delicately, that you might want a great career,\nmust hate children. I don\'t hate children. I don\'t kick them.\nYes, there was a little kid wandering through this building\nwhen I came here, and no, I didn\'t kick him. (Laughter)'
p3182
aS"\nCourse, I had to tell him that the building was for adults only\nand to get out.\nHe mumbled something about his mother,\nand I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway.\nLast time I saw him, he was on the stairs crying. (Laughter)\nWhat a wimp. (Laughter)"
p3183
aS'\nBut what do you mean? That\'s what you expect me to say.\nYou really think, you really think it\'s appropriate\nthat you should actually take\nchildren and use them as a shield?\nYou know what will happen someday,\nyou, you ideal parent, you?\nThe kid will come to you someday and say,\n"I know what I want to be.\nI know what I\'m going to do with my life."\nYou are so happy. It\'s the conversation\na parent wants to hear, because your kid\'s good in math,\nand you know you\'re going to like what comes next.\nSays your kid, "I have decided\nI want to be a magician.\nI want to perform magic tricks on the stage."\n(Laughter)'
p3184
aS'\nAnd what do you say?\nYou say, you say,\n"Umm ... that\'s risky, kid.\nMight fail, kid. Don\'t make a lot of money at that, kid.\nYou know, I don\'t know, kid,\nyou should think about that again, kid,\nyou\'re so good at math, why don\'t you  "'
p3185
aS'\nAnd the kid interrupts you, and says,\n"But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this."\nAnd what are you going to say?\nYou know what you\'re going to say?\n"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but -- but."\nSo how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?\n"... But. I had a dream too, once, kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."\nOr, are you going to tell him this?\n"I had a dream once, kid.\nBut then you were born." (Laughter)'
p3186
aS'\n(Laughter) (Applause)'
p3187
aS'\nDo you, do you really want to use your family,\ndo you really ever want to look at your spouse\nand your kid and see your jailers?\nThere was something you could have said to your kid\nwhen he or she said, "I have a dream."\nYou could have said, looked the kid in the face, and said,\n"Go for it, kid,\njust like I did."\nBut you won\'t be able to say that\nbecause you didn\'t. So you can\'t. (Laughter)'
p3188
aS"\nAnd so the sins of the parents\nare visited on the poor children.\nWhy will you seek refuge in human relationships\nas your excuse not to find and pursue your passion?\nYou know why.\nIn your heart of hearts, you know why,\nand I'm being deadly serious.\nYou know why you would get all warm and fuzzy\nand wrap yourself up in human relationships.\nIt is because you are \nYou know what you are."
p3189
aS"\nYou're afraid to pursue your passion.\nYou're afraid to look ridiculous.\nYou're afraid to try. You're afraid you may fail.\nGreat friend, great spouse, great parent, great career.\nIs that not a package? Is that not who you are?\nHow can you be one without the other?\nBut you're afraid."
p3190
aS'\nAnd that\'s why you\'re not going to have a great career, unless --\nunless, that most evocative of all English words --\nunless.\nBut the unless word is also attached\nto that other, most terrifying phrase,\n"If only I had ... "\n"If only I had ... "\nIf you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain,\nit will hurt a lot.'
p3191
aS'\nSo, those are the many reasons\nwhy you are going to fail\nto have a great career,\nunless ...'
p3192
aS'\nUnless.'
p3193
aS'\nThank you. (Applause)'
p3194
aa(lp3195
S"\nI think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about\nwhat exactly autism is.\nAutism is a very big continuum\nthat goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal --\nall the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.\nAnd I actually feel at home here,\nbecause there's a lot of autism genetics here.\nYou wouldn't have any...\n(Applause)"
p3196
aS"\nIt's a continuum of traits.\nWhen does a nerd turn into\nAsperger, which is just mild autism?\nI mean, Einstein and Mozart\nand Tesla would all be probably diagnosed\nas autistic spectrum today.\nAnd one of the things that is really going to concern me is\ngetting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent\nthe next energy things,\nyou know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning."
p3197
aS"\nOK. Now, if you want to understand\nautism, animals.\nAnd I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.\nYou have to get away from verbal language.\nI think in pictures,\nI don't think in language.\nNow, the thing about the autistic mind\nis it attends to details.\nOK, this is a test where you either have to\npick out the big letters, or pick out the little letters,\nand the autistic mind picks out the\nlittle letters more quickly."
p3198
aS"\nAnd the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.\nWell, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important\nbecause it will fall down if you ignore the details.\nAnd one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today\nis things are getting too abstract.\nPeople are getting away from doing\nhands-on stuff.\nI'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out\nthe hands-on classes,\nbecause art, and classes like that,\nthose are the classes where I excelled."
p3199
aS"\nIn my work with cattle,\nI noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice\nwould make the cattle balk. Like, for example,\nthis flag waving, right in front of the veterinary facility.\nThis feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility;\nall they needed to do was move the flag.\nRapid movement, contrast.\nIn the early '70s when I started, I got right down\nin the chutes to see what cattle were seeing.\nPeople thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk,\nshadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor ...\npeople weren't noticing these things --\na chain hanging down --\nand that's shown very, very nicely in the movie."
p3200
aS'\nIn fact, I loved the movie, how they\nduplicated all my projects. That\'s the geek side.\nMy drawings got to star in the movie too.\nAnd actually it\'s called "Temple Grandin,"\nnot "Thinking In Pictures."'
p3201
aS'\nSo, what is thinking in pictures? It\'s literally movies\nin your head.\nMy mind works like Google for images.\nNow, when I was a young kid I didn\'t know my thinking was different.\nI thought everybody thought in pictures.\nAnd then when I did my book, "Thinking In Pictures,"\nI start interviewing people about how they think.\nAnd I was shocked to find out that\nmy thinking was quite different. Like if I say,\n"Think about a church steeple"\nmost people get this sort of generalized generic one.\nNow, maybe that\'s not true in this room,\nbut it\'s going to be true in a lot of different places.\nI see only specific pictures.\nThey flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.\nAnd in the movie, they\'ve got a great scene in there\nwhere the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of \'50s and \'60s shoes\npop into my imagination.'
p3202
aS'\nOK, there is my childhood church,\nthat\'s specific. There\'s some more, Fort Collins.\nOK, how about famous ones?\nAnd they just kind of come up, kind of like this.\nJust really quickly, like Google for pictures.\nAnd they come up one at a time,\nand then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow,\nor we can have a thunderstorm,"\nand I can hold it there and turn them into videos.'
p3203
aS"\nNow, visual thinking was a tremendous asset\nin my work designing cattle-handling facilities.\nAnd I've worked really hard on improving\nhow cattle are treated at the slaughter plant.\nI'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.\nI've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it.\nBut, one of the things that I was able to do in my design work\nis I could actually test run\na piece of equipment in my mind,\njust like a virtual reality computer system.\nAnd this is an aerial view\nof a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie.\nThat was like just so super cool.\nAnd there were a lot of kind of Asperger types\nand autism types working out there on the movie set too.\n(Laughter)\nBut one of the things that really worries me\nis: Where's the younger version of those kids going today?\nThey're not ending up in Silicon Valley, where they belong.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)"
p3204
aS"\nNow, one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social,\nis I had to sell my work, and not myself.\nAnd the way I sold livestock jobs\nis I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things.\nAnother thing that helped me as a little kid\nis, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.\nYou were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves\nin the store and throw it around."
p3205
aS"\nNow, when kids get to be in third or fourth grade,\nyou might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker,\ndrawing in perspective. Now, I want to\nemphasize that not every autistic kid\nis going to be a visual thinker.\nNow, I had this brain scan done several years ago,\nand I used to joke around about having a\ngigantic Internet trunk line\ngoing deep into my visual cortex.\nThis is tensor imaging.\nAnd my great big internet trunk line\nis twice as big as the control's.\nThe red lines there are me,\nand the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.\nAnd there I got a gigantic one,\nand the control over there, the blue one,\nhas got a really small one."
p3206
aS"\nAnd some of the research now is showing\nis that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex.\nNow, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind.\nYou see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind --\ngood at one thing, bad at something else.\nAnd where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed\nto take geometry or trig.\nGigantic mistake: I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra,\ngo right to geometry and trig."
p3207
aS"\nNow, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.\nMore abstract. These are your engineers,\nyour computer programmers.\nNow, this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis\nis made from a single sheet of paper --\nno scotch tape, no cuts.\nAnd there in the background is the pattern for folding it.\nHere are the types of thinking:\nphoto-realistic visual thinkers, like me;\npattern thinkers, music and math minds.\nSome of these oftentimes have problems with reading.\nYou also will see these kind of problems\nwith kids that are dyslexic.\nYou'll see these different kinds of minds.\nAnd then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything."
p3208
aS"\nNow, another thing is the sensory issues.\nI was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.\nAnd I came in half an hour beforehand\nso I could have it put on and kind of get used to it,\nand they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.\nBut sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights;\nothers have problems with sound sensitivity.\nYou know, it's going to be variable."
p3209
aS"\nNow, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight\ninto the animal mind.\nBecause think about it: An animal is a sensory-based thinker,\nnot verbal -- thinks in pictures,\nthinks in sounds, thinks in smells.\nThink about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant.\nHe knows who's been there, when they were there.\nAre they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?\nThere's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.\nIt's all very detailed information,\nand, looking at these kind of details\ngave me a lot of insight into animals."
p3210
aS"\nNow, the animal mind, and also my mind,\nputs sensory-based information\ninto categories.\nMan on a horse\nand a man on the ground --\nthat is viewed as two totally different things.\nYou could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.\nThey'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian\nand with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.\nYou have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up\nand he'll be terrible for anything on the ground,\nwith the veterinarian, but a person can ride him.\nCattle are the same way.\nMan on a horse,\na man on foot -- they're two different things.\nYou see, it's a different picture.\nSee, I want you to think about just how specific this is."
p3211
aS'\nNow, this ability to put information into categories,\nI find a lot of people are not very good at this.\nWhen I\'m out troubleshooting equipment\nor problems with something in a plant,\nthey don\'t seem to be able to figure out, "Do I have a training people issue?\nOr do I have something wrong with the equipment?"\nIn other words, categorize equipment problem\nfrom a people problem.\nI find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.\nNow, let\'s say I figure out it\'s an equipment problem.\nIs it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?\nOr is the whole design of the system wrong?\nPeople have a hard time figuring that out.'
p3212
aS"\nLet's just look at something like, you know,\nsolving problems with making airlines safer.\nYeah, I'm a million-mile flier.\nI do lots and lots of flying,\nand if I was at the FAA,\nwhat would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?\nIt would be their airplane tails.\nYou know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years,\nthe tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke\nin some way.\nIt's tails, pure and simple.\nAnd when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? They can't see\nthat stuff inside the tail.\nYou know, now as I think about that,\nI'm pulling up all of that specific information.\nIt's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up.\nI take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle."

aS"\nNow, here is a horse that was deathly afraid\nof black cowboy hats.\nHe'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.\nWhite cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.\nNow, the thing is, the world is going to need\nall of the different kinds of minds\nto work together.\nWe've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.\nAnd one of the things that is driving me really crazy,\nas I travel around and I do autism meetings,\nis I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids,\nand they just aren't very social,\nand nobody's working on developing their interest\nin something like science."
p3214
aS"\nAnd this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.\nMy science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.\nI was a goofball student. When I was in high school\nI just didn't care at all about studying,\nuntil I had Mr. Carlock's science class.\nHe was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.\nAnd he got me challenged\nto figure out an optical illusion room.\nThis brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids\ninteresting stuff.\nYou know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do\nis tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED,\nand there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet\nto get these kids turned on.\nBecause I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids,\nand the teachers out in the Midwest, and the other parts of the country,\nwhen you get away from these tech areas,\nthey don't know what to do with these kids.\nAnd they're not going down the right path."
p3215
aS"\nThe thing is, you can make a mind\nto be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,\nor your mind can be wired to be more social.\nAnd what some of the research now has shown in autism\nis there may by extra wiring back here,\nin the really brilliant mind, and we lose a few social circuits here.\nIt's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.\nAnd then you can get into the point where it's so severe\nyou're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.\nIn the normal human mind\nlanguage covers up the visual thinking we share with animals."
p3216
aS"\nThis is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.\nAnd he studied Alzheimer's patients\nthat had frontal temporal lobe dementia.\nAnd the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain,\nand then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars.\nNow, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics,\nbut I think it's very interesting\nthat there was some work done to show that\nthis eddy pattern in this painting\nfollowed a statistical model of turbulence,\nwhich brings up the whole interesting idea\nof maybe some of this mathematical patterns\nis in our own head."
p3217
aS"\nAnd the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking\nnotes and I was writing down all the\nsearch words I could use,\nbecause I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.\nWe've got to show these kids interesting stuff.\nAnd they've taken out the autoshop class\nand the drafting class and the art class.\nI mean art was my best subject in school."
p3218
aS"\nWe've got to think about all these different kinds of minds,\nand we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds,\nbecause we absolutely are going to need\nthese kind of people in the future.\nAnd let's talk about jobs.\nOK, my science teacher got me studying\nbecause I was a goofball that didn't want to study.\nBut you know what? I was getting work experience.\nI'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things,\nlike how to be on time.\nI was taught that when I was eight years old.\nYou know, how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.\nI was taught that when I was very, very young.\nAnd when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop\nsewing clothes.\nI did internships in college,\nI was building things,\nand I also had to learn how to do assignments."
p3219
aS'\nYou know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.\nMy mother said, "Well let\'s do a picture of something else."\nThey\'ve got to learn how to do something else.\nLet\'s say the kid is fixated on Legos.\nLet\'s get him working on building different things.\nThe thing about the autistic mind\nis it tends to be fixated.\nLike if a kid loves racecars,\nlet\'s use racecars for math.\nLet\'s figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance.\nIn other words, use that fixation\nin order to motivate that kid, that\'s one of the things we need to do.\nI really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers,\nespecially when you get away from this part of the country,\nthey don\'t know what to do with these smart kids.\nIt just drives me crazy.'
p3220
aS"\nWhat can visual thinkers do when they grow up?\nThey can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,\nphotography, industrial design.\nThe pattern thinkers, they're the ones that are going to be\nyour mathematicians, your software engineers,\nyour computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs.\nAnd then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists,\nand they also make really, really good stage actors.\nBecause the thing about being autistic is,\nI had to learn social skills like being in a play.\nIt's just kind of -- you just have to learn it."
p3221
aS"\nAnd we need to be working with these students.\nAnd this brings up mentors.\nYou know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.\nHe was a NASA space scientist.\nNow, some states now are getting it to where\nif you have a degree in biology, or a degree in chemistry,\nyou can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.\nWe need to be doing that.\nBecause what I'm observing is\nthe good teachers, for a lot of these kids,\nare out in the community colleges,\nbut we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools."
p3222
aS"\nAnother thing that can be very, very, very successful is\nthere is a lot of people that may have retired\nfrom working in the software industry, and they can teach your kid.\nAnd it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old,\nbecause what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.\nYou're getting that kid turned on.\nAnd you get him turned on, then he'll learn all the new stuff.\nMentors are just essential.\nI cannot emphasize enough\nwhat my science teacher did for me.\nAnd we've got to mentor them, hire them."
p3223
aS'\nAnd if you bring them in for internships in your companies,\nthe thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind,\nyou\'ve got to give them a specific task. Don\'t just say, "Design new software."\nYou\'ve got to tell them something a lot more specific:\n"Well, we\'re designing a software for a phone\nand it has to do some specific thing.\nAnd it can only use so much memory."\nThat\'s the kind of specificity you need.'

p3230
aS"\nTG: Well, first of all, you've got to look at age.\nIf you have a two, three or four year old\nyou know, no speech, no social interaction,\nI can't emphasize enough:\nDon't wait, you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.\nYou know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees.\nThere's going to be about half the people on the spectrum\nthat are not going to learn to talk, and they're not going to be working\nSilicon Valley, that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do."
p3231
aS"\nBut then you get the smart, geeky kids\nthat have a touch of autism,\nand that's where you've got to get them turned on\nwith doing interesting things.\nI got social interaction through shared interest.\nI rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,\ndid electronics lab with other kids,\nand in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors\nonto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show.\nThat was like, we considered that super cool."
p3232
aS'\nCA: Is it unrealistic for them\nto hope or think that that child\nloves them, as some might, as most, wish?'

p3235
aS'\nTG: I\'m passionate about that the things I do\nare going to make the world a better place.\nWhen I have a mother of an autistic child say,\n"My kid went to college because of your book,\nor one of your lectures," that makes me happy.'
p3236
aS"\nYou know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them\nin the '80s; they were absolutely awful.\nI developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants\nwhere you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down?\nHow many cattle got poked with the prodder?\nHow many cattle are mooing their heads off?\nAnd it's very, very simple.\nYou directly observe a few simple things.\nIt's worked really well.

aa(lp3242
S"\nI'm not quite sure whether I really want to see\na snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.\nBut anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater,\nand really I must thank Herbie Hancock\nand his colleagues for such a great presentation. (Applause)\nOne of the interesting things,\nof course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument\nand technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people."
p3243
aS"\nOf course, my job is all about listening,\nand my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.\nThat's my only real aim in life.\nAnd it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.\nBecause you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example,\nif I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully,\na piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.\nAnd, you know, we open it up and I read the music.\nSo technically, I can actually read this.\nI will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.\nI will do exactly as I'm told.\nAnd so therefore, because time is short,\nif I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward.\nThere's nothing too difficult about the piece.\nBut here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.\nI'm being told where to play on the drum.\nI'm being told which part of the stick to use.\nAnd I'm being told the dynamic.\nAnd I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.\nSnares on, snares off.\nSo therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea. (Music)\nAnd so on. My career would probably last about five years."
p3244
aS"\nHowever, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.\nEverything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher,\nor to talk about, even, from a teacher.\nBut it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument\nthat in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explore\nthrough this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.\nSo there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation. (Music) (Applause)\nNow my career may last a little longer!"
p3245
aS"\nBut in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see\na nice bright young lady with a pink top on.\nI see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.\nSo I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like,\nwhat you might do as a profession, etc., etc.\nHowever, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get\nwhen we actually look, and we try to interpret,\nbut actually it's so unbelievably shallow.\nIn the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea;\nI wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.\nJust the basic feeling."
p3246
aS"\nHowever, that is simply not enough.\nAnd I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen.\nWe have to listen to ourselves, first of all.\nIf I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick --\nyou'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.\nAnd you feel really quite -- believe it or not --\ndetached from the instrument and from the stick,\neven though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.\nBy holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.\nIf I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system,\nsuddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more.\nAnd I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum.\nAnd I'm doing far, far less."
p3247
aS'\nSo in the same way that I need time with this instrument,\nI need time with people in order to interpret them.\nNot just translate them, but interpret them.\nIf, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music\nfor which I think of myself as a technician --\nthat is, someone who is basically a percussion player ... (Music)\nAnd so on. If I think of myself as a musician ... (Music)\nAnd so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause)\n-- thinking about.'
p3248
aS'\nAnd I remember when I was 12 years old,\nand I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said,\n"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."\nAnd I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what\'s the problem?"\nAnd he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"\nAnd I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"\nHe said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."\nAnd I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands,\nthrough my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."'
p3249
aS"\nAnd so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums --\nin particular, the kettle drums, or tympani --\nto such a narrow pitch interval, so something like ...\nthat of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ...\nand it's amazing that when you do open your body up,\nand open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,\nthat in fact the tiny, tiny difference ...\ncan be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there."
p3250
aS'\nAnd so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall\nof the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments,\nand really try to connect with those sounds\nfar, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.\nBecause of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.\nThe room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument,\nthe type of sticks ... etc., etc.\nThey\'re all different.\nSame amount of weight, but different sound colors.\nAnd that\'s basically what we are. We\'re just human beings,\nbut we all have our own little sound colors, as it were,\nthat make up these extraordinary personalities\nand characters and interests and things.'
p3251
aS'\nAnd as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London,\nand they said, "Well, no, we won\'t accept you, because we haven\'t a clue,\nyou know, of the future of a so-called \'deaf\' musician."\nAnd I just couldn\'t quite accept that.\nAnd so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse --\nif you refuse me through those reasons,\nas opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love\nthe art of creating sound --\nthen we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."\nAnd as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice --\nthey accepted me. And not only that --\nwhat had happened was that it changed the whole role\nof the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.'
p3252
aS'\nUnder no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of\nwhether someone had no arms, no legs --\nthey could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.\nNo circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.\nAnd every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then\nbased on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.\nSo therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting\nbunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions.\nAnd I have to say, many of them now\nin the professional orchestras throughout the world.\nThe interesting thing about this as well, though --\n(Applause) --\nis quite simply that not only were people connected with sound --\nwhich is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.'
p3253
aS'\nI say "music," but actually I mean "sound."\nBecause you know, some of the extraordinary things I\'ve experienced\nas a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad\nwho has got the most incredible challenges,\nwho may not be able to control his movements,\nwho may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. --\nsuddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,\nand perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,\nand you play something that\'s so incredibly organ-like, almost --\nI don\'t really have the right sticks, perhaps --\nbut something like this. Let me change. (Music)\nSomething that\'s so unbelievably simple --\nbut he would be experiencing something that I wouldn\'t be,\nbecause I\'m on top of the sound.\nI have the sound coming this way.\nHe would have the sound coming through the resonators.\nIf there were no resonators on here, we would have ... (Music)\nSo he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows\nwouldn\'t experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn\'t experience either.\nEvery single one of us, depending on where we\'re sitting,\nwill experience this sound quite, quite differently.\nAnd of course, being the participator of the sound,\nand that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce --\nfor example, this sound.'
p3254
aS"\nCan you hear anything?\nExactly. Because I'm not even touching it.\nBut yet, we get the sensation of something happening.\nIn the same way that when I see tree moves,\nthen I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.\nDo you see what I mean?\nWhatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.\nSo there's always, always that huge --\nI mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from."
p3255
aS"\nSo all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience,\nand not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it,\nbuying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth.\nBecause that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic,\nand something that I can fully experience the journey of.\nSo it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. (Music)\nIt may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that\nat all and so therefore, my level of soft,\ngentle playing may have to be ... (Music)\nDo you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound,\nespecially through the deaf community,\nthis has not only affected how music institutions,\nhow schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy --\nalthough of course, being a participator of music,\nthat definitely is the case as well.\nBut it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls\nthey put together. There are so few halls in this world\nthat actually have very good acoustics,\ndare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.\nThe tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad,\nso huge, so incredible! There's always something --\nit may sound good up there, may not be so good there.\nMay be great there, but terrible up there.\nMaybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc."
p3256
aS'\nSo to find an actual hall is incredible\n-- for which you can play exactly what you imagine,\nwithout it being cosmetically enhanced.\nAnd so therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are\nhearing impaired, and who are participators of sound.\nAnd this is quite interesting.\nI cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening\nwith those halls, but it\'s just the fact that they are going to a group of people\nfor whom so many years we\'ve been saying,\n"Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they\'re deaf."\nWe just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that\'s what deafness is about.\nOr we go like that, and we imagine that\'s what blindness is about.\nIf we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.\nIt may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.\nIn a year\'s time, it could be two extra steps.\nIn another year\'s time, three extra steps.'
p3257
aS'\nThose are hugely important aspects to think about.\nSo when we do listen to each other,\nit\'s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills,\nto really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment.\nFor me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music,\nit\'s very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.\nOh no, I don\'t like that piece." And so on.\nAnd you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.\nIt may be that the chemistry isn\'t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music,\nbut that doesn\'t mean I have the right to say it\'s a bad piece of music.\nAnd you know, it\'s just one of the great things about being a musician,\nis that it is so unbelievably fluid.\nSo there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.'
p3258
aS'\nIf I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.\nIf I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."\nI\'m assuming we\'ve all experienced thunder.\nNow, I don\'t mean just the sound;\nI mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.\nAnd please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try.\n(Applause)'
p3259
aS'\nVery good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow?'
p3260
aS'\nAudience: No.'
p3261
aS'\nEvelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. (Laughter) Try again.\nTry again. Snow.'
p3262
aS"\nSee, you're awake."
p3263
aS'\nRain. Not bad. Not bad.'
p3264
aS'\nYou know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids\nnot so long ago exactly the same question.\nNow -- great imagination, thank you very much.\nHowever, not one of you got out of your seats to think,\n"Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ... (Claps)\nMaybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.\nMaybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."\nNot a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way\nother than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.\nIn the same way that when we listen to music,\nwe assume that it\'s all being fed through here.\nThis is how we experience music. Of course it\'s not.'
p3265
aS'\nWe experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think.\nListen, listen, listen. Now -- what can we do with thunder?\nI remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson,\nI was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.\nAnd instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,\narms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape,\nkeep this amount of space here, etc.\nPlease keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." --\nwhere I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen,\nand I would not be able to strike the drum,\nbecause I was thinking of so many other things -- he said,\n"Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I\'ll see you next week."'
p3266
aS"\nSo, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks;\nI wasn't allowed to have these sticks.\nI had to basically look at this particular drum,\nsee how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.\nTurned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.\nExperimented with my body, experimented with jewelry,\nexperimented with all sorts of things.\nAnd of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that --\nbut nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience,\nbecause then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?\nWhere on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book?\nSo we never, ever dealt with actual study books.\nSo for example, one of the things that we learn\nwhen we are dealing with being a percussion player, as opposed to a musician,\nis basically straightforward single stroke rolls."
p3267
aS'\nLike that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.\nAnd so on and so forth. What does this piece require?\nSingle stroke rolls. So why can\'t I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?\nAnd that\'s exactly what he did.\nAnd interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student\nat a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.\nWe had to study from study books.\nAnd constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?\nI need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!"\n"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music.\nYou know. I need to say something.'
p3268
aS'\n"Why am I practicing paradiddles?\nIs it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?\nI need to have the reason,\nand the reason has to be by saying something through the music."\nAnd by saying something through music, which basically is sound,\nwe then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.\nBut I don\'t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.\nThat\'s up to you, when you walk through a hall.\nBecause that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.\nI may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play\ncertain pieces of music, but I\'m not necessarily\nwanting you to feel exactly the same thing.\nSo please, the next time you go to a concert,\njust allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber.\nBe aware that you\'re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.'
p3269
aS"\nThe performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound,\nbecause they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum,\nor the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc.,\nor the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.\nThey're experiencing that rawness there.\nBut yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure,\nwhich is before the sound is actually happening.\nPlease take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike,\nor breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound\nin the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey\nof this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.\nBut I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.\nBut thank you very much for having me!\n(Applause)"

S'\nOn September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,\nI came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes\nand my father was reading the paper or something,\nand I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,\n"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I\'m seven."\nAnd my father smiled and said,\n"Well, you know what that means, don\'t you?"\nAnd I said, "Yeah, that I\'m going to have a party and a cake\nand get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.\nBut, more importantly, being seven means that you\'ve reached the age of reason,\nand you\'re now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."\n(Laughter)'
p3272
aS'\nNow, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.\nSister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about\nmy second-grade class at school. But when she said it,\nthe phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations\nfor our first communion and our first confession,\nand everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil,\nand anyway, I hadn\'t really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."\nSo, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"\nAnd my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church\nthat God knows that little kids don\'t know the difference between right and wrong,\nbut when you\'re seven, you\'re old enough to know better.\nSo, you\'ve grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now\nGod will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."\n(Laughter)\nAnd I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time,\nup till today, all that time I was so good, God didn\'t notice it?"\nAnd my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."\n(Laughter)\nAnd I thought, "How could I not have known this before?\nHow could it not have sunk in when they\'d been telling me?\nAll that being good and no real credit for it.\nAnd, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information\nuntil the very day that it was basically useless to me?"\nSo I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?\nI mean, Santa Claus knows if you\'re naughty or nice, right?"\nAnd my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,\nI think that\'s technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."\nAnd my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let\'s just tell her.\nI mean, she\'s seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."\n(Laughter)\nNow, this was actually not that upsetting to me.'
p3273
aS"\nMy parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:\nhow they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed\nthat instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve,\nlike he did for every other family\nwho got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning,\nour family would give Santa more time.\nSanta would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass\non Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.\nWhich made me very suspicious.\nIt was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.\nI mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,\nand my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.\nPlus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back\nto our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?\nThere's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:\nour family was too strange and weird\nfor even Santa Claus to come visit,\nand my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,\nthis humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly --\nbut, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.\nSo, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief."
p3274
aS'\nI left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,\nbut rather I was just dumbfounded\nabout how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.\nIt was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,\nsomeone who could use the information.\nThey had to fit two criteria:\nthey had to be old enough to be able to understand\nthe whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.\nThe answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.\nWell, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house\nat this public school playground. It was a Saturday,\nand he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.\nI ran up to him and said, "Bill!\nI just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,\nand then you\'re capable of committing any and all sins\nagainst God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said,\n"So, you\'re six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to\nand God won\'t notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said,\n"So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.\nBut when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically\nand said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."\n(Laughter)'
p3275
aS'\nNow, I didn\'t know it at the time,\nbut I really wasn\'t turning seven on September 10.\nFor my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,\nbut a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,\n"I need to speak to you privately.\nSeptember 10 is not your birthday. It\'s October 10." And I said, "What?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."\n(Laughter)\n"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10,\nand then I wasn\'t sure that you weren\'t just going to go blab it all over the place,\nso I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.\nBut, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."\nI thought about it, and when I was four,\nI was already the oldest of four children,\nand my mother even had another child to come,\nso what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready,\nshe was so ready. Then she said,\n"Don\'t worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday\nbut you didn\'t realize it, I made sure\nthat you ate a piece of cake that day."\n(Laughter)\nWhich was comforting, but troubling.\nMy mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.\nWhat was so upsetting about this new piece of information\nwas not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party\nwith all of my girlfriends,\nwhat was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.\nI had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom,\nand I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.\n(Laughter)\nAnd this meant that I was a Libra?\nSo, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.\nThe Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,\nsort of lounging by some water,\nbut the Libra poster is just a huge scale.\nThis was around the time that I started filling out physically,\nand I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,\nand, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale\njust seemed ominous and depressing.\n(Laughter)\nBut I got the new Libra poster,\nand I started to read my new Libra horoscope,\nand I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.'
p3276
aS'\nIt wasn\'t until years later, looking back\non this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing,\nthat it dawned on me: I wasn\'t turning seven\nwhen I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month\nto do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.\nOh, life can be so cruel.\nOne day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.\nNow, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,\nand my block is -- well, it\'s a natural beginning\nfor people who are peddling things door to door.\nSometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church\nshowing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.\nAnd sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won\'t join a gang\nand just start robbing people if I only buy\nsome magazine subscriptions from them.\nSo, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.\nAnd there stood two boys, each about 19,\nin white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags\nthat identified them as official representatives\nof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\nand they said they had a message for me from God.\nI said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."\nNow, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,\naround a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,\nI\'ve worked with them and even dated them,\nbut I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people\nwhen they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious,\nso I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy,\nbecause I don\'t think this happens to them all that often.\n(Laughter)'
p3277
aS'\nAnd I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water --\nOK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.\nDon\'t touch my hair, that\'s the thing.\n(Laughter)\nYou can\'t put a video of myself in front of me\nand expect me not to fix my hair.\n(Laughter)\nOK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,\nand after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"\nAnd I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,\nbut, you know, I don\'t like that word, heart,\nbecause it anthropomorphizes God,\nand I don\'t like the word, \'his,\' either, because that sexualizes God."\nBut I didn\'t want to argue semantics with these boys,\nso after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said\n"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."\nAnd they looked at each other and smiled,\nlike that was the right answer. And then they said,\n"Do you believe that we\'re all brothers and sisters on this planet?"\nAnd I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved\nthat it was a question I could answer so quickly.\nAnd they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."'
p3278
aS'\nAnd they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,\nwho lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.\nNow, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,\neveryone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them:\nman, woman, child, infant, fetus.\nAnd God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat\nand I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.\nHe led them to America.\nI said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"\nAnd they said, "Yes."\n(Laughter)\nThen they told me how Lehi and his descendants\nreproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years\nthere were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,\nand the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them --\nand the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --\nevery single one of them just bad to the bone.\n(Laughter)'
p3279
aS'\nThen, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,\non his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.\n(Laughter)\nAnd he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good --\neach and every one of them --\nthey would win the war against the evil Lamanites.\nBut apparently somebody blew it,\nbecause the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.\nAll but one guy, this guy named Mormon,\nwho managed to survive by hiding in the woods.\nAnd he made sure this whole story was written down\nin reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,\nwhich he then buried near Palmyra, New York.\n(Laughter)\nWell, I was just on the edge of my seat.\n(Laughter)\nI said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"\nAnd they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."\nAnd I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended\nfrom a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."\nThen they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith\nfound those buried gold plates right in his backyard,\nand he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat\nand then buried his face into, and this allowed him\nto translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.'
p3280
aS'\nWell, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys\nsome advice about their pitch.\n(Laughter)\nI wanted to say, "OK, don\'t start with this story."\nI mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --\n(Applause)\n-- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.\nWell, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us\nthrough his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don\'t."\nBecause I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story\nand this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was,\nI hadn\'t really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said,\n"Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?\nAnd what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"\nAnd they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said,\n"Well, it\'s because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular,\nit is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men\nwas the gift of prophecy."\nWhat is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?\nMaybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?\nWomen\'s longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be\nmuch less violent than men? But, no, it wasn\'t any of these gifts.\nThey said, "Well, it\'s her ability to bear children."\nI said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby\nevery single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,\nassuming they didn\'t die from exhaustion,\nit still seems like some women would have some time left over\nto hear the word of God." And they said, "No."\n(Laughter)'
p3281
aS'\nWell, then they didn\'t look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,\nbut they had more to say.\nThey said, "Well, we also believe that if you\'re a Mormon\nand if you\'re in good standing with the church, when you die\nyou get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."\nAnd I said, "Oh, dear --\n(Laughter)\n-- that wouldn\'t be such a good incentive for me."\n(Laughter)\nAnd they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe\nthat when you go to heaven you get your body restored\nto you in its best original state.\nLike, if you\'d lost a leg, well, you get it back.\nOr, if you\'d gone blind, you could see."\nI said, "Oh -- now, I don\'t have a uterus because I had cancer\na few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven\nI would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."\nAnd I said, "I don\'t want it back. I\'m happy without it." Gosh.\nWhat if you had a nose job and you liked it?\n(Laughter)\nWould God force you to get your old nose back?\nWell, then they gave me this Book of Mormon,\nand they told me to read this chapter and that chapter,\nand they said they\'d come back some day and check in on me,\nand I think I said something like, "Please don\'t hurry,"\nor maybe it was just, "Please don\'t," and they were gone.'
p3282
aS'\nOK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys,\nand smug in my more conventional faith. But then,\nthe more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.\nIf someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology\nand dogma for the very first time, and they said,\n"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl\nwithout the use of intercourse,\nand the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us --\n(Laughter)\n-- and she had a baby, and that\'s the son of God,"\nI mean, I would think that\'s equally ridiculous.\nI\'m just so used to that story.\n(Laughter)\nSo, I couldn\'t let myself feel condescending towards these boys.'
p3283
aS'\nBut the question they asked me when they first arrived\nreally stuck in my head:\nDid I believe that God loved me with all his heart?\nBecause I wasn\'t exactly sure how I felt about that question.\nNow, if they\'d asked me,\nDo you feel that God loves you with all his heart?\nWell, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,\n"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God\'s love when I\'m hurt and confused,\nand I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God\'s love\nwhen I don\'t understand why tragedy hits,\nand I feel God\'s love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."\nBut since they asked me that question with the word believe in it,\nsomehow it was all different,\nbecause I wasn\'t exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.'
p3284
aa(lp3285
S'\nThe "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called\nto a little town in Colorado, called Craig.\nIt\'s only a couple dozen square miles. It\'s in the Rockies.\nAnd the job in question was sheep rancher.'
p3286
aS"\nMy role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.\nI'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question.\nAnd my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up\nand give an honest account of what it's like to be these people,\nfor one day in their life.\nThe job in question: herding sheep. Great."
p3287
aS'\nWe go to Craig and we check in to a hotel\nand I realize the next day that castration\nis going to be an absolute part of this work.\nSo, normally, I never do any research at all.\nBut, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,\nand we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do,\nand we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.\nSo I called the Humane Society\nand I say, "Look, I\'m going to be castrating some lambs,\nCan you tell me the deal?"'
p3288
aS'\nAnd they\'re like, "Yeah, it\'s pretty straightforward."\nThey use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.\nThis one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday,\nbut it had a certain familiarity to it.'
p3289
aS'\nAnd I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"'
p3290
aS'\nAnd they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.\nAnd then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.\nBlood flow is slowly retarded;\na week later the parts in question fall off.'
p3291
aS'\n"Great -- got it."\nOK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it.\nI also call PETA, just for fun, and they don\'t like it -- but they confirm it.\nOK, that\'s basically how you do it.'
p3292
aS"\nSo the next day I go out.\nAnd I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs\nand we take them to a pen that we built,\nand we go about the business of animal husbandry."
p3293
aS"\nMelanie is the wife of Albert.\nAlbert is the shepherd in question.\nMelanie picks up the lamb -- two hands --\none hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.\nLamb goes on the post, she opens it up.\nAlright. Great.\nAlbert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.\nI always watch the process done the first time before I try it.\nBeing an apprentice, you know, you do that.\nAlbert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band\nbut what comes out instead is a knife.\nAnd I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.\nAnd he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun\nthat was just coming over the Rockies, it was very --\nit was, it was impressive."
p3294
aS"\nIn the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife\nbetween the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb,\nand very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.\nA second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger,\nhe had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.\nAnd he pulled it toward him, like so,\nand he took the knife and he put it on the tip.\nNow you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?\nHe snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,\nand then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,\nand then his head dips down, obscuring my view,\nbut what I hear is a slurping sound,\nand a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall\nand I am not even kidding."
p3295
aS"\nCan we roll the video?\nNo I'm kidding -- we don't --\n(Laughter)\nI thought it best to talk in pictures."
p3296
aS'\nSo, I do something now I\'ve never ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.\nI say, "Time out. Stop."\nYou guys know the show, we use take one, we don\'t do take two.\nThere\'s no writing, there\'s no scripting, there\'s no nonsense.\nWe don\'t fool around, we don\'t rehearse --\nwe shoot what we get!'
p3297
aS'\nI said, "Stop. This is nuts."\nI mean, you know.\n(Laughter)\n"This is crazy.\nWe can\'t do this."'
p3298
aS'\nAnd Albert\'s like, "What?"'
p3299
aS'\nAnd I\'m like, "I don\'t know what just happened,\nbut there are testicles in this bucket and that\'s not how we do it."'
p3300
aS'\nAnd he said "Well, that\'s how we do it."'
p3301
aS'\nAnd I said, "Why would you do it this way?"\nAnd before I even let him explain,\nI said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."'
p3302
aS'\nAnd he says, "Like the Humane Society?"'
p3303
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.\nLet\'s do something that doesn\'t make the lamb squeal and bleed --\nwe\'re on in five continents, dude.\nWe\'re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can\'t do this."'
p3304
aS'\nHe says, "OK."\nHe goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.\nMelanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,\nband goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.\nLamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,\ngets up, shakes a little,\ntakes another couple steps, falls down.\nI\'m like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.\nGets up, walks to the corner, it\'s quivering,\nand it lies down and it\'s in obvious distress.'
p3305
aS'\nAnd I\'m looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?\nWhen does he get up?"'
p3306
aS'\nHe\'s like, "A day."'
p3307
aS'\nI said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"'
p3308
aS'\n"A week."'
p3309
aS"\nMeanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on\nis, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.\nHe's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.\nAnd I was just so blown away\nat how wrong I was, in that second.\nAnd I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day\nbecause now I had to do what Albert had just done,\nand there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen,\nand suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,\nand I'm like ... (Laughter)"
p3310
aS'\nMelanie picks up the lamb,\nputs it on the post, opens it up.\nAlbert hands me the knife.\nI go in, tail comes off.\nI go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.\nAlbert instructs, "Push it way up there."\nI do.\n"Push it further."\nI do.'
p3311
aS'\nThe testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you --\nand he says, "Bite \'em.\nJust bite \'em off."\nAnd I heard him, I heard all the words.\n(Laughter)\nLike, how did -- how did I get here?\nHow did -- you know -- I mean --\nhow did I get here?\n(Laughter)'
p3312
aS"\nIt's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own:\nand suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies,\nand all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.\nYou know, Aristotle says a tragedy\nis that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.\n(Laughter)"
p3313
aS'\nAnd I\'m like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?\nI don\'t like what I\'m thinking right now."\nAnd I can\'t get this thought out of my head,\nand I can\'t get that vision out of my sight,\nso I did what I had to do.\nI went in and I took them.\nI took them like this,\nand I yanked my face back.\nAnd I\'m standing there\nwith two testicles on my chin.\n(Laughter)\nAnd now I can\'t get -- I can\'t shake the metaphor.'
p3314
aS'\nOK, I\'m still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,\nand I\'m thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head\nthat I haven\'t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there.\nAnd they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.\nAnagnorisis and peripeteia.\nAnagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.\nLiterally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.\nIt\'s what our network does;\nit\'s what "Dirty Jobs" is.\nAnd I\'m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.\nGreat.\nThe other word, peripeteia,\nthat\'s the moment in the great tragedies, you know --\nEuripides and Sophocles --\nthe moment where Oedipus has his moment,\nwhere he suddenly realizes that hot chick\nhe\'s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK.\nThat\'s peripety\nor peripeteia.\nAnd this metaphor in my head --\nI got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.\n(Laughter)'
p3315
aS'\nI got to tell you, it\'s such a great device though.\nWhen you start to look for peripetia,\nyou find it everywhere.\nI mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?\nSpends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,\nand then, boom -- "Oh, I\'m dead" -- peripetia.\nYou know?\nIt\'s crushing when the audience sees it the right way.\nNeo in "The Matrix," you know?\n"Oh, I\'m living in a computer program" -- that\'s weird.'
p3316
aS"\nThese discoveries that lead to sudden realizations;\nand I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time,\nbut that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.\nAnd, as I stood there,\nlooking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled --\nbut it looked OK.\nLooking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,\nand I just was struck by\nif I'm wrong about that\nand if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,\nwhat other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?"
p3317
aS'\nBecause, look, I\'m not a social anthropologist\nbut I have a friend who is.\nAnd I talk to him.\n(Laughter)\nAnd he says, "Hey Mike.\nLook, I don\'t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,\nbut do you realize you\'ve shot in every state?\nYou\'ve worked in mining, you\'ve worked in fishing,\nyou\'ve worked in steel, you\'ve worked in every major industry.\nYou\'ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys\nthat our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"'
p3318
aS'\nI can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,\ndribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.\nI mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.\n"And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,\nit might be time to think about it.\nBecause, dude, you know, four years."\nYou know, that\'s in my head, testicles are on my chin,\nthoughts are bouncing around.\nAnd, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn\'t change,\nin terms of what the show is,\nbut it changed for me, personally.'
p3319
aS'\nAnd now, when I talk about the show,\nI no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.\nI do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong,\nsome of the other notions of work\nthat I\'ve just been assuming are sacrosanct,\nand they\'re not.\nPeople with dirty jobs are happier than you think.\nAs a group, they\'re the happiest people I know.\nAnd I don\'t want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"\nand all that happy worker crap.\nI\'m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.\nRoadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God --\nI did it with them.\nThey\'ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.\nAnd I see it over and over and over again.'
p3320
aS"\nSo I started to wonder what would happen\nif we challenged some of these sacred cows.\nFollow your passion --\nwe've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.\nFollow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?\nProbably the worst advice I ever got.\n(Laughter)\nYou know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?\nI mean, that's all I heard growing up.\nI didn't know what to do with my life,\nbut I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out."
p3321
aS'\nI can give you 30 examples, right now --\nBob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas\nwho collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos\nand feeds them them to his swine.\nWhy? Because there\'s so much protein in the stuff we don\'t eat\nhis pigs grow at twice the normal speed,\nand he is one rich pig farmer,\nand he is good for the environment,\nand he spends his days doing this incredible service,\nand he smells like hell, but God bless him.\nHe\'s making a great living.\nYou ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"\nand he\'d laugh at you.\nThe guy\'s worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm\nand turned it down, outside of Vegas.\nHe didn\'t follow his passion.\nHe stepped back and he watched where everybody was going\nand he went the other way.\nAnd I hear that story over and over.'
p3322
aS"\nMatt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,\nwho woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows\nwas worth more than their milk,\nif he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots.\nNow, he's selling them to Walmart.\nFollow his passion? The guy's -- come on."
p3323
aS'\nSo I started to look at passion,\nI started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness --\nas Tim talked about earlier, that\'s a huge distinction.\nI started to look at teamwork and determination,\nand basically all those platitudes they call "successories"\nthat hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now.\nThat stuff --\nit\'s suddenly all been turned on its head.'
p3324
aS"\nSafety -- safety first?\nGoing back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:\nwhat if OSHA got it wrong?\nI mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say --\nbut what if it's really safety third?\nRight?\n(Laughter)\nNo, I mean really.\nWhat I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs\nas much as the people that I'm working with,\nbut the ones who really get it done,\nthey're not out there talking about safety first.\nThey know that other things come first --\nthe business of doing the work comes first,\nthe business of getting it done."
p3325
aS'\nAnd I\'ll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat\nwith the "Deadliest Catch" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season.\nWe\'re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:\n50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?\nMost hazardous environment I\'d ever seen,\nand I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.\nSo, I\'m 40 feet off the deck,\nwhich is like looking down at the top of your shoe,\nyou know, and it\'s doing this in the ocean.\nUnspeakably dangerous.'
p3326
aS'\nI scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse\nand I say, with some level of incredulity,\n"Captain, OSHA."'
p3327
aS'\nAnd he says, "OSHA? Ocean."\nAnd he points out there.\n(Laughter)\nBut in that moment, what he said next can\'t be repeated in the lower 48.\nIt can\'t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.\nBut he looked at me, and he said, "Son" --\nhe\'s my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that --\nhe says, "Son, I\'m a captain of a crab boat.\nMy responsibility is not to get you home alive.\nMy responsibility is to get you home rich."\n(Laughter)\nYou want to get home alive, that\'s on you.\nAnd for the rest of that day, safety first.'
p3328
aS"\nI was like --\nSo, the idea that we create this false --\nthis sense of complacency\nwhen all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility\nas though it's our own, and vice versa.\nAnyhow, a whole lot of things.\nI could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made\nand the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.\nBut, what it all comes down to is this.\nI formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now\nin my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds."
p3329
aS'\nIt goes like this --\nwe\'ve declared war on work,\nas a society, all of us.\nIt\'s a civil war.\nIt\'s a cold war, really.\nWe didn\'t set out to do it\nand we didn\'t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,\nbut we\'ve done it.\nAnd we\'ve waged this war on at least four fronts,\ncertainly in Hollywood.\nThe way we portray working people on TV --\nit\'s laughable.\nIf there\'s a plumber, he\'s 300 pounds and he\'s got a giant butt crack. Admit it.\nYou see him all the time.\nThat\'s what plumbers look like, right?\nWe turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.\nThat\'s what TV does.\nWe try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,\nwhich is why I do the work and I don\'t cheat.'
p3330
aS"\nBut, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.\nI mean, so many of the commercials that come out there --\nin the way of a message, what's really being said?\nYour life would be better if you could work a little less,\nif you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier,\nif you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner --\nit's all in there, over and over, again and again."
p3331
aS"\nWashington? I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place\nthat affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs\nbecause I don't really know.\nI just know that that's a front in this war."
p3332
aS'\nAnd right here guys, Silicon Valley,\nI mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?\nHow many people have their Blackberries?\nWe\'re plugged in; we\'re connected.\nI would never suggest for a second\nthat something bad has come out of the tech revolution.\nGood grief, not to this crowd.\n(Laughter)\nBut I would suggest that innovation without imitation\nis a complete waste of time.\nAnd nobody celebrates imitation\nthe way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.\nYour iPhone without those people making the same interface,\nthe same circuitry, the same board, over and over?\nAll of that? That\'s what makes it equally as possible\nas the genius that goes inside of it.'
p3333
aS"\nSo, we've got this new toolbox, you know.\nOur tools today don't look like shovels and picks.\nThey look like the stuff we walk around with.\nAnd so the collective effect of all of that\nhas been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.\nAnd I realized, probably too late in this game --\nI hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things --\nbut we're going to do as many as we can.\nAnd to me the most important thing to know\nand to really come face to face with,\nis that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,\nnot just the testicles on my chin.\nI got a lot wrong."
p3334
aS"\nSo, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me --\nthat the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work,\nmanual labor, skilled labor.\nSomebody needs to be out there\ntalking about the forgotten benefits.\nI'm talking about grandfather stuff,\nthe stuff a lot us probably grew up with\nbut we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost\na little."
p3335
aS"\nBarack wants to create two and a half million jobs.\nThe infrastructure is a huge deal.\nThis war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties\nlike any other war.\nThe infrastructure's the first one;\ndeclining trade-school enrollments are the second one.\nEvery single year: fewer electricians,\nfewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,\nfewer welders, fewer pipefitters,\nfewer steamfitters.\nThe infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating\nare those guys --\nthe ones that have been in decline, over and over.\nMeanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum,\naccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers --\nthat we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,\nwhich is currently rated at a D minus."
p3336
aS"\nSo, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,\nI would simply say that the jobs we hope to make\nand the jobs we hope to create\naren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.\nAnd I know the point of this conference\nis to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,\nbut I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.\nThey're two sides of the same coin,\njust like innovation and imitation,\nlike risk and responsibility,\nlike peripetia and anagnorisis,\nlike that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,\nand like my time that's gone."
p3337
aS"\nIt's been great talking to you\nand get back to work, will you?\n(Applause)"
p3338
aa(lp3339
S"\nI'm going to talk today about energy and climate.\nAnd that might seem a bit surprising because\nmy full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,\nabout the things that we need to invent and deliver\nto help the poorest two billion live better lives.\nBut energy and climate are extremely important to these people --\nin fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.\nThe climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:\nThere will be too much rain, not enough rain,\nthings will change in ways\nthat their fragile environment simply can't support.\nAnd that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.\nSo, the climate changes will be terrible for them."
p3340
aS"\nAlso, the price of energy is very important to them.\nIn fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,\nto reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.\nNow, the price of energy has come down over time.\nReally advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.\nThe coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,\nand, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,\nand that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,\nwe can make modern materials and do so many things.\nAnd so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.\nBut, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --\nwe need to meet a new constraint,\nand that constraint has to do with CO2."
p3341
aS"\nCO2 is warming the planet,\nand the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.\nIf you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,\nthat leads to a temperature increase,\nand that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:\nthe effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,\nin that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,\nand so you get ecosystem collapses."
p3342
aS'\nNow, the exact amount of how you map\nfrom a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be\nand where the positive feedbacks are,\nthere\'s some uncertainty there, but not very much.\nAnd there\'s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,\nbut they will be extremely bad.\nI asked the top scientists on this several times:\nDo we really have to get down to near zero?\nCan\'t we just cut it in half or a quarter?\nAnd the answer is that until we get near to zero,\nthe temperature will continue to rise.\nAnd so that\'s a big challenge.\nIt\'s very different than saying "We\'re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,\nand we can just sort of squeeze under."\nThis is something that has to get to zero.'
p3343
aS"\nNow, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,\nover 26 billion tons.\nFor each American, it's about 20 tons;\nfor people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.\nIt's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.\nAnd, somehow, we have to make changes\nthat will bring that down to zero.\nIt's been constantly going up.\nIt's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,\nso we have to go from rapidly rising\nto falling, and falling all the way to zero."
p3344
aS"\nThis equation has four factors,\na little bit of multiplication:\nSo, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,\nand that's going to be based on the number of people,\nthe services each person's using on average,\nthe energy on average for each service,\nand the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.\nSo, let's look at each one of these\nand see how we can get this down to zero.\nProbably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.\nNow that's back from high school algebra,\nbut let's take a look."
p3345
aS"\nFirst, we've got population.\nThe world today has 6.8 billion people.\nThat's headed up to about nine billion.\nNow, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,\nhealth care, reproductive health services,\nwe could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,\nbut there we see an increase of about 1.3."
p3346
aS"\nThe second factor is the services we use.\nThis encompasses everything:\nthe food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.\nThese are very good things:\ngetting rid of poverty means providing these services\nto almost everyone on the planet.\nAnd it's a great thing for this number to go up.\nIn the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,\nwe probably could cut back and use less,\nbut every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,\nand so, over all, that will more than double\nthe services delivered per person.\nHere we have a very basic service:\nDo you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?\nAnd, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out\nand reading their school work under the street lamps."
p3347
aS"\nNow, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,\nhere finally we have some good news.\nWe have something that's not going up.\nThrough various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,\nthrough different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --\nthere are a lot of services where you can bring\nthe energy for that service down quite substantially.\nSome individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.\nThere are other services like how we make fertilizer,\nor how we do air transport,\nwhere the rooms for improvement are far, far less.\nAnd so, overall here, if we're optimistic,\nwe may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.\nBut for these first three factors now,\nwe've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,\nand that just won't cut it."
p3348
aS"\nSo let's look at this fourth factor --\nthis is going to be a key one --\nand this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.\nAnd so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?\nIf you burn coal, no.\nIf you burn natural gas, no.\nAlmost every way we make electricity today,\nexcept for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.\nAnd so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,\nis create a new system.\nAnd so, we need energy miracles."
p3349
aS'\nNow, when I use the term "miracle," I don\'t mean something that\'s impossible.\nThe microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.\nThe Internet and its services are a miracle.\nSo, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.\nUsually, we don\'t have a deadline,\nwhere you have to get the miracle by a certain date.\nUsually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don\'t.\nThis is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed\nand get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.'
p3350
aS'\nNow, I thought, "How could I really capture this?\nIs there some kind of natural illustration,\nsome demonstration that would grab people\'s imagination here?"\nI thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,\nand somehow people enjoyed that.\n(Laughter)\nIt really got them involved in the idea of,\nyou know, there are people who live with mosquitos.\nSo, with energy, all I could come up with is this.\nI decided that releasing fireflies\nwould be my contribution to the environment here this year.\nSo here we have some natural fireflies.\nI\'m told they don\'t bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.\n(Laughter)'
p3351
aS"\nNow, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,\nbut they don't really add up to much.\nWe need solutions -- either one or several --\nthat have unbelievable scale\nand unbelievable reliability,\nand, although there's many directions people are seeking,\nI really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.\nI've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.\nThose may make some contribution,\nand if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,\nbut my key point here\nis that we're going to have to work on each of these five,\nand we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,\nbecause they all have significant challenges."
p3352
aS"\nLet's look first at the burning fossil fuels,\neither burning coal or burning natural gas.\nWhat you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,\nand that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,\npressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,\nand hope it stays there.\nNow we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,\nbut getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,\nand agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,\nbut the toughest one here is this long-term issue.\nWho's going to be sure?\nWho's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger\nthan any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?\nThis is a lot of volume.\nSo that's a tough one."
p3353
aS"\nNext would be nuclear.\nIt also has three big problems:\nCost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;\nthe issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,\nthat, even though you have these human operators,\nthat the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.\nAnd then what do you do with the waste?\nAnd, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.\nPeople need to feel good about it.\nSo three very tough problems that might be solvable,\nand so, should be worked on."
p3354
aS"\nThe last three of the five, I've grouped together.\nThese are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.\nAnd they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --\nthey have some disadvantages.\nOne is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies\nis dramatically less than a power plant.\nThis is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,\nthousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.\nAlso, these are intermittent sources.\nThe sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,\nand, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.\nAnd so, if you depend on these sources,\nyou have to have some way of getting the energy\nduring those time periods that it's not available.\nSo, we've got big cost challenges here,\nwe have transmission challenges:\nfor example, say this energy source is outside your country;\nyou not only need the technology,\nbut you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere."
p3355
aS"\nAnd, finally, this storage problem.\nAnd, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at\nall the types of batteries that get made --\nfor cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --\nand compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,\nand what I found is that all the batteries we make now\ncould store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.\nAnd so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,\nsomething that's going to be a factor of 100 better\nthan the approaches we have now.\nIt's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.\nNow, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source\nto be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.\nIf you're counting on it for 100 percent,\nyou need an incredible miracle battery."
p3356
aS'\nNow, how we\'re going to go forward on this -- what\'s the right approach?\nIs it a Manhattan Project? What\'s the thing that can get us there?\nWell, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.\nIn each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.\nAnd a lot of them, you\'ll look at and say, "They\'re crazy." That\'s good.\nAnd, I think, here in the TED group,\nwe have many people who are already pursuing this.\nBill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar\nthat has some great solar thermal technologies.\nVinod Khosla\'s investing in dozens of companies\nthat are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,\nand I\'m trying to help back that.\nNathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company\nthat, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.\nThere are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.\nAnd innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,\nso the idea that there\'s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.'
p3357
aS'\nThe idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --\nthe one percent, which is the U235 --\nwe decided, "Let\'s burn the 99 percent, the U238."\nIt is kind of a crazy idea.\nIn fact, people had talked about it for a long time,\nbut they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,\nand so it\'s through the advent of modern supercomputers\nthat now you can simulate and see that, yes,\nwith the right material\'s approach, this looks like it would work.'
p3358
aS"\nAnd, because you're burning that 99 percent,\nyou have greatly improved cost profile.\nYou actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel\nall the leftover waste from today's reactors.\nSo, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.\nIt breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.\nYou can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.\nIn terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.\nI've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.\nThis is the leftover, the 99 percent,\nwhere they've taken out the part they burn now,\nso it's called depleted uranium.\nThat would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.\nAnd, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,\nyou'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet."
p3359
aS"\nSo, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,\nbut it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas\nthat we need to move forward.\nSo let's think: How should we measure ourselves?\nWhat should our report card look like?\nWell, let's go out to where we really need to get,\nand then look at the intermediate.\nFor 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.\nThat really is very important, that we get there.\nAnd that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,\nstill some agriculture,\nhopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.\nSo, to get to that 80 percent,\nthe developed countries, including countries like China,\nwill have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.\nSo, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,\nhave we deployed it in all the developed countries\nand we're in the process of getting it elsewhere?\nThat's super important.\nThat's a key element of making that report card."
p3360
aS"\nSo, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?\nWell, again, it should have the two elements.\nWe should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:\nThe less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,\nand, therefore, the less the temperature.\nBut in some ways, the grade we get there,\ndoing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,\nis only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,\nwhich is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs."
p3361
aS'\nThese breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,\nand we can measure that in terms of companies,\npilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.\nThere\'s a lot of great books that have been written about this.\nThe Al Gore book, "Our Choice"\nand the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."\nThey really go through it and create a framework\nthat this can be discussed broadly,\nbecause we need broad backing for this.\nThere\'s a lot that has to come together.'
p3362
aS"\nSo this is a wish.\nIt's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.\nIf you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --\nI could pick who's president,\nI could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,\nor I could pick that this thing\nthat's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --\nthis is the wish I would pick.\nThis is the one with the greatest impact.\nIf we don't get this wish,\nthe division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,\nbetween the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,\nand most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse."
p3363
aS"\nSo, what do we have to do?\nWhat am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?\nWe need to go for more research funding.\nWhen countries get together in places like Copenhagen,\nthey shouldn't just discuss the CO2.\nThey should discuss this innovation agenda,\nand you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending\non these innovative approaches.\nWe do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --\nsomething that gets that price signal out there.\nWe need to get the message out.\nWe need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,\nincluding the steps that the government takes.\nThis is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve."
p3364
aS'\nThank you.\n(Applause)\nThank you.'
p3365
aS'\nChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.\n(Applause)\nThank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --\nI mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?'
p3366
aS"\nBil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,\nhire all the great scientists, which we've done,\nthat's only tens of millions,\nand even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor\nto make sure that our materials work properly,\nthen you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.\nThe tough thing is building the pilot reactor;\nfinding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location\nthat will actually build the first one of these.\nOnce you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,\nthen it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,\nare so different than nuclear as we know it."
p3367
aS'\nCA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground\nalmost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,\nof this sort of spent uranium,\nand then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?'
p3368
aS"\nBG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,\nso you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:\nthat thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out,\nthat's not good.\nSo, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --\njust think of it as a log --\nput it down and not have those same complexities.\nAnd it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done."
p3369
aS"\nCA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution."
p3370
aS"\nBG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,\nyou can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --\nthen you can actually take that,\nand put it into another one and burn that.\nAnd we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,\nthat's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --\nthat's our fuel to begin with.\nSo, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors\nis actually what gets fed into ours,\nand you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically\nas you're going through this process."
p3371
aS"\nCA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world\nabout the possibilities here.\nWhere is there most interest in actually doing something with this?"
p3372
aS'\nBG: Well, we haven\'t picked a particular place,\nand there\'s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that\'s called "nuclear,"\nso we\'ve got a lot of interest,\nthat people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --\nI\'ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here,\ntalking about how this fits into the energy agenda.\nSo I\'m optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.\nThis is a variant on something that has been done.\nIt\'s an important advance, but it\'s like a fast reactor,\nand a lot of countries have built them,\nso anybody who\'s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.'
p3373
aS'\nCA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood\nof actually taking something like this live?'
p3374
aS"\nBG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things\nthat's very cheap,\nwe have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.\nThat's sort of the deadline that the environmental models\nhave shown us that we have to meet.\nAnd, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --\ncould easily meet that.\nAnd there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --\nwe need it to be hundreds --\nwho, likewise, if their science goes well,\nif the funding for their pilot plants goes well,\nthat they can compete for this.\nAnd it's best if multiple succeed,\nbecause then you could use a mix of these things.\nWe certainly need one to succeed."
p3375
aS"\nCA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes,\nis this the biggest that you're aware of out there?"
p3376
aS"\nBG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.\nIt would have been, even without the environmental constraint,\nbut the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.\nIn the nuclear space, there are other innovators.\nYou know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,\nbut the modular people, that's a different approach.\nThere's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,\nbut maybe they say that about us.\nAnd so, there are different ones,\nbut the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium\nhas a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,\nand so -- if you can deal with the negatives,\nwhich are essentially the radiation --\nthe footprint and cost, the potential,\nin terms of effect on land and various things,\nis almost in a class of its own."
p3377
aS"\nCA: If this doesn't work, then what?\nDo we have to start taking emergency measures\nto try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?"
p3378
aS"\nBG: If you get into that situation,\nit's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:\nThen where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.\nThere is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,\nwhich are various techniques that would delay the heating\nto buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.\nNow, that's just an insurance policy.\nYou hope you don't need to do that.\nSome people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy\nbecause it might make you lazy,\nthat you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.\nI'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,\nbut there's now the geoengineering discussion\nabout -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,\nor this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?"
p3379
aS"\nCA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,\nhow might you persuade them that they're wrong?"
p3380

aS'\nAnd so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,\nthe idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,\nand a somewhat uncertain pain thing --\nin fact, the IPCC report, that\'s not necessarily the worst case,\nand there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC\nand say, "OK, that isn\'t that big of a deal."\nThe fact is it\'s that uncertain part that should move us towards this.\nBut my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,\nand meet the CO2 constraints,\nthen the skeptics say, "OK,\nI don\'t care that it doesn\'t put out CO2,\nI kind of wish it did put out CO2,\nbut I guess I\'ll accept it because it\'s cheaper than what\'s come before."\n(Applause)'
p3382
aS"\nCA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,\nthat basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,\nit's going to take away all your other goals\nof trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,\nit's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that\nwhen there are better things we can do."
p3383
aS'\nBG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece --\nsay the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --\nit\'s not that dramatic.\nIt shouldn\'t take away from other things.\nThe thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,\nis when you have something that\'s non-economic and you\'re trying to fund that --\nthat, to me, mostly is a waste.\nUnless you\'re very close and you\'re just funding the learning curve\nand it\'s going to get very cheap,\nI believe we should try more things that have a potential\nto be far less expensive.\nIf the trade-off you get into is, "Let\'s make energy super expensive,"\nthen the rich can afford that.\nI mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy\nand not change our lifestyle.\nThe disaster is for that two billion.'

S"\nI write about food. I write about cooking.\nI take it quite seriously,\nbut I'm here to talk about something\nthat's become very important to me in the last year or two.\nIt is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.\nI'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.\nI'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?\nBut I still think that this --\n(Laughter)\n-- may be this year's version of this."
p3389
aS"\nNow, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.\nAnd why do I say it?\nBecause only once before has the fate of individual people\nand the fate of all of humanity\nbeen so intertwined.\nThere was the bomb, and there's now.\nAnd where we go from here is going to determine\nnot only the quality and the length of our individual lives,\nbut whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,\nwe'd recognize it.\nIt's a holocaust of a different kind,\nand hiding under our desks isn't going to help.\nStart with the notion that global warming\nis not only real, but dangerous.\nSince every scientist in the world now believes this,\nand even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,\nwe can take this is a given."
p3390
aS"\nThen hear this, please.\nAfter energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor\nto atmosphere-altering gases.\nNearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas\nis generated by livestock production --\nmore than transportation.\nNow, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,\nbut methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,\nand it's not just methane.\nLivestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,\nair and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.\nThere's more.\nLike half the antibiotics in this country\nare not administered to people, but to animals.\nBut lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:\nif you're a progressive,\nif you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,\nor you're looking for organic,\nyou should probably be a semi-vegetarian.\nNow, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,\nbut it's all in the way we use these things.\nThere's another piece of the puzzle,\nwhich Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,\nand one you already know."
p3391
aS"\nThere's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --\ndiabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --\nare diseases that are far more prevalent here\nthan anywhere in the rest of the world.\nAnd that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.\nOur demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --\nthe world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --\nour demand for these things, not our need, our want,\ndrives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.\nAnd those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.\nNow global warming was unforeseen.\nWe didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.\nMaybe a few lung diseases here and there,\nbut, you know, that's not such a big deal.\nThe current health crisis, however,\nis a little more the work of the evil empire.\nWe were told, we were assured,\nthat the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,\nthe healthier we'd be."
p3392
aS"\nNo. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,\nis the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.\nNow, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,\nbut the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --\nit's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.\nIt's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health.\nThis evidence is overwhelming at this point.\nYou eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.\nNot bad.\nBut back to animals and junk food.\nWhat do they have in common?\nOne: we don't need either of them for health.\nWe don't need animal products,\nand we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.\nTwo: both have been marketed heavily,\ncreating unnatural demand.\nWe're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.\nThree: their production has been supported by government agencies\nat the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet."
p3393
aS"\nNow, let's imagine a parallel.\nLet's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,\nwhile discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,\nknowing all the while that the result would be\npollution, war and rising costs.\nIncredible, isn't it?\nYet they do that.\nAnd they do this here. It's the same deal.\nThe sad thing is, when it comes to diet,\nis that even when well-intentioned Feds\ntry to do right by us, they fail.\nEither they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,\nor they are puppets of agribusiness.\nSo, when the USDA finally acknowledged\nthat it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,\nthey encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,\nto eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,\nalong with more carbs.\nWhat they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,\nand that plants and whole grains\nshould be supplanting eating junk food.\nBut industry lobbyists would never let that happen.\nAnd guess what?\nHalf the people who developed the food pyramid\nhave ties to agribusiness.\nSo, instead of substituting plants for animals,\nour swollen appetites simply became larger,\nand the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.\nSo-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --\nthese are not solutions."
p3394
aS"\nBut with lots of intelligent people\nfocusing on whether food is organic or local,\nor whether we're being nice to animals,\nthe most important issues just aren't being addressed.\nNow, don't get me wrong.\nI like animals,\nand I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production\nand to churn them out like they were wrenches.\nBut there's no way to treat animals well,\nwhen you're killing 10 billion of them a year.\nThat's our number. 10 billion.\nIf you strung all of them --\nchickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,\nthey'd go there and back five times, there and back.\nNow, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,\nand it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,\nbut you get the idea.\nThat's just the United States.\nAnd with our hyper-consumption of those animals\nproducing greenhouse gases and heart disease,\nkindness might just be a bit of a red herring.\nLet's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,\nand then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left."
p3395
aS'\nAnother red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"\nwhich was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.\nSeriously.\nAnd locavore, for those of you who don\'t know,\nis someone who eats only locally grown food --\nwhich is fine if you live in California,\nbut for the rest of us it\'s a bit of a sad joke.\nBetween the official story -- the food pyramid --\nand the hip locavore vision,\nyou have two versions of how to improve our eating.\n(Laughter).'
p3396
aS"\nThey both get it wrong, though.\nThe first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.\nHow we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.\nAnd I'm going to go through that,\nat least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.\nA hundred years ago, guess what?\nEveryone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,\nand shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.\nEvery family had a cook, usually a mom.\nAnd those moms bought and prepared food.\nIt was like your romantic vision of Europe.\nMargarine didn't exist.\nIn fact, when margarine was invented,\nseveral states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,\nso we'd all know that it was a fake.\nThere was no snack food, and until the '20s,\nuntil Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.\nThere were no restaurant chains.\nThere were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,\nbut none of them would think to open another one.\nEating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.\nAnd fancy food was entirely French.\nAs an aside, those of you who remember\nDan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations\ncan see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.\n(Laughter)"
p3397
aS"\nBack in those days, before even Julia,\nback in those days, there was no philosophy of food.\nYou just ate.\nYou didn't claim to be anything.\nThere was no marketing. There were no national brands.\nVitamins had not been invented.\nThere were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.\nFats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.\nYou ate food.\nHardly anything contained more than one ingredient,\nbecause it was an ingredient.\nThe cornflake hadn't been invented.\n(Laughter)\nThe Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.\nGoldfish swam.\n(Laughter)\nIt's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.\nAnd again, everyone ate local.\nIn New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,\nbecause it came all the way from Florida.\nFrom the '30s on, road systems expanded,\ntrucks took the place of railroads,\nfresh food began to travel more.\nOranges became common in New York.\nThe South and West became agricultural hubs,\nand in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.\nThe effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.\nAnd the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,\nas is almost everything\nfrom the demise of the real community\nto the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.\nEventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,\nso it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.\nThus arrived convenience.\nIt was sold to proto-feminist housewives\nas a way to cut down on housework."
p3398
aS"\nNow, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --\ntheir mouths are watering at this point.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nIf we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?\n(Laughter)\nBut this may have cut down on housework,\nbut it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.\nMany of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable\nexcept the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.\nI, for one -- and I'm not kidding --\ndidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.\nWho needed it though? Meat was everywhere.\nWhat could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family\nthan broiling a steak?\nBut by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.\nRather than spending their lives eating grass,\nfor which their stomachs were designed,\nthey were forced to eat soy and corn.\nThey have trouble digesting those grains, of course,\nbut that wasn't a problem for producers.\nNew drugs kept them healthy.\nWell, they kept them alive.\nHealthy was another story."
p3399
aS"\nThanks to farm subsidies,\nthe fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,\nsoy, corn and cattle became king.\nAnd chicken soon joined them on the throne.\nIt was during this period that the cycle of\ndietary and planetary destruction began,\nthe thing we're only realizing just now.\nListen to this,\nbetween 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.\nMeat consumption increased five-fold.\nNow, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.\nAnd this took care of the situation resoundingly.\nHome cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.\nThere were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,\nbecause all of them could be bought at any store.\nNot that they were any good, but they were there.\nMost moms cooked like mine:\na piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,\ncanned soup, canned fruit salad.\nMaybe baked or mashed potatoes,\nor perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.\nFor dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.\nMy mom is not here, so I can say this now.\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.\n(Laughter)"
p3400
aS"\nIt wasn't all bad.\nBy the '70s, forward-thinking people\nbegan to recognize the value of local ingredients.\nWe tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,\nwe knew or we were vegetarians.\nWe weren't all hippies, either.\nSome of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.\nMeanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.\nPerhaps because it was being produced rationally,\nas if it were plastic,\nfood gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.\nMany people became fat-phobic.\nOthers worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.\nBut mostly they didn't eat broccoli.\nInstead they were sold on yogurt,\nyogurt being almost as good as broccoli.\nExcept, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt\nwas to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.\nSimilarly, let's look at a granola bar.\nYou think that that might be healthy food,\nbut in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,\nit's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.\nSadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,\nif not actually killed --\nthe beginning of the heyday of value-added food,\nwhich contained as many soy and corn products\nas could be crammed into it."
p3401
aS"\nThink of the frozen chicken nugget.\nThe chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,\nand mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,\nand then it's fried in corn oil.\nAll you do is nuke it. What could be better?\nAnd zapped horribly, pathetically.\nBy the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state\nthat the high fat and spice contents of foods\nlike McNuggets and Hot Pockets --\nand we all have our favorites, actually --\nmade this stuff more appealing than the bland things\nthat people were serving at home.\nAt the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,\nand cooking simply wasn't important enough\nfor men to share the burden.\nSo now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,\nyou've got your grazing nights,\nyou've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on."
p3402
aS"\nLeading the way -- what's leading the way?\nMeat, junk food, cheese:\nthe very stuff that will kill you.\nSo, now we clamor for organic food.\nThat's good.\nAnd as evidence that things can actually change,\nyou can now find organic food in supermarkets,\nand even in fast-food outlets.\nBut organic food isn't the answer either,\nat least not the way it's currently defined.\nLet me pose you a question.\nCan farm-raised salmon be organic,\nwhen its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,\neven if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves\nare packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?\nAnd if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there\nand then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,\ndumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?\nI don't know.\nPacked in Styrofoam, of course,\nbefore landing somewhere in the United States,\nand then being trucked a few hundred more miles.\nThis may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.\nNow here is where we all meet.\nThe locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,\nthe vegans, the gourmets\nand those of us who are just plain interested in good food.\nEven though we've come to this from different points,\nwe all have to act on our knowledge\nto change the way that everyone thinks about food."
p3403
aS"\nWe need to start acting.\nAnd this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --\nand, of course, she's completely right --\nbut it's also one of global survival.\nWhich bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,\nthe overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.\nAs I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases\nare attributed to livestock production.\nHow much livestock do you need to produce this?\n70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,\n30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted\nto raising the animals we'll eat.\nAnd this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so."
p3404
aS"\nAnd if the numbers coming in from China\nare anything like what they look like now,\nit's not going to be 40 years.\nThere is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.\nAnd I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.\nThe most common argument is that we need nutrients --\neven though we eat, on average, twice as much protein\nas even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.\nBut listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction\nrecommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week."
p3405
aS"\nWhat do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.\nBut don't we need meat to be big and strong?\nIsn't meat eating essential to health?\nWon't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables\nturn us into godless, sissy, liberals?\n(Laughter)\nSome of us might think that would be a good thing.\nBut, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,\nthe answer is no.\nIn fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets\nbasic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,\nand many will make you much healthier than ours does.\nWe don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,\nwe eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.\nTo suggest that in the interests of personal and human health\nAmericans eat 50 percent less meat --\nit's not enough of a cut, but it's a start."
p3406
aS"\nIt would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,\nand what progressive people, forward-thinking people\nshould be doing and advocating,\nalong with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.\nI've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --\none might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.\nDuring that time, I've eaten\nand recommended eating just about everything.\nI'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,\nbut I do think that for the benefit of everyone,\nthe time has come to stop raising them industrially\nand stop eating them thoughtlessly."
p3407
aS"\nAnn Cooper's right.\nThe USDA is not our ally here.\nWe have to take matters into our own hands,\nnot only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --\nand that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.\nAnd that happens to be quite easy.\nLess meat, less junk, more plants.\nIt's a simple formula: eat food.\nEat real food.\nWe can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,\nand we can eat even better.\nWe can continue the search for the ingredients we love,\nand we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.\nWe'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.\nWe can make food more important, not less,\nand save ourselves by doing so.\nWe have to choose that path.\nThank you."

Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --\n(Laughter)\n-- actually, my technique is to peek,\nall the time.\nWhen I lift the heap, I peek.\nYou see, yeah, perfect.\nThree, four, five, six.

p3431
aS'\nAnother person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)'

aS"\n(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.\nExcellent.

aS'\n(Audience: Queen of hearts.)'

p3446
aS'\nZoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.'
p3447
aS"\nSo, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.\nThe false count -- and the number\none, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, eight --\nyou say the same card all the time.\nEight, nine, 10.\nThis is a kind of optical deal, right?\nWhen I put one card at a table --\nlook, it's not one card. It's -- look,\nit's a bunch of cards that gives this\nimpression.\nYeah.\nNow some hard stuff.\nI think we keep the queen here, yes.\nNow, to the satellites things.\nThis --\noh sorry, don't look at the beam.

p3448
aS"\nThis is high-frequency laser,\nand it's enough with a fraction of a second\nto destroy the retina completely.\nRight, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.\nBut you can relax,\nbecause it takes half an hour before it works,\nso you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.\n(Laughter)\nNow,\nI put the laser here,\nand --\nnow, when I deal the cards in the laser,\nI know where they are but -- yes?\nDid the camera got it?\nNo?\nThey didn't?\nWhat happened?"

So now, to find the queen,\ndo it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.\n(Laughter)\nYeah, interesting,\nbut a little dangerous.\n(Laughter)\nI liked it.

p3453
aS'\n(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.'
p3454
aS"\nSo here,\nhere I have to peek, lots of cards.\nI think there are lots of --\nI don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?\n(Laughter)\nSo every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.\nThen I arrange them so I can\nget them quick.\nPerfect, excellent.\nSo I start with the ace --\nyeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?\nSame mistake as before, right?\nSo -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.\nI try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.\nYou see, I don't work with prestige,\nso always do mistakes.\nIt doesn't matter to me.\nAnd now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?\nOne,\ntwo, three, four -- yes,\nthe camera got it? Five, six,\nseven, eight --\nah --\nnine, 10,\nthe jack,\njack of spades,\nqueen of --\nI like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.\n(Laughter)\nWait, wait, wait -- please take any card.\nGrab any one.

p3457

Zoe: OK.\nLG: OK, now.\nDo with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.\n(Laughter)\nI think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.\nSo here,\ndiamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.\nStop. Do you see the pattern?\nNo? Now?\nYes, yes, OK.\nI work with pattern.\nOh sorry, I dropped one.\nMaybe it's important --\nyeah --\nnine of diamonds, OK.\nSo now --\nI always ask,\nwhy do I put myself in this position?\nI have to figure out so many outs,\nwhen I miss some cards, but\nI love it. So now,\nI will do it. I will try to find\nthe diamonds,\nbut I will do it the hard way.\nIt's too easy to do it right away, right?\nI think I will do it ...\nblindfolded.\nAt this distance, it works immediately.\nAargh!\n(Laughter)"
p3463

Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.\n(Laughter)\nYeah, good. Yeah.\nYou can take the nostril too, because some guys think --\n(Laughter)\n-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do\nmore. Go, go.\nRight? Good.\nSatisfied?\nLooks good, like Batman. Ow!\n(Laughter)\nNo, with dignity and elegance, right?\nBut I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.\nAnd it was OK.

There's a Lebanese.\nYeah? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room."
p3483
aS'\nI said, "Where are the Qataris?" (Laughter)\n(Applause)'
p3484
aS'\nThey said, "No, no, it\'s too hot. They come out later. They\'re smart."\n(Laughter) "They know."'
p3485
aS'\nAnd of course it\'s growing so fast, sometimes there\'s growing pains.\nYou know, like sometimes you run into people that you think\nknow the city well, but they don\'t know it that well.\nMy Indian cab driver showed up at the W,\nand I asked him to take me to the Sheraton,\nand he said, "No problem, sir."\nAnd then we sat there for two minutes.'
p3486
aS'\nI said, "What\'s wrong?"He said, "One problem, sir."'
p3487
aS'\nI said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"\n(Laughter)'
p3488
aS'\nI go, "You\'re the driver, you should know."He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."\nI go, "You just arrived at the W?""No, I just arrived in Doha, sir.\nI was on my way home from the airport. I got a job.\nI\'m working already."\nHe goes, "Sir, why don\'t you drive?"'
p3489
aS'\nI go, "I don\'t know where we\'re going."\n"Neither do I. It will be an adventure, sir."'
p3490
aS'\nIt is an adventure. The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple years.\nThe Middle East is going crazy with the Arab Spring\nand revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese here tonight?\nAny Lebanese by applause? (Applause) Lebanese.\nYeah. The Middle East is going crazy.\nYou know the Middle East is going crazy\nwhen Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nWho would have thought? Oh my gosh.'
p3491
aS'\nNo. There\'s serious issues in the region.\nSome people don\'t want to talk about them. I\'m here to talk about them tonight.\nLadies and gentlemen of the Middle East,\nhere\'s a serious issue. When we see each other,\nwhen we say hello, how many kisses are we going to do?\nEvery country is different and it\'s confusing, okay?\nIn Lebanon, they do three. In Egypt, they do two.\nI was in Lebanon, I got used to three.\nI went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy,\nI went, one, two. I went for three. He wasn\'t into it.\n(Laughter)\nI told him, I said, "No, no, no, I was just in Lebanon."\nHe goes, "I don\'t care where you were. You just stay where you are, please. Just stay where you are."\nI went to Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two,\nand then they stay on the same side -- three, four, five, six,\nseven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n(Laughter)\nNext time you see a Saudi, look closely.

p3495
aS'\nEvery country  Iranians, sometimes we do two, sometimes we do three.\nA friend of mine explained to me, before the \'79 revolution,\nit was two. After the revolution, three.\nSo with Iranians, you can tell whose side the person is on\nbased on the number of kisses they give you.\nYeah, if you go one, two, three -- "I can\'t believe you support this regime\nwith your three kisses."'
p3496
aS'\nBut no, guys, really, it is exciting to be here,\nand like I said, you guys are doing a lot culturally,\nyou know, and it\'s amazing, and it helps change the image\nof the Middle East in the West. Like a lot of Americans\ndon\'t know a lot about us, about the Middle East.\nI\'m Iranian and American. I\'m there. I know, I\'ve traveled here.\nThere\'s so much, we laugh, right?\nPeople don\'t know we laugh. When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour,\nit came out on Comedy Central, I went online\nto see what people were saying about it. I ended up on a conservative website.\nOne guy wrote another guy. He said, "I never knew these people laughed."\nThink about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?\nMaybe like an evil -- like, "Wuhahaha, wuhahaha. (Laughter)\nI will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha."\nBut never like, "ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."'
p3497
aS"\nWe like to laugh. We like to celebrate life.\nAnd I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends:\nTravel, see the Middle East, there's so much to see, so many good people.\nAnd it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems\nof misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening."
p3498
aS'\nFor example, I don\'t know if you heard about this,\na little while ago in the U.S. there was a Muslim family\nwalking down the aisle of an airplane\ntalking about the safest place to sit on the plane.\nSome passengers overheard them, somehow misconstrued\nthat as terrorist talk, got them kicked off the plane.\nIt was a family, a mother, father, child, walking down the aisle,\ntalking about the seating. Now as a Middle Eastern male,\nI know there\'s certain things I\'m not supposed to say\non an airplane in the U.S., right?\nI\'m not supposed to be, like, walking down the aisle,\nand be like, "Hi, Jack." You know, that\'s not cool.\nEven if I\'m there with my friend named Jack, I say,\n"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."\nNever "Hi, Jack."\n(Laughter)\nBut now apparently we can\'t even talk about\nthe safest place to sit on an airplane.'
p3499
aS'\nSo my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends\nand anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim,\nso to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone,\nif you\'re brown --\nhere\'s my advice to my brown friends.\nThe next time you\'re on an airplane in the U.S.,\njust speak your mother tongue.\nThat way no one knows what you\'re saying. Life goes on.\nGranted, some mother tongues might sound\na little threatening to the average American, right?\nIf you\'re walking down the aisle speaking Arabic,\nyou might freak them out, if you\'re walking, "[Arabic],"\nthey might say, "What\'s he talking about?"\nSo the key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,\nyou gotta throw in random good words to put people at ease\nas you\'re walking down the aisle.\nJust as you\'re walking down: "[Imitating Arabic] --\nstrawberry!"\n(Laughter)\n"[Imitating Arabic] -- rainbow!"\n"[Imitating Arabic] -- Tutti Frutti!"'

S"\nI wanted to be a rock star.\nI dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.\nTo be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.\nThis was in the late '80s.\nAnd mostly I wanted to be the fifth member\nof Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.\nThey wouldn't have me.\nI didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.\nAnd I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.\nAnd I was certain that's what my life would be."
p3504
aS'\nAnd when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas\nwhen I was 18,\nI was stunned to find\nthat there was not a Pop Star 101,\nor even a degree program for that interest.\nAnd the choir conductor there\nknew that I sang\nand invited me to come and join the choir.\nAnd I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."\nAnd I left the room and said, "No way."\nThe choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,\nand there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.\nAnd about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,\n"Listen, you\'ve got to join choir.\nAt the end of the semester, we\'re taking a trip to Mexico,\nall expenses paid.\nAnd the soprano section is just full of hot girls."\nAnd so I figured for Mexico and babes,\nI could do just about anything.'
p3505
aS'\nAnd I went to my first day in choir,\nand I sat down with the basses\nand sort of looked over my shoulder\nto see what they were doing.\nThey opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,\nand boom, they launched into the Kyrie\nfrom the "Requiem" by Mozart.\nIn my entire life I had seen in black and white,\nand suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.\nThe most transformative experience I\'ve ever had --\nin that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony\nand people singing, people together,\nthe shared vision.\nAnd I felt for the first time in my life\nthat I was part of something bigger than myself.\nAnd there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.'
p3506
aS"\nI decided to write a piece for choir\na couple of years later\nas a gift to this conductor\nwho had changed my life.\nI had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.\nAnd that piece was published,\nand then I wrote another piece, and that got published.\nAnd then I started conducting,\nand I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.\nAnd I find myself now in the unlikely position\nof standing in front of all of you\nas a professional classical composer and conductor."
p3507
aS'\nWell a couple of years ago,\na friend of mine emailed me\na link, a YouTube link,\nand said, "You have got to see this."\nAnd it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,\nsinging the soprano line\nto a piece of mine called "Sleep."'
p3508
aS'\n(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.\nMy name is Britlin Losee,\nand this is a video\nthat I\'d like to make for you.\nHere\'s me singing "Sleep."\nI\'m a little nervous, just to let you know.\n If there are noises \n in the night '
p3509
aS'\nEric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.\nBritlin was so innocent and so sweet,\nand her voice was so pure.\nAnd I even loved seeing behind her;\nI could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.\nSuch an intimate video.'
p3510
aS'\nAnd I had this idea: if I could get 50 people\nto all do this same thing,\nsing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --\nwherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,\nwe could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.\nSo I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."\nI actually wrote, "OMG,"\nhopefully for the last time in public ever.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I sent out this call to singers.\nAnd I made free the download of the music\nto a piece that I had written in the year 2000\ncalled "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."\nAnd lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.'
p3511
aS"\nNow I should say, before that,\nwhat I did is I posted a conductor track\nof myself conducting.\nAnd it's in complete silence when I filmed it,\nbecause I was only hearing the music in my head,\nimagining the choir that would one day come to be.\nAfterwards, I played a piano track underneath\nso that the singers would have something to listen to.\nAnd then as the videos started to come in ..."

p3518
aS'\nThere was even a little soprano solo in the piece,\nand so I had auditions.\nAnd a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.\nI was told later,\nand also by lots of singers who were involved in this,\nthat they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes\nuntil they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.\nHere\'s our winner of the soprano solo.\nThis is Melody Myers from Tennessee.\n(Singing)\nI love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --\nlike, "No problem, everything\'s fine."'

I\'m so glad that you found me."\nAnd Scott aggregated all of the videos.\nHe scrubbed the audio.\nHe made sure that everything lined up.\nAnd then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.\nThis is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.'

p3530
aS'\nAnd we also put a page on Facebook\nfor the singers to upload their testimonials,\nwhat it was like for them, their experience singing it.\nAnd I\'ve just chosen a few of them here.\n"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.\nNow she\'s an airman in the air force constantly traveling.\nIt\'s so wonderful to sing together again!"\nI love the idea that she\'s singing with her sister.\n"Aside from the beautiful music,\nit\'s great just to know I\'m part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,\nbut who are connected anyway."\nAnd my personal favorite,\n"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,\nhe told me that I did not have the voice for it."\nYeah, I\'m sure a lot of you have heard that too.\nMe too.\n"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,\nbut something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.\nIt is a dream come true to be part of this choir,\nas I\'ve never been part of one.\nWhen I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,\nI had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.\nAs I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,\nsatellite is my connection to the world."'
p3531
aS"\nSo two things struck me deeply about this.\nThe first is that human beings\nwill go to any lengths necessary\nto find and connect with each other.\nIt doesn't matter the technology.\nAnd the second is\nthat people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.\nIt wasn't a virtual choir.\nThere are people now online that are friends; they've never met.\nBut, I know myself too, I feel\nthis virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.\nI feel a closeness to this choir --\nalmost like a family."

S"\nI and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others,\nhave put 37 people who are madly in love\ninto a functional MRI brain scanner.\n17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped,\nand we're just starting our third experiment:\nstudying people who report that they're still in love\nafter 10 to 25 years of marriage.\nSo, this is the short story of that research."
p3538
aS"\nIn the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.\nIt was built by the grandest Sun King,\nof the grandest city-state,\nof the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.\nHis name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.\nHe stood over six feet tall.\nHe lived into his 80s,\nand he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.\nAnd Mayan inscriptions proclaim\nthat he was deeply in love with his wife.\nSo, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.\nAnd every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox,\nthe sun rises behind his temple,\nand perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.\nAnd as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon,\nit perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.\nAfter 1,300 years, these two lovers\nstill touch and kiss from their tomb."
p3539
aS'\nAround the world, people love.\nThey sing for love, they dance for love,\nthey compose poems and stories about love.\nThey tell myths and legends about love.\nThey pine for love, they live for love,\nthey kill for love, and they die for love.\nAs Walt Whitman once said,\nhe said, "Oh, I would stake all for you."\nAnthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.\nThey\'ve never found a society that did not have it.'
p3540
aS'\nBut love isn\'t always a happy experience.\nIn one study of college students,\nthey asked a lot of questions about love,\nbut the two that stood out to me the most were,\n"Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"\nAnd the second question was,\n"Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"\nAnd almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.\nAlmost nobody gets out of love alive.'
p3541
aS'\nSo, before I start telling you about the brain,\nI want to read for you\nwhat I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.\nThere\'s other love poems that are, of course, just as good,\nbut I don\'t think this one can be surpassed.\nIt was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska\nto a missionary in 1896, and here it is.\nI\'ve never had the opportunity to say it before.\n"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.\nPain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.\nPain like a boil about to burst with my love for you,\nconsumed by fire with my love for you.\nI remember what you said to me.\nI am thinking of your love for me.\nI am torn by your love for me.\nPain and more pain --\nwhere are you going with my love?\nI am told you will go from here.\nI am told you will leave me here.\nMy body is numb with grief.\nRemember what I said, my love.\nGoodbye, my love, goodbye."\nEmily Dickinson once wrote,\n"Parting is all we need to know of hell."\nHow many people have suffered\nin all the millions of years of human evolution?\nHow many people around the world\nare dancing with elation at this very minute?\nRomantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.'
p3542
aS"\nSo, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain\nand study this madness.\nOur first study of people who were happily in love\nhas been widely publicized,\nso I'm only going to say a very little about it.\nWe found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain\ncalled the ventral tegmental area.\nWe found activity in some cells called the A10 cells,\ncells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant,\nand spray it to many brain regions.\nIndeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.\nIt's way below your cognitive thinking process.\nIt's below your emotions.\nIt's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,\nassociated with wanting, with motivation,\nwith focus and with craving.\nIn fact, the same brain region where we found activity\nbecomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine."
p3543
aS'\nBut romantic love is much more than a cocaine high --\nat least you come down from cocaine.\nRomantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.\nYou lose your sense of self.\nYou can\'t stop thinking about another human being.\nSomebody is camping in your head.\nAs an eighth-century Japanese poet said,\n"My longing had no time when it ceases."\nWild is love.\nAnd the obsession can get worse when you\'ve been rejected.'
p3544
aS'\nSo, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project,\nare looking at the data of the people\nwho were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.\nIt was very difficult actually,\nputting these people in the machine,\nbecause they were in such bad shape.\n(Laughter)\nSo anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.\nWe found activity in the brain region,\nin exactly the same brain region\nassociated with intense romantic love.\nWhat a bad deal.\nYou know, when you\'ve been dumped,\nthe one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being,\nand then go on with your life --\nbut no, you just love them harder.\nAs the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said,\nhe said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."\nAnd indeed, we now know why.\nTwo thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.\nThat brain system -- the reward system\nfor wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus --\nbecomes more active when you can\'t get what you want.\nIn this case, life\'s greatest prize:\nan appropriate mating partner.'
p3545
aS'\nWe found activity in other brain regions also --\nin a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.\nYou know, you\'re lying there, you\'re looking at the picture,\nand you\'re in this machine,\nand you\'re calculating, you know, what went wrong.\nHow, you know, what have I lost?\nAs a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.\nIt comes from a David Mamet play,\nand there\'s two con artists in the play,\nand the woman is conning the man,\nand the man looks at the woman and says,\n"Oh, you\'re a bad pony, I\'m not going to bet on you."\nAnd indeed, it\'s this part of the brain,\nthe core of the nucleus accumbens, actually, that is becoming active\nas you\'re measuring your gains and losses.\nIt\'s also the brain region that becomes active\nwhen you\'re willing to take enormous risks\nfor huge gains and huge losses.'
p3546
aS"\nLast but not least, we found activity in a brain region\nassociated with deep attachment to another individual.\nNo wonder people suffer around the world,\nand we have so many crimes of passion.\nWhen you've been rejected in love,\nnot only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love,\nbut you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.\nMoreover, this brain circuit for reward is working,\nand you're feeling intense energy, intense focus,\nintense motivation and the willingness to risk it all\nto win life's greatest prize."
p3547
aS'\nSo, what have I learned from this experiment\nthat I would like to tell the world?\nForemost, I have come to think\nthat romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.\nNot the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you out there,\nlooking for a whole range of partners.\nRomantic love enables you to focus your mating energy\non just one at a time, conserve your mating energy,\nand start the mating process with this single individual.\nI think of all the poetry that I\'ve read about romantic love,\nwhat sums it up best is something that is said by Plato,\nover 2,000 years ago.\nHe said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.\nIt is a need. It is an urge.\nIt is a homeostatic imbalance.\nLike hunger and thirst, it\'s almost impossible to stamp out."\nI\'ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction:\na perfectly wonderful addiction when it\'s going well,\nand a perfectly horrible addiction when it\'s going poorly.'
p3548
aS"\nAnd indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.\nYou focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,\nyou crave them, you distort reality,\nyour willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.\nAnd it's got the three main characteristics of addiction:\ntolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more;\nwithdrawals; and last, relapse.\nI've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.\nIt's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.\nAnd she was driving along in her car the other day,\nand suddenly she heard a song on the car radio\nthat reminded her of this man.\nAnd she -- not only did the instant craving come back,\nbut she had to pull over\nfrom the side of the road and cry.\nSo, one thing I would like the medical community,\nand the legal community, and even the college community,\nto see if they can understand, that indeed,\nromantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth."
p3549
aS'\nI would also like to tell the world that animals love.\nThere\'s not an animal on this planet\nthat will copulate with anything that comes along.\nToo old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won\'t do it.\nUnless you\'re stuck in a laboratory cage --\nand you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box,\nyou\'re not going to be as picky about who you have sex with --\nbut I\'ve looked in a hundred species,\nand everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.\nAs a matter of fact ethologists know this.\nThere are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"\nselective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.\nAnd indeed, there are now three academic articles\nin which they\'ve looked at this attraction,\nwhich may only last for a second,\nbut it\'s a definite attraction,\nand either this same brain region, this reward system,\nor the chemicals of that reward system are involved.\nIn fact, I think animal attraction can be instant --\nyou can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.\nAnd I think that this is really the origin\nof what you and I call "love at first sight."'
p3550
aS'\nPeople have often asked me whether\nwhat I know about love has spoiled it for me.\nAnd I just simply say, "Hardly."\nYou can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake,\nand then when you sit down and eat that cake,\nyou can still feel that joy.\nAnd certainly, I make all the same mistakes\nthat everybody else does too,\nbut it\'s really deepened my understanding\nand compassion, really, for all human life.\nAs a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself\nlooking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.\nAnd in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry\nfor the chicken on my dinner plate,\nwhen I think of how intense this brain system is.\nOur newest experiment has been hatched\nby my colleague, Art Aron --\nputting people who are reporting that they are still in love,\nin a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.\nWe\'ve put five people in so far,\nand indeed, we found exactly the same thing. They\'re not lying.\nThe brain areas\nassociated with intense romantic love\nstill become active, 25 years later.'
p3551
aS"\nThere are still many questions to be answered\nand asked about romantic love.\nThe question that I'm working on right this minute --\nand I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end --\nis, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?\nI never would have even thought to think of this,\nbut Match.com, the Internet-dating site,\ncame to me three years ago and asked me that question.\nAnd I said, I don't know.\nI know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love,\nbut I don't know why you fall in love with one person\nrather than another.\nAnd so, I've spent the last three years on this.\nAnd there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person\nrather than another, that psychologists can tell you.\nAnd we tend to fall in love with somebody\nfrom the same socioeconomic background,\nthe same general level of intelligence,\nthe same general level of good looks,\nthe same religious values.\nYour childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.\nAnd that's about it, that's all they know.\nNo, they've never found the way two personalities\nfit together to make a good relationship."
p3552
aS"\nSo, it began to occur to me\nthat maybe your biology pulls you\ntowards some people rather than another.\nAnd I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree\nyou express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.\nI think we've evolved four very broad personality types\nassociated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.\nAnd on this dating site that I have created,\ncalled Chemistry.com, I ask you first a series of questions\nto see to what degree you express these chemicals,\nand I'm watching who chooses who to love.\nAnd 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.\nAbout 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.\nI'm putting the data together now,\nand at some point -- there will always be magic to love,\nbut I think I will come closer to understanding\nwhy it is you can walk into a room\nand everybody is from your background,\nyour same general level of intelligence,\nyour same general level of good looks,\nand you don't feel pulled towards all of them.\nI think there's biology to that.\nI think we're going to end up, in the next few years,\nto understand all kinds of brain mechanisms\nthat pull us to one person rather than another."
p3553
aS'\nSo, I will close with this. These are my older people.\nFaulkner once said, "The past is not dead,\nit\'s not even the past."\nIndeed, we carry a lot of luggage\nfrom our yesteryear in the human brain.\nAnd so, there\'s one thing\nthat makes me pursue my understanding of human nature,\nand this reminds me of it.\nThese are two women.\nWomen tend to get intimacy differently than men do.\nWomen get intimacy from face-to-face talking.\nWe swivel towards each other,\nwe do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.\nThis is intimacy to women.\nI think it comes from millions of years\nof holding that baby in front of your face,\ncajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.\nMen tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.\n(Laughter)\nAs soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.\n(Laughter)\nI think it comes from millions of years\nof standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush,\nlooking straight ahead,\ntrying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.\n(Laughter)\nI think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies,\nthey sat side by side with friends.\nSo my final statement is: love is in us.\nIt\'s deeply embedded in the brain.\nOur challenge is to understand each other. Thank you.\n(Applause)'

aS'\nBionics explores the interplay\nbetween biology and design.\nAs you can see, my legs are bionic.\nToday I will tell human stories\nof bionic integration,\nhow electromechanics attached to the body\nand implanted inside the body\nare beginning to bridge the gap\nbetween disability and ability,\nbetween human limitation\nand human potential.'
p3557
aS"\nBionics has defined my physicality.\nIn 1982, both of my legs were amputated\ndue to tissue damage from frostbite\nincurred during a mountain climbing accident.\nAt that time, I didn't view my body\nas broken.\nI reasoned that a human being\ncan never be broken.\nTechnology is broken.\nTechnology is inadequate.\nThis simple but powerful idea\nwas a call to arms\nto advance technology\nfor the elimination of my own disability\nand ultimately the disability of others.\nI began by developing specialized limbs\nthat allowed me to return\nto the vertical world of rock and ice climbing.\nI quickly realized that the artificial part of my body\nis malleable,\nable to take on any form, any function,\na blank slate through which to create\nperhaps structures that could extend beyond\nbiological capability.\nI made my height adjustable.\nI could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like.\n(Laughter)\nSo when I was feeling badly about myself,\ninsecure, I would jack my height up,\nbut when I was feeling confident and suave,\nI would knock my height down a notch\njust to give the competition a chance.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nNarrow, wedged feet allowed me to climb\nsteep rock fissures\nwhere the human foot cannot penetrate,\nand spiked feet enabled me to climb\nvertical ice walls\nwithout ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue.\nThrough technological innovation,\nI returned to my sport stronger and better.\nTechnology had eliminated my disability\nand allowed me a new climbing prowess.\nAs a young man, I imagined a future world\nwhere technology so advanced\ncould rid the world of disability,\na world in which neural implants would allow\nthe visually impaired to see,\na world in which the paralyzed could walk\nvia body exoskeletons."

p3559
aS"\nToday, I'm going to tell you how my legs function,\nhow they work,\nas a case in point for this center.\nNow, I made sure to shave my legs last night,\nbecause I knew I'd be showing them off."
p3560
aS"\nBionics entails the engineering\nof extreme interfaces.\nThere's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs:\nmechanical, how my limbs are attached\nto my biological body;\ndynamic, how they move like flesh and bone;\nand electrical, how they communicate\nwith my nervous system."
p3561
aS"\nI'll begin with mechanical interface.\nIn the area of design, we still do not understand\nhow to attach devices to the body mechanically.\nIt's extraordinary to me that in this day and age,\none of the most mature, oldest technologies\nin the human timeline, the shoe,\nstill gives us blisters.\nHow can this be?\nWe have no idea how to attach things to our bodies.\nThis is the beautifully lyrical design work\nof Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab,\nshowing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances,\nshown here by color variation\nin this 3D-printed model.\nImagine a future where clothing\nis stiff and soft where you need it,\nwhen you need it, for optimal support and flexibility,\nwithout ever causing discomfort."
p3562
aS"\nMy bionic limbs are attached to my biological body\nvia synthetic skins\nwith stiffness variations\nthat mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics.\nTo achieve that mirroring,\nwe first developed a mathematical model\nof my biological limb.\nTo that end, we used imaging tools such as MRI\nto look inside my body\nto figure out the geometries and locations\nof various tissues.\nWe also took robotic tools.\nHere's a 14-actuator circle\nthat goes around the biological limb.\nThe actuators come in, find the surface of the limb,\nmeasure its unloaded shape,\nand then they push on the tissues\nto measure tissue compliances\nat each anatomical point.\nWe combine these imaging and robotic data\nto build a mathematical description\nof my biological limb, shown on the left.\nYou see a bunch of points, or nodes.\nAt each node, there's a color that\nrepresents tissue compliance.\nWe then do a mathematical transformation\nto the design of the synthetic skin\nshown on the right,\nand we've discovered optimality is\nwhere the body is stiff, the\nsynthetic skin should be soft,\nwhere the body is soft, \nthe synthetic skin is stiff,\nand this mirroring occurs\nacross all tissue compliances.\nWith this framework,\nwe produced bionic limbs\nthat are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn.\nClearly in the future,\nour clothing, our shoes, our braces,\nour prostheses, will no longer be designed\nand manufactured using artisan strategies,\nbut rather data-driven quantitative frameworks.\nIn that future, our shoes\nwill no longer give us blisters."
p3563
aS"\nWe're also embedding sensing and smart materials\ninto the synthetic skins.\nThis is a material\ndeveloped by SRI International, California.\nUnder electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness.\nSo under zero voltage, the material is compliant.\nIt's floppy like paper.\nThen the button's pushed, a voltage is applied,\nand it becomes stiff as a board.\nWe embed this material into the synthetic skin\nthat attaches my bionic limb to my biological body.\nWhen I walk here,\nit's no voltage.\nMy interface is soft and compliant.\nThe button's pushed, voltage is applied,\nand it stiffens,\noffering me a greater maneuverability\nof the bionic limb."
p3564
aS"\nWe're also building exoskeletons.\nThis exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft\nin just the right areas of the running cycle\nto protect the biological joints\nfrom high impacts and degradation.\nIn the future, we'll all be wearing exoskeletons\nin common activities such as running."
p3565
aS"\nNext, dynamic interface.\nHow do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone?\nAt my MIT lab, we study how humans\nwith normal physiologies stand, walk and run.\nWhat are the muscles doing,\nand how are they controlled by the spinal cord?\nThis basic science motivates what we build.\nWe're building bionic ankles, knees and hips.\nWe're building body parts from the ground up.\nThe bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs.\nThey've been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients,\n400 of which have been U.S. wounded soldiers."
p3566
aS"\nHow does it work? At heel\nstrike, under computer control,\nthe system controls stiffness\nto attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground.\nThen at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs\nhigh torques and powers to lift the person\ninto the walking stride,\ncomparable to how muscles work in the calf region.\nThis bionic propulsion is very important\nclinically to patients.\nSo, on the left you see the bionic device\nworn by a lady --\non the right a passive device worn by the same lady\nthat fails to emulate normal muscle function --\nenabling her to do something\neveryone should be able to do,\ngo up and down their steps at home.\nBionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats.\nHere's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway.\nThis is Steve Martin, not the comedian,\nwho lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan."
p3567
aS"\nWe're also building exoskeletal structures\nusing these same principles\nthat wrap around a biological limb.\nThis gentleman does not have\nany leg condition, any disability.\nHe has a normal physiology,\nso these exoskeletons are applying\nmuscle-like torques and powers\nso that his own muscles need not apply\nthose torques and powers.\nThis is the first exoskeleton in history\nthat actually augments human walking.\nIt significantly reduces metabolic cost.\nIt's so profound in its augmentation\nthat when a normal, healthy person\nwears the device for 40 minutes\nand then takes it off,\ntheir own biological legs\nfeel ridiculously heavy and awkward.\nWe're beginning the age in which\nmachines attached to our bodies\nwill make us stronger and faster\nand more efficient."
p3568
aS"\nMoving on to electrical interface,\nhow do my bionic limbs communicate\nwith my nervous system?\nAcross my residual limb are electrodes\nthat measure the electrical pulse of my muscles.\nThat's communicated to the bionic limb,\nso when I think about moving my phantom limb,\nthe robot tracks those movement desires.\nThis diagram shows fundamentally\nhow the bionic limb is controlled,\nso we model the missing biological limb,\nand we've discovered what reflexes occurred,\nhow the reflexes of the spinal cord\nare controlling the muscles,\nand that capability is embedded\nin the chips of the bionic limb.\nWhat we've done, then, is we modulate\nthe sensitivity of the reflex,\nthe modeled spinal reflex,\nwith the neural signal,\nso when I relax my muscles in my residual limb,\nI get very little torque and power,\nbut the more I fire my muscles,\nthe more torque I get,\nand I can even run.\nAnd that was the first demonstration\nof a running gait under neural command.\nFeels great.\n(Applause)"
p3569
aS"\nWe want to go a step further.\nWe want to actually close the loop\nbetween the human and the bionic external limb.\nWe're doing experiments where we're growing\nnerves, transected nerves,\nthrough channels, or micro-channel arrays.\nOn the other side of the channel,\nthe nerve then attaches to cells,\nskin cells and muscle cells.\nIn the motor channels we can sense\nhow the person wishes to move.\nThat can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb,\nthen sensors on the bionic limb\ncan be converted to stimulations\nin adjacent channels, sensory channels.\nSo, when this is fully developed\nand for human use,\npersons like myself will not only have\nsynthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone,\nbut actually feel like flesh and bone."

aS'\nAdrianne breathes and lives dance.\nIt is her expression. It is her art form.\nNaturally, when she lost her limb\nin the Boston terrorist attack,\nshe wanted to return to the dance floor.'
p3580
aS"\nAfter meeting her and driving home in my car,\nI thought, I'm an MIT professor.\nI have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb\nto enable her to go back to her life of dance.\nI brought in MIT scientists with expertise\nin prosthetics, robotics, machine learning\nand biomechanics,\nand over a 200-day research period,\nwe studied dance.\nWe brought in dancers with biological limbs,\nand we studied how do they move,\nwhat forces do they apply on the dance floor,\nand we took those data\nand we put forth fundamental principles of dance,\nreflexive dance capability,\nand we embedded that intelligence\ninto the bionic limb.\nBionics is not only about making people\nstronger and faster.\nOur expression, our humanity\ncan be embedded into electromechanics."
p3581
aS'\nIt was 3.5 seconds\nbetween the bomb blasts\nin the Boston terrorist attack.\nIn 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards\ntook Adrianne off the dance floor.\nIn 200 days, we put her back.\nWe will not be intimidated, brought down,\ndiminished, conquered or stopped\nby acts of violence.\n(Applause)'

S"\nJust a few minutes ago, I took this picture\nabout 10 blocks from here.\nThis is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.\nI took this picture because this turns out to be\nthe first coffeehouse to open\nin England in 1650.\nThat's its great claim to fame,\nand I wanted to show it to you,\nnot because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour\nof historic England,\nbut rather because\nthe English coffeehouse was crucial\nto the development and spread\nof one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,\nwhat we now call the Enlightenment."
p3590
aS"\nAnd the coffeehouse played such a big role\nin the birth of the Enlightenment,\nin part, because of what people were drinking there.\nBecause, before the spread\nof coffee and tea through British culture,\nwhat people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --\nday-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk\nwas alcohol.\nAlcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.\nYou would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,\na little gin -- particularly around 1650 --\nand top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.\nThat was the healthy choice -- right --\nbecause the water wasn't safe to drink.\nAnd so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,\nyou had an entire population\nthat was effectively drunk all day.\nAnd you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life --\nand I know this is true of some of you --\nif you were drinking all day,\nand then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,\nyou would have better ideas.\nYou would be sharper and more alert.\nAnd so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened\nas England switched to tea and coffee."
p3591
aS'\nBut the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important\nis the architecture of the space.\nIt was a space where people would get together\nfrom different backgrounds,\ndifferent fields of expertise, and share.\nIt was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.\nThis was their conjugal bed, in a sense --\nideas would get together there.\nAnd an astonishing number of innovations from this period\nhave a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.'
p3592
aS"\nI've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses\nfor the last five years,\nbecause I've been kind of on this quest\nto investigate this question\nof where good ideas come from.\nWhat are the environments\nthat lead to unusual levels of innovation,\nunusual levels of creativity?\nWhat's the kind of environmental --\nwhat is the space of creativity?\nAnd what I've done is\nI've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;\nI've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,\nthat have been extraordinarily innovative;\nI've gone back to the history of the first cities;\nI've even gone to biological environments,\nlike coral reefs and rainforests,\nthat involve unusual levels of biological innovation;\nand what I've been looking for is shared patterns,\nkind of signature behavior that shows up\nagain and again in all of these environments.\nAre there recurring patterns that we can learn from,\nthat we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,\nor our own organizations,\nor our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?\nAnd I think I've found a few."
p3593
aS'\nBut what you have to do to make sense of this\nand to really understand these principles\nis you have to do away\nwith a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language\nsteers us towards\ncertain concepts of idea-creation.\nWe have this very rich vocabulary\nto describe moments of inspiration.\nWe have the kind of the flash of insight,\nthe stroke of insight,\nwe have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,\nwe have the lightbulb moments, right?\nAll of these concepts,\nas kind of rhetorically florid as they are,\nshare this basic assumption,\nwhich is that an idea is a single thing,\nit\'s something that happens often\nin a wonderful illuminating moment.'
p3594
aS"\nBut in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with\nis this idea that an idea is a network\non the most elemental level.\nI mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.\nAn idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons\nfiring in sync with each other inside your brain.\nIt's a new configuration that has never formed before.\nAnd the question is: how do you get your brain into environments\nwhere these new networks are going to be more likely to form?\nAnd it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world\nmimic a lot of the network patterns\nof the internal world of the human brain."
p3595
aS"\nSo the metaphor I'd like the use\nI can take\nfrom a story of a great idea that's quite recent --\na lot more recent than the 1650s.\nA wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,\nwho has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.\nThey decided to tackle this really pressing problem\nof, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates\nin the developing world.\nOne of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,\nby getting modern neonatal incubators\ninto any context,\nif we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple --\nwe can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.\nSo, the technology is there.\nThese are standard in all the industrialized worlds.\nThe problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,\nand you send it off\nto a mid-sized village in Africa,\nit will work great for a year or two years,\nand then something will go wrong and it will break,\nand it will remain broken forever,\nbecause you don't have a whole system of spare parts,\nand you don't have the on-the-ground expertise\nto fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.\nAnd so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money\ngetting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,\nand then it ends up being useless."
p3596
aS'\nSo what Prestero and his team decided to do\nis to look around and see: what are the abundant resources\nin these developing world contexts?\nAnd what they noticed was they don\'t have a lot of DVRs,\nthey don\'t have a lot of microwaves,\nbut they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.\nThere\'s a Toyota Forerunner\non the street in all these places.\nThey seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.\nSo they started to think,\n"Could we build a neonatal incubator\nthat\'s built entirely out of automobile parts?"\nAnd this is what they ended up coming with.\nIt\'s called a "neonurture device."\nFrom the outside, it looks like a normal little thing\nyou\'d find in a modern, Western hospital.\nIn the inside, it\'s all car parts.\nIt\'s got a fan, it\'s got headlights for warmth,\nit\'s got door chimes for alarm --\nit runs off a car battery.\nAnd so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota\nand the ability to fix a headlight,\nand you can repair this thing.\nNow, that\'s a great idea, but what I\'d like to say is that, in fact,\nthis is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.\nWe like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,\nare like that $40,000, brand new incubator,\nstate-of-the-art technology,\nbut more often than not, they\'re cobbled together\nfrom whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.'
p3597
aS"\nWe take ideas from other people,\nfrom people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,\nand we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.\nThat's really where innovation happens.\nAnd that means that we have to change some of our models\nof what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.\nI mean, this is one vision of it.\nAnother is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.\nThis is a statue from Oxford.\nYou know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,\nand the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.\nIn fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation\ntend to look like this, right.\nThis is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,\nbut this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.\nThis is the kind of chaotic environment\nwhere ideas were likely to come together,\nwhere people were likely to have\nnew, interesting, unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds.\nSo, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,\nwe have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this.\nThis is what your office should look like,\nis part of my message here."
p3598
aS'\nAnd one of the problems with this is that\npeople are actually -- when you research this field --\npeople are notoriously unreliable,\nwhen they actually kind of self-report\non where they have their own good ideas,\nor their history of their best ideas.\nAnd a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar\ndecided to go around\nand basically do the Big Brother approach\nto figuring out where good ideas come from.\nHe went to a bunch of science labs around the world\nand videotaped everyone\nas they were doing every little bit of their job.\nSo when they were sitting in front of the microscope,\nwhen they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.\nAnd he recorded all of these conversations\nand tried to figure out where the most important ideas,\nwhere they happened.\nAnd when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,\nwe have this image -- you know, they\'re pouring over the microscope,\nand they see something in the tissue sample.\nAnd "oh, eureka," they\'ve got the idea.'
p3599
aS'\nWhat happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape\nis that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas\ndid not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.\nThey happened at the conference table\nat the weekly lab meeting,\nwhen everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,\noftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,\nthe error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.\nAnd something about that environment --\nand I\'ve started calling it the "liquid network,"\nwhere you have lots of different ideas that are together,\ndifferent backgrounds, different interests,\njostling with each other, bouncing off each other --\nthat environment is, in fact,\nthe environment that leads to innovation.'
p3600
aS'\nThe other problem that people have\nis they like to condense their stories of innovation down\nto kind of shorter time frames.\nSo they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.\nThey want to say, "There I was, I was standing there\nand I had it all suddenly clear in my head."\nBut in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,\nit turns out that a lot of important ideas\nhave very long incubation periods --\nI call this the "slow hunch."\nWe\'ve heard a lot recently\nabout hunch and instinct\nand blink-like sudden moments of clarity,\nbut in fact, a lot of great ideas\nlinger on, sometimes for decades,\nin the back of people\'s minds.\nThey have a feeling that there\'s an interesting problem,\nbut they don\'t quite have the tools yet to discover them.\nThey spend all this time working on certain problems,\nbut there\'s another thing lingering there\nthat they\'re interested in, but they can\'t quite solve.'
p3601
aS'\nDarwin is a great example of this.\nDarwin himself, in his autobiography,\ntells the story of coming up with the idea\nfor natural selection\nas a classic "eureka!" moment.\nHe\'s in his study,\nit\'s October of 1838,\nand he\'s reading Malthus, actually, on population.\nAnd all of a sudden,\nthe basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head\nand he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."\nThat\'s in his autobiography.\nAbout a decade or two ago,\na wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back\nand looked at Darwin\'s notebooks from this period.\nAnd Darwin kept these copious notebooks\nwhere he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.\nAnd what Gruber found was\nthat Darwin had the full theory of natural selection\nfor months and months and months\nbefore he had his alleged epiphany,\nreading Malthus in October of 1838.\nThere are passages where you can read it,\nand you think you\'re reading from a Darwin textbook,\nfrom the period before he has this epiphany.\nAnd so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,\nhad the idea, he had the concept,\nbut was unable of fully thinking it yet.\nAnd that is actually how great ideas often happen;\nthey fade into view over long periods of time.'
p3602
aS'\nNow the challenge for all of us is:\nhow do you create environments\nthat allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?\nIt\'s hard to go to your boss and say,\n"I have an excellent idea for our organization.\nIt will be useful in 2020.\nCould you just give me some time to do that?"\nNow a couple of companies -- like Google --\nthey have innovation time off, 20 percent time,\nwhere, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.\nBut that\'s a key thing.\nAnd the other thing is to allow those hunches\nto connect with other people\'s hunches; that\'s what often happens.\nYou have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,\nand if you\'re in the right environment,\nthey turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.\nSo, in a sense,\nwe often talk about the value\nof protecting intellectual property,\nyou know, building barricades,\nhaving secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have,\nso that those ideas will remain valuable,\nand people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,\nand the culture will be more innovative.\nBut I think there\'s a case to be made\nthat we should spend at least as much time, if not more,\nvaluing the premise of connecting ideas\nand not just protecting them.'
p3603
aS'\nAnd I\'ll leave you with this story,\nwhich I think captures a lot of these values,\nand it\'s just wonderful kind of tale of innovation\nand how it happens in unlikely ways.\nIt\'s October of 1957,\nand Sputnik has just launched,\nand we\'re in Laurel Maryland,\nat the applied physics lab\nassociated with Johns Hopkins University.\nAnd it\'s Monday morning,\nand the news has just broken about this satellite\nthat\'s now orbiting the planet.\nAnd of course, this is nerd heaven, right?\nThere are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,\n"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can\'t believe this has happened."\nAnd two of them,\ntwo 20-something researchers at the APL\nare there at the cafeteria table\nhaving an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.\nAnd these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.\nAnd they start talking, and one of them says,\n"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?\nThere\'s this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space\nthat\'s obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.\nWe could probably hear it, if we tune in."\nAnd so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,\nand everybody\'s like, "No, I hadn\'t thought of doing that.\nThat\'s an interesting idea."'
p3604
aS"\nAnd it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert\nin microwave reception,\nand he's got a little antennae set up\nwith an amplifier in his office.\nAnd so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,\nand they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.\nAnd after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,\nbecause the Soviets made Sputnik\nvery easy to track.\nIt was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,\nbecause they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.\nSo they made it really easy to find it."
p3605
aS'\nSo these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,\nand people start kind of coming into the office and saying,\n"Wow, that\'s pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that\'s great."\nAnd before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.\nWe may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.\nWe should record it."\nAnd so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder\nand they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.\nAnd they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps\nfor each little bleep that they record.\nAnd they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we\'re noticing\nsmall little frequency variations here.\nWe could probably calculate the speed\nthat the satellite is traveling,\nif we do a little basic math here\nusing the Doppler effect."\nAnd then they played around with it a little bit more,\nand they talked to a couple of their colleagues\nwho had other kind of specialties.\nAnd they said, "Jeez, you know,\nwe think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect\nto figure out the points at which\nthe satellite is closest to our antennae\nand the points at which it\'s farthest away.\nThat\'s pretty cool."'
p3606
aS"\nAnd eventually, they get permission --\nthis is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.\nThey get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer\nthat takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.\nThey run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,\nturns out they have mapped the exact trajectory\nof this satellite around the Earth,\njust from listening to this one little signal,\ngoing off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do\nover lunch one morning."
p3607
aS'\nA couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,\npulls them into the room and says,\n"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something\nabout that project you were working on.\nYou\'ve figured out an unknown location\nof a satellite orbiting the planet\nfrom a known location on the ground.\nCould you go the other way?\nCould you figure out an unknown location on the ground,\nif you knew the location of the satellite?"\nAnd they thought about it and they said,\n"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let\'s run the numbers here."\nSo they went back, and they thought about it.\nAnd they came back and said, "Actually, it\'ll be easier."\nAnd he said, "Oh, that\'s great.\nBecause see, I have these new nuclear submarines\nthat I\'m building.\nAnd it\'s really hard to figure out how to get your missile\nso that it will land right on top of Moscow,\nif you don\'t know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nSo we\'re thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites\nand use it to track our submarines\nand figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.\nCould you work on that problem?"'
p3608
aS"\nAnd that's how GPS was born.\n30 years later,\nRonald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform\nthat anybody could kind of build upon\nand anybody could come along and build new technology\nthat would create and innovate\non top of this open platform,\nleft it open for anyone to do\npretty much anything they wanted with it.\nAnd now, I guarantee you\ncertainly half of this room, if not more,\nhas a device sitting in their pocket right now\nthat is talking to one of these satellites in outer space.\nAnd I bet you one of you, if not more,\nhas used said device and said satellite system\nto locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --\n(Laughter)\nin the last day or last week, right?"
p3609
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3610
aS"\nAnd that, I think,\nis a great case study, a great lesson\nin the power, the marvelous, kind of unplanned\nemergent, unpredictable power\nof open innovative systems.\nWhen you build them right, they will be led to completely new directions\nthat the creators never even dreamed of.\nI mean, here you have these guys\nwho basically thought they were just following this hunch,\nthis little passion that had developed,\nthen they thought they were fighting the Cold War,\nand then it turns out they're just helping somebody\nfind a soy latte."
p3611

p3612

S'\nThe Kraken, a beast so terrifying\nit was said to devour men and ships and whales,\nand so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.\nIn assessing the merits of such tales,\nit\'s probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor\'s saw\nthat the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story\nis a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"\nand a sea story begins, "This ain\'t no shit." (Laughter)'
p3617
aS'\nEvery fish that gets away\ngrows with every telling of the tale.\nNevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,\nand we now have video proof,\nas those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.'
p3618
aS"\nI was one of the three scientists on this expedition\nthat took place last summer off Japan.\nI'm the short one.\nThe other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea."
p3619
aS"\nI owe my participation in this now-historic event\nto TED.\nIn 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue\nheld aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos\nas part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.\nI spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,\none that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.\nMike deGruy was also invited,\nand he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,\nand he also talked to me about applying my approach\nto something he's been involved with for a very long time,\nwhich is the hunt for the giant squid.\nIt was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,\na gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel\nthat summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)"
p3620
aS'\nI gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing\nand optical luring of deep sea squid\nin which I emphasized the importance\nof using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.\nThis came out of hundreds of dives I have made,\nfarting around in the dark\nusing these platforms,\nand my impression that I saw more animals\nworking from the submersible\nthan I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.\nBut that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.\nBut I also felt like I saw more animals\nworking with the Tiburon than the Ventana,\ntwo vehicles with the same field of view\nbut different propulsion systems.'
p3621
aS"\nSo my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.\nSo I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,\nand I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance\nand recorded the sound they made.\nThe Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --\nwhich you can probably just barely hear here,\nuses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.\nThe Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.\nIt's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)\nBut most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics\nand they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)\nI think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away."
p3622
aS"\nSo for the deep sea squid hunt,\nI proposed using an optical lure\nattached to a camera platform\nwith no thrusters, no motors,\njust a battery-powered camera,\nand the only illumination coming from red light\nthat's invisible to most deep-sea animals\nthat are adapted to see primarily blue.\nThat's visible to our eye,\nbut it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.\nSo this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,\ncould just be thrown off the back of the ship,\nattached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,\nit would just float around passively carried by the currents,\nand the only light visible to the animals in the deep\nwould be the blue light of the optical lure,\nwhich we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,\nbecause it was designed to imitate\nthe bioluminescent display\nof the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla."
p3623
aS"\nNow, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces\nis known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm\nand is a form of defense.\nThe reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure\nis not because giant squid eat jellyfish,\nbut it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light\nwhen it's being chewed on by a predator\nand its only hope for escape\nmay be to attract the attention of a larger predator\nthat will attack its attacker\nand thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.\nIt's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,\nand a common form of defense in the deep sea."
p3624
aS'\nThe approach worked.\nWhereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner\na single video glimpse of the giant,\nwe managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.'
p3625
aS"\nEdith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there."
p3626
aS"\nEW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --\nnow you see me, now you don't --\nand we had four such teasing appearances,\nand then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us."

p3630
aS'\nEW: The full monty.'
p3631
aS'\nWhat really wowed me about that\nwas the way it came in up over the e-jelly\nand then attacked the enormous thing next to it,\nwhich I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.'
p3632
aS'\nBut even more incredible was the footage shot\nfrom the Triton submersible.\nWhat was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary\nwas that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,\na one-meter long diamondback squid\nhad a light attached to it, a squid jig\nof the type that longline fishermen use,\nand I think it was this light\nthat brought the giant in.'
p3633
aS"\nNow, what you're seeing\nis the intensified camera's view under red light,\nand that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.\nAnd then he got so excited,\nhe turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,\nand the giant didn't run away,\nso he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,\nbringing a creature of legend\nfrom the misty history into high-resolution video.\nIt was absolutely breathtaking,\nand had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact\nand fully extended,\nit would have been as tall as a two-story house."
p3634
aS"\nHow could something that big\nlive in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?\nWe've only explored about five percent of our ocean.\nThere are great discoveries yet to be made down there,\nfantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution\nand possibly bioactive compounds\nthat could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.\nYet we have spent only a tiny fraction\nof the money on ocean exploration\nthat we've spent on space exploration.\nWe need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,\nbecause we need to be exploring and protecting\nour life support systems here on Earth."
p3635
aS'\nWe need  thank you. (Applause)'
p3636
aS'\nExploration is the engine that drives innovation.\nInnovation drives economic growth.\nSo let\'s all go exploring,\nbut let\'s do it in a way that doesn\'t scare the animals away,\nor, as Mike deGruy once said,\n"If you want to get away from it all\nand see something you\'ve never seen,\nor have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one\'s ever seen,\nget in a sub."\nHe should have been with us for this adventure.\nWe miss him.\n(Applause)'
p3637
aa(lp3638
S'\nI was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,\nages six to eight, at a children\'s museum,\nand I brought with me a bag full of legs,\nsimilar to the kinds of things you see up here,\nand had them laid out on a table for the kids.\nAnd, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious\nabout what they don\'t know, or don\'t understand,\nor is foreign to them.\nThey only learn to be frightened of those differences\nwhen an adult influences them to behave that way,\nand maybe censors that natural curiosity,\nor you know, reins in the question-asking\nin the hopes of them being polite little kids.\nSo I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby\nwith these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,\ndon\'t stare at her legs."'
p3639
aS'\nBut, of course, that\'s the point.\nThat\'s why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.\nSo I made a deal with the adults\nthat the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes\non their own.\nThe doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,\nand they are poking and prodding, and they\'re wiggling toes,\nand they\'re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg\nto see what happens with that.\nAnd I said, "Kids, really quickly --\nI woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --\nnothing too big, two or three stories --\nbut, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,\nanything you can dream up right now,\nwhat kind of legs would you build me?"'

aS'\nAnd immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"\n"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"\n"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"\n"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."\nAnd other things that I don\'t -- aren\'t familiar with.\nAnd then, one eight-year-old said,\n"Hey, why wouldn\'t you want to fly too?"\nAnd the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."\n(Laughter)\nAnd just like that, I went from being a woman\nthat these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"\nto somebody that had potential that their bodies didn\'t have yet.\nSomebody that might even be super-abled.\nInteresting.'
p3641
aS"\nSo some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.\nAnd there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is\nfor both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.\nTED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.\nAt the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.\nI had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs\nmodeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,\nwhich you may have seen on stage yesterday.\nAnd also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs."
p3642
aS'\nSo at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out\nto innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community\nto come bring their talent to the science and to the art\nof building legs.\nSo that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,\nand assigning them different values.\nWell, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.\nAnd the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --\nChee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.\nShe was the editor then of a magazine called ID,\nand she gave me a cover story.'
p3643
aS'\nThis started an incredible journey.\nCurious encounters were happening to me at the time;\nI\'d been accepting numerous invitations to speak\non the design of the cheetah legs around the world.\nAnd people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,\nmen and women.\nAnd the conversation would go something like this,\n"You know Aimee, you\'re very attractive.\nYou don\'t look disabled."\n(Laughter)\nI thought, "Well, that\'s amazing,\nbecause I don\'t feel disabled."\nAnd it really opened my eyes to this conversation\nthat could be explored, about beauty.\nWhat does a beautiful woman have to look like?\nWhat is a sexy body?\nAnd interestingly, from an identity standpoint,\nwhat does it mean to have a disability?\nI mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.\nNobody calls her disabled.\n(Laughter)'
p3644
aS'\nSo this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,\nwent to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,\nwho were also interested in exploring that conversation.\nSo, three months after TED I found myself on a plane\nto London, doing my first fashion shoot,\nwhich resulted in this cover --\n"Fashion-able"?\nThree months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen\non a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.\nNobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.\nActually, I have them on stage with me:\ngrapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.\nPoetry matters.\nPoetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object\nto a realm of art.\nIt can transform the thing that might have made people fearful\ninto something that invites them to look,\nand look a little longer,\nand maybe even understand.'
p3645
aS'\nI learned this firsthand with my next adventure.\nThe artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."\nThis is where it really hit home for me --\nthat my legs could be wearable sculpture.\nAnd even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness\nas the only aesthetic ideal.\nSo we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs\neven though they\'re actually optically clear polyurethane,\na.k.a. bowling ball material.\nHeavy!\nThen we made these legs that are cast in soil\nwith a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,\nand a very lovely brass toe.\nThat\'s a good close-up of that one.\nThen another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --\na little homage to my life as an athlete.\n14 hours of prosthetic make-up\nto get into a creature that had articulated paws,\nclaws and a tail that whipped around,\nlike a gecko.\n(Laughter)\nAnd then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --\nlook like jellyfish legs,\nalso polyurethane.\nAnd the only purpose that these legs can serve,\noutside the context of the film,\nis to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.\nSo whimsy matters.'
p3646
aS'\nToday, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs\nthat various people have made for me,\nand with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,\nand I can change my height --\nI have a variable of five different heights.\n(Laughter)\nToday, I\'m 6\'1".\nAnd I had these legs made a little over a year ago\nat Dorset Orthopedic in England\nand when I brought them home to Manhattan,\nmy first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.\nAnd a girl was there who has known me for years\nat my normal 5\'8".\nHer mouth dropped open when she saw me,\nand she went, "But you\'re so tall!"\nAnd I said, "I know. Isn\'t it fun?"\nI mean, it\'s a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,\nbut I have an entirely new relationship to door jams\nthat I never expected I would ever have.\nAnd I was having fun with it.\nAnd she looked at me,\nand she said, "But, Aimee, that\'s not fair."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nAnd the incredible thing was she really meant it.\nIt\'s not fair that you can change your height,\nas you want it.'
p3647
aS'\nAnd that\'s when I knew --\nthat\'s when I knew that the conversation with society\nhas changed profoundly\nin this last decade.\nIt is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.\nIt\'s a conversation about augmentation.\nIt\'s a conversation about potential.\nA prosthetic limb doesn\'t represent the need to replace loss anymore.\nIt can stand as a symbol that the wearer\nhas the power to create whatever it is that they want to create\nin that space.\nSo people that society once considered to be disabled\ncan now become the architects of their own identities\nand indeed continue to change those identities\nby designing their bodies\nfrom a place of empowerment.\nAnd what is exciting to me so much right now\nis that by combining cutting-edge technology --\nrobotics, bionics --\nwith the age-old poetry,\nwe are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.\nI think that if we want to discover the full potential\nin our humanity,\nwe need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths\nand those glorious disabilities that we all have.\nI think of Shakespeare\'s Shylock:\n"If you prick us, do we not bleed,\nand if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"\nIt is our humanity,\nand all the potential within it,\nthat makes us beautiful.\nThank you.\n(Applause)'

aa(lp3649
S"\nI wanted to talk to you today\nabout creative confidence.\nI'm going to start way back in the third grade\nat Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio."
p3650
aS'\nI remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.\nHe was making a horse out of the clay\nthat our teacher kept under the sink.\nAnd at one point, one of the girls who was sitting at his table,\nseeing what he was doing,\nleaned over and said to him,\n"That\'s terrible. That doesn\'t look anything like a horse."\nAnd Brian\'s shoulders sank.\nAnd he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.\nI never saw Brian do a project like that ever again.'
p3651
aS'\nAnd I wonder how often that happens.\nIt seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class,\na lot of them want to come up after class\nand tell me about their similar experience,\nhow a teacher shut them down\nor how a student was particularly cruel to them.\nAnd some opt out thinking of themselves\nas creative at that point.\nAnd I see that opting out that happens in childhood,\nand it moves in and becomes more ingrained,\neven by the time you get to adult life.'
p3652
aS'\nSo we see a lot of this.\nWhen we have a workshop\nor when we have clients in to work with us side-by-side,\neventually we get to the point in the process\nthat\'s fuzzy or unconventional.\nAnd eventually these bigshot executives whip out their Blackberries\nand they say they have to make really important phone calls,\nand they head for the exits.\nAnd they\'re just so uncomfortable.\nWhen we track them down and ask them what\'s going on,\nthey say something like, "I\'m just not the creative type."\nBut we know that\'s not true.\nIf they stick with the process, if they stick with it,\nthey end up doing amazing things\nand they surprise themselves just how innovative\nthey and their teams really are.'
p3653
aS"\nSo I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have.\nThat you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged.\nIf you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged.\nAnd I had a major breakthrough\nwhen I met the psychologist Albert Bandura."
p3654
aS"\nI don't know if you know Albert Bandura.\nBut if you go to Wikipedia,\nit says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history --\nlike Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura.\nBandura's 86 and he still works at Stanford.\nAnd he's just a lovely guy."
p3655
aS"\nAnd so I went to see him\nbecause he has just worked on phobias for a long time,\nwhich I'm very interested in.\nHe had developed this way, this kind of methodology,\nthat ended up curing people in a very short amount of time.\nIn four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.\nAnd we talked about snakes. I don't know why we talked about snakes.\nWe talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia."
p3656
aS'\nAnd it was really enjoyable, really interesting.\nHe told me that he\'d invite the test subject in,\nand he\'d say, "You know, there\'s a snake in the next room\nand we\'re going to go in there."\nTo which, he reported, most of them replied,\n"Hell no, I\'m not going in there,\ncertainly if there\'s a snake in there."'
p3657
aS'\nBut Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful.\nSo he\'d take people to this two-way mirror\nlooking into the room where the snake was,\nand he\'d get them comfortable with that.\nAnd then through a series of steps,\nhe\'d move them and they\'d be standing in the doorway with the door open\nand they\'d be looking in there.\nAnd he\'d get them comfortable with that.\nAnd then many more steps later, baby steps,\nthey\'d be in the room, they\'d have a leather glove like a welder\'s glove on,\nand they\'d eventually touch the snake.\nAnd when they touched the snake everything was fine. They were cured.\nIn fact, everything was better than fine.\nThese people who had life-long fears of snakes\nwere saying things like,\n"Look how beautiful that snake is."\nAnd they were holding it in their laps.'
p3658
aS'\nBandura calls this process "guided mastery."\nI love that term: guided mastery.\nAnd something else happened,\nthese people who went through the process and touched the snake\nended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives.\nThey tried harder, they persevered longer,\nand they were more resilient in the face of failure.\nThey just gained a new confidence.\nAnd Bandura calls that confidence self-efficacy --\nthe sense that you can change the world\nand that you can attain what you set out to do.'
p3659
aS"\nWell meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me\nbecause I realized that this famous scientist\nhad documented and scientifically validated\nsomething that we've seen happen for the last 30 years.\nThat we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative,\nand we could take them through a series of steps,\nkind of like a series of small successes,\nand they turn fear into familiarity, and they surprise themselves.\nThat transformation is amazing."
p3660
aS"\nWe see it at the d.school all the time.\nPeople from all different kinds of disciplines,\nthey think of themselves as only analytical.\nAnd they come in and they go through the process, our process,\nthey build confidence and now they think of themselves differently.\nAnd they're totally emotionally excited\nabout the fact that they walk around\nthinking of themselves as a creative person."
p3661
aS"\nSo I thought one of the things I'd do today\nis take you through and show you what this journey looks like.\nTo me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.\nDoug Dietz is a technical person.\nHe designs medical imaging equipment,\nlarge medical imaging equipment.\nHe's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career.\nBut at one point he had a moment of crisis."
p3662
aS'\nHe was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use\nwhen he saw a young family.\nThere was a little girl,\nand that little girl was crying and was terrified.\nAnd Doug was really disappointed to learn\nthat nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital\nhad to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.\nAnd this was really disappointing to Doug,\nbecause before this time he was proud of what he did.\nHe was saving lives with this machine.\nBut it really hurt him to see the fear\nthat this machine caused in kids.'
p3663
aS'\nAbout that time he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes.\nHe was learning about our process\nabout design thinking, about empathy,\nabout iterative prototyping.\nAnd he would take this new knowledge\nand do something quite extraordinary.\nHe would redesign the entire experience of being scanned.\nAnd this is what he came up with.'
p3664
aS'\nHe turned it into an adventure for the kids.\nHe painted the walls and he painted the machine,\nand he got the operators retrained by people who know kids,\nlike children\'s museum people.\nAnd now when the kid comes, it\'s an experience.\nAnd they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship.\nAnd when they come, they say,\n"Okay, you\'re going to go into the pirate ship,\nbut be very still because we don\'t want the pirates to find you."'
p3665
aS'\nAnd the results were super dramatic.\nSo from something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated,\nto something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated.\nAnd the hospital and GE were happy too.\nBecause you didn\'t have to call the anesthesiologist all the time,\nthey could put more kids through the machine in a day.\nSo the quantitative results were great.\nBut Doug\'s results that he cared about were much more qualitative.\nHe was with one of the mothers\nwaiting for her child to come out of the scan.\nAnd when the little girl came out of her scan,\nshe ran up to her mother and said,\n"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"\n(Laughter)'
p3666
aS"\nAnd so I've heard Doug tell the story many times,\nof his personal transformation\nand the breakthrough design that happened from it,\nbut I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl\nwithout a tear in his eye."
p3667
aS"\nDoug's story takes place in a hospital.\nI know a thing or two about hospitals.\nA few years ago I felt a lump on the side of my neck,\nand it was my turn in the MRI machine.\nIt was cancer. It was the bad kind.\nI was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival."
p3668
aS"\nSo while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas\nand everybody's pale and thin\nand you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays,\nyou think of a lot of things.\nMostly you think about, Am I going to survive?\nAnd I thought a lot about,\nWhat was my daughter's life going to be like without me?\nBut you think about other things.\nI thought a lot about, What was I put on Earth to do?\nWhat was my calling? What should I do?\nAnd I was lucky because I had lots of options.\nWe'd been working in health and wellness,\nand K through 12, and the Developing World.\nAnd so there were lots of projects that I could work on.\nBut I decided and I committed to at this point\nto the thing I most wanted to do --\nwas to help as many people as possible\nregain the creative confidence they lost along their way.\nAnd if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do.\nI survived, just so you know."
p3669
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3670
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3671
aS"\nI really believe\nthat when people gain this confidence --\nand we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO --\nthey actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives.\nWe see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions.\nWe see them come up with more interesting, and just more, ideas\nso they can choose from better ideas.\nAnd they just make better decisions."
p3672
aS"\nSo I know at TED you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing.\nEverybody has a change-the-world thing.\nIf there is one for me, this is it. To help this happen.\nSo I hope you'll join me on my quest --\nyou as thought leaders.\nIt would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world\ninto the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing,\nand to have people realize that they're naturally creative.\nAnd those natural people should let their ideas fly.\nThat they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy,\nthat you can do what you set out to do,\nand that you can reach a place of creative confidence\nand touch the snake."
p3673
aS'\nThank you.'
p3674
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3675
aa(lp3676
S'\nYou know, my favorite part of being a dad\nis the movies I get to watch.\nI love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,\nand when my daughter was four,\nwe got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.\nIt totally dominated her imagination for months.\nHer favorite character was Glinda, of course.\nIt gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress\nand carry a wand.'
p3677
aS'\nBut you watch that movie enough times,\nand you start to realize how unusual it is.\nNow we live today, and are raising our children,\nin a kind of children\'s-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.\nBut "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.\nIt did not start that trend.\nForty years later was when the trend really caught on,\nwith, interestingly, another movie\nthat featured a metal guy\nand a furry guy\nrescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy\'s guards.\nDo you know what I\'m talking about? (Laughter)\nYeah.'
p3678
aS'\nNow, there\'s a big difference between these two movies,\na couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"\nand all the movies we watch today.\nOne is there\'s very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."\nThe monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.\nBut I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,\nthe wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz\nthat the prophecy foretold.\nUse your magic slippers to defeat\nthe computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."\nBut that\'s not how it happens.'
p3679
aS'\nAnother thing that\'s really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"\nto me is that all of the most heroic\nand wise and even villainous characters\nare female.'
p3680
aS'\nNow I started to notice this\nwhen I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,\nwhich was years later, and the situation was different.\nAt that point I also had a son.\nHe was only three at the time.\nHe was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.\nBut he was the second child,\nand the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)\nSo he wandered in,\nand it imprinted on him\nlike a mommy duck does to its duckling,\nand I don\'t think he understands what\'s going on,\nbut he is sure soaking in it.'
p3681
aS"\nAnd I wonder what he's soaking in.\nIs he picking up on the themes of courage\nand perseverance and loyalty?\nIs he picking up on the fact that Luke\njoins an army to overthrow the government?\nIs he picking up on the fact that\nthere are only boys in the universe\nexcept for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,\nwho's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie\nso that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink\nto thank him for saving the universe, which he does\nby the magic that he was born with?"
p3682
aS'\nCompare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."\nHow does Dorothy win her movie?\nBy making friends with everybody\nand being a leader.\nThat\'s kind of the world I\'d rather raise my kids in --\nOz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,\nwhich is where we kind of have to be.\nWhy is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --\nin the movies we have for our kids,\nand so little yellow brick road?'
p3683
aS"\nThere is a lot of great writing about the impact\nthat the boy-violent movie has on girls,\nand you should do that reading. It's very good.\nI haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.\nI know from my own experience that\nPrincess Leia did not provide the adequate context\nthat I could have used in navigating the adult world\nthat is co-ed. (Laughter)\nI think there was a first-kiss moment\nwhen I really expected the credits to start rolling\nbecause that's the end of the movie, right?\nI finished my quest, I got the girl.\nWhy are you still standing there?\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do."
p3684
aS'\nThe movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain\nand getting your reward, and there\'s not a lot of room\nfor other relationships and other journeys.\nIt\'s almost as though if you\'re a boy,\nyou are a dopey animal,\nand if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.\nThere are plenty of exceptions,\nand I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.\nBut they do send a message to boys,\nthat they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.\nThey are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls\nhow to defend against the patriarchy,\nbut they are not necessarily showing boys\nhow they\'re supposed to defend against the patriarchy.\nThere\'s no models for them.\nAnd we also have some terrific women\nwho are writing new stories for our kids,\nand as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,\nthese are still war movies.\nAnd, of course, the most successful studio of all time\ncontinues to crank out classic after classic,\nevery single one of them about\nthe journey of a boy, or a man,\nor two men who are friends, or a man and his son,\nor two men who are raising a little girl.\nUntil, as many of you are thinking, this year,\nwhen they finally came out with "Brave."\nI recommend it to all of you. It\'s on demand now.\nDo you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?\n"Aw, I can\'t believe Pixar made a princess movie."\nIt\'s very good. Don\'t let that stop you.'
p3685
aS"\nNow, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.\nI don't know if you've heard of this.\nIt has not yet caught on and caught fire,\nbut maybe today we will start a movement.\nAlison Bechdel is a comic book artist,\nand back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation\nshe'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.\nAnd it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:"
p3686
aS'\nIs there more than one character in the movie\nthat is female who has lines?\nSo try to meet that bar.'
p3687
aS'\nAnd do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?'
p3688
aS'\nAnd is their conversation about something other than\nthe guy that they both like? (Laughter)'
p3689
aS'\nRight? Thank you. (Applause)\nThank you very much.'
p3690
aS"\nTwo women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.\nIt does happen. I've seen it,\nand yet I very rarely see it in the movies\nthat we know and love."
p3691
aS'\nIn fact, this week I went to see\na very high-quality movie, "Argo."\nRight? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,\na consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.\nIt pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.\nAnd I don\'t think it should, because a lot of the movie,\nI don\'t know if you\'ve seen it, but a lot of the movie\ntakes place in this embassy where men and women\nare hiding out during the hostage crisis.\nWe\'ve got quite a few scenes of the men\nhaving deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,\nand the great moment for one of the actresses is\nto peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"\nThat\'s Hollywood for you.'
p3692
aS"\nSo let's look at the numbers.\n2011, of the 100 most popular movies,\nhow many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?\nEleven. It's not bad.\nIt's not as many percent as the number of women\nwe've just elected to Congress, so that's good.\nBut there is a number that is greater than this\nthat's going to bring this room down."
p3693
aS"\nLast year, The New York Times published a study\nthat the government had done.\nHere's what it said.\nOne out of five women in America\nsay that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life."
p3694
aS"\nNow, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.\nI don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.\nI don't even think that\nmusic videos or pornography are really directly related to that,\nbut something is going wrong,\nand when I hear that statistic,\none of the things I think of is\nthat's a lot of sexual assailants.\nWho are these guys? What are they learning?\nWhat are they failing to learn?\nAre they absorbing the story that\na male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence\nand then collect the reward, which is a woman\nwho has no friends and doesn't speak?\nAre we soaking up that story?"
p3695
aS'\nYou know,\nas a parent with the privilege\nof raising a daughter\nlike all of you who are doing the same thing,\nwe find this world and this statistic very alarming\nand we want to prepare them.\nWe have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"\nand we hope that that will help,\nbut I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them\nif, at the same time, actively or passively,\nwe are training our sons to maintain their boy power?\nI mean, I think the Netflix queue\nis one way that we can do something very important,\nand I\'m talking mainly to the dads here.\nI think we have got to show our sons\na new definition of manhood.'
p3696
aS'\nThe definition of manhood is already turning upside down.\nYou\'ve read about how the new economy\nis changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.\nThey\'re throwing it up in the air.\nSo our sons are going to have to find some way\nof adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,\nand I think we really have to show them, and model for them,\nhow a real man\nis someone who trusts his sisters\nand respects them, and wants to be on their team,\nand stands up against the real bad guys,\nwho are the men who want to abuse the women.\nAnd I think our job in the Netflix queue\nis to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,\nif we can find them, and to seek out the heroines\nwho are there,\nwho show real courage, who bring people together,\nand to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines\nand to say, "I want to be on their team,"\nbecause they\'re going to be on their team.'
p3697
aS'\nWhen I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"\ndo you know what she said?\nObi-Wan.\nObi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.\nWhat do these two have in common?\nMaybe it\'s not just the sparkly dress.\nI think these people are experts.\nI think these are the two people in the movie\nwho know more than anybody else,\nand they love sharing their knowledge with other people\nto help them reach their potential.\nNow, they are leaders.\nI like that kind of quest for my daughter,\nand I like that kind of quest for my son.\nI want more quests like that.\nI want fewer quests where my son is told,\n"Go out and fight it alone,"\nand more quests where he sees that it\'s his job to join a team,\nmaybe a team led by women,\nto help other people become better\nand be better people,\nlike the Wizard of Oz.\nThank you.'

aS"\nThis is a room of type-A women.\nThis is a room\nof sleep-deprived women.\nAnd I learned the hard way,\nthe value of sleep.\nTwo-and-a-half years ago,\nI fainted from exhaustion.\nI hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone,\nI got five stitches on my right eye.\nAnd I began the journey\nof rediscovering the value of sleep.\nAnd in the course of that,\nI studied,\nI met with medical doctors, scientists,\nand I'm here to tell you\nthat the way to a more productive,\nmore inspired, more joyful life\nis getting enough sleep."

p3707
aS'\nBecause unfortunately\nfor men,\nsleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.\nI was recently having dinner with a guy\nwho bragged that he had only gotten\nfour hours sleep the night before.\nAnd I felt like saying to him -- but I didn\'t say it --\nI felt like saying, "You know what?\nIf you had gotten five,\nthis dinner would have been a lot more interesting."'
p3708
aS'\n(Laughter)'

aS'\nThere is now a kind of sleep deprivation\none-upmanship.\nEspecially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,\nand you say, "How about eight o\'clock?"\nthey\'re likely to tell you, "Eight o\'clock is too late for me,\nbut that\'s okay, I can get a game of tennis in\nand do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."\nAnd they think that means\nthat they are so incredibly busy and productive,\nbut the truth is they\'re not,\nbecause we, at the moment,\nhave had brilliant leaders\nin business, in finance, in politics,\nmaking terrible decisions.\nSo a high I.Q.\ndoes not mean that you\'re a good leader,\nbecause the essence of leadership\nis being able to see the iceberg\nbefore it hits the Titanic.\nAnd we\'ve had far too many icebergs\nhitting our Titanics.'

S"\nThe most massive\ntsunami perfect storm\nis bearing down upon us.\nThis perfect storm\nis mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,\nand we are facing that reality\nwith the full belief\nthat we can solve our problems with technology,\nand that's very understandable.\nNow, this perfect storm that we are facing\nis the result of our rising population,\nrising towards 10 billion people,\nland that is turning to desert,\nand, of course, climate change."
p3716
aS"\nNow there's no question about it at all:\nwe will only solve the problem\nof replacing fossil fuels with technology.\nBut fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --\nare by no means the only thing\nthat is causing climate change."
p3717
aS"\nDesertification\nis a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,\nand this happens only when\nwe create too much bare ground.\nThere's no other cause.\nAnd I intend to focus\non most of the world's land that is turning to desert."
p3718
aS'\nBut I have for you a very simple message\nthat offers more hope than you can imagine.\nWe have environments\nwhere humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.\nOn those, it is almost impossible\nto create vast areas of bare ground.\nNo matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.\nAnd we have environments\nwhere we have months of humidity\nfollowed by months of dryness,\nand that is where desertification is occurring.\nFortunately, with space technology now,\nwe can look at it from space,\nand when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.\nGenerally, what you see in green\nis not desertifying,\nand what you see in brown is,\nand these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.\nAbout two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.'
p3719
aS"\nI took this picture in the Tihamah Desert\nwhile 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.\nThink of it in terms of drums of water,\neach containing 200 liters.\nOver 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare\nof that land that day.\nThe next day, the land looked like this.\nWhere had that water gone?\nSome of it ran off as flooding,\nbut most of the water that soaked into the soil\nsimply evaporated out again,\nexactly as it does in your garden\nif you leave the soil uncovered.\nNow, because the fate of water and carbon\nare tied to soil organic matter,\nwhen we damage soils, you give off carbon.\nCarbon goes back to the atmosphere."
p3720
aS"\nNow you're told over and over, repeatedly,\nthat desertification is only occurring\nin arid and semi-arid areas of the world,\nand that tall grasslands like this one\nin high rainfall are of no consequence.\nBut if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,\nyou find that most of the soil in that grassland\nthat you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,\nleading to increased runoff and evaporation.\nThat is the cancer of desertification\nthat we do not recognize till its terminal form."
p3721
aS'\nNow we know that desertification is caused by livestock,\nmostly cattle, sheep and goats,\novergrazing the plants,\nleaving the soil bare and giving off methane.\nAlmost everybody knows this,\nfrom nobel laureates to golf caddies,\nor was taught it, as I was.\nNow, the environments like you see here,\ndusty environments in Africa where I grew up,\nand I loved wildlife,\nand so I grew up hating livestock\nbecause of the damage they were doing.\nAnd then my university education as an ecologist\nreinforced my beliefs.'
p3722
aS'\nWell, I have news for you.\nWe were once just as certain\nthat the world was flat.\nWe were wrong then, and we are wrong again.\nAnd I want to invite you now\nto come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.'
p3723
aS'\nWhen I was a young man,\na young biologist in Africa,\nI was involved in setting aside marvelous areas\nas future national parks.\nNow no sooner  this was in the 1950s \nand no sooner did we remove the hunting,\ndrum-beating people to protect the animals,\nthan the land began to deteriorate,\nas you see in this park that we formed.\nNow, no livestock were involved,\nbut suspecting that we had too many elephants now,\nI did the research and I proved we had too many,\nand I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers\nand bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.\nNow, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,\nand it was political dynamite, frankly.\nSo our government formed a team of experts\nto evaluate my research.\nThey did. They agreed with me,\nand over the following years,\nwe shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.\nAnd it got worse, not better.\nLoving elephants as I do,\nthat was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,\nand I will carry that to my grave.\nOne good thing did come out of it.\nIt made me absolutely determined\nto devote my life to finding solutions.'
p3724
aS'\nWhen I came to the United States, I got a shock,\nto find national parks like this one\ndesertifying as badly as anything in Africa.\nAnd there\'d been no livestock on this land\nfor over 70 years.\nAnd I found that American scientists\nhad no explanation for this\nexcept that it is arid and natural.\nSo I then began looking\nat all the research plots I could\nover the whole of the Western United States\nwhere cattle had been removed\nto prove that it would stop desertification,\nbut I found the opposite,\nas we see on this research station,\nwhere this grassland that was green in 1961,\nby 2002 had changed to that situation.\nAnd the authors of the position paper on climate change\nfrom which I obtained these pictures\nattribute this change to "unknown processes."'
p3725
aS"\nClearly, we have never understood\nwhat is causing desertification,\nwhich has destroyed many civilizations\nand now threatens us globally.\nWe have never understood it.\nTake one square meter of soil\nand make it bare like this is down here,\nand I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn\nand much hotter at midday\nthan that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,\nplant litter.\nYou have changed the microclimate.\nNow, by the time you are doing that\nand increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground\non more than half the world's land,\nyou are changing macroclimate.\nBut we have just simply not understood\nwhy was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?\nWhy has it accelerated lately?\nWe had no understanding of that."
p3726
aS'\nWhat we had failed to understand\nwas that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,\nthe soil and the vegetation\ndeveloped with very large numbers of grazing animals,\nand that these grazing animals\ndeveloped with ferocious pack-hunting predators.\nNow, the main defense against pack-hunting predators\nis to get into herds,\nand the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.\nNow, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,\nand they have to keep moving,\nand it was that movement\nthat prevented the overgrazing of plants,\nwhile the periodic trampling\nensured good cover of the soil,\nas we see where a herd has passed.'
p3727
aS"\nThis picture is a typical seasonal grassland.\nIt has just come through four months of rain,\nand it's now going into eight months of dry season.\nAnd watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.\nNow, all of that grass you see aboveground\nhas to decay biologically\nbefore the next growing season, and if it doesn't,\nthe grassland and the soil begin to die.\nNow, if it does not decay biologically,\nit shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,\nand this smothers and kills grasses,\nleading to a shift to woody vegetation\nand bare soil, releasing carbon.\nTo prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.\nBut fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,\nand worse than that,\nburning one hectare of grassland\ngives off more, and more damaging, pollutants\nthan 6,000 cars.\nAnd we are burning in Africa, every single year,\nmore than one billion hectares of grasslands,\nand almost nobody is talking about it.\nWe justify the burning, as scientists,\nbecause it does remove the dead material\nand it allows the plants to grow."
p3728
aS"\nNow, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,\nwhat could we do to keep that healthy?\nAnd bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.\nOkay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more\nwithout causing desertification and climate change.\nWe cannot burn it without causing\ndesertification and climate change.\nWhat are we going to do?\nThere is only one option,\nI'll repeat to you, only one option\nleft to climatologists and scientists,\nand that is to do the unthinkable,\nand to use livestock,\nbunched and moving,\nas a proxy for former herds and predators,\nand mimic nature.\nThere is no other alternative left to mankind."
p3729
aS"\nSo let's do that.\nSo on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.\nWe'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,\nand we've done so, and look at that.\nAll of that grass is now covering the soil\nas dung, urine and litter or mulch,\nas every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,\nand that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,\nto store carbon, and to break down methane.\nAnd we did that,\nwithout using fire to damage the soil,\nand the plants are free to grow."
p3730
aS"\nWhen I first realized\nthat we had no option as scientists\nbut to use much-vilified livestock\nto address climate change and desertification,\nI was faced with a real dilemma.\nHow were we to do it?\nWe'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists\nbunching and moving their animals,\nbut they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.\nThen we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,\nand that had accelerated desertification,\nas we first discovered in Africa\nand then confirmed in the United States,\nand as you see in this picture\nof land managed by the federal government.\nClearly more was needed\nthan bunching and moving the animals,\nand humans, over thousands of years,\nhad never been able to deal with nature's complexity.\nBut we biologists and ecologists\nhad never tackled anything as complex as this.\nSo rather than reinvent the wheel,\nI began studying other professions to see if anybody had.\nAnd I found there were planning techniques\nthat I could take and adapt to our biological need,\nand from those I developed what we call\nholistic management and planned grazing,\na planning process,\nand that does address all of nature's complexity\nand our social, environmental, economic complexity."
p3731
aS'\nToday, we have young women like this one\nteaching villages in Africa\nhow to put their animals together into larger herds,\nplan their grazing to mimic nature,\nand where we have them hold their animals overnight --\nwe run them in a predator-friendly manner,\nbecause we have a lot of lands, and so on --\nand where they do this and hold them overnight\nto prepare the crop fields,\nwe are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.'
p3732
aS"\nLet's look at some results.\nThis is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.\nIt has just come through four months of very good rains\nit got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.\nBut as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,\nhas evaporated from the soil surface.\nTheir river is dry despite the rain just having ended,\nand we have 150,000 people\non almost permanent food aid.\nNow let's go to our land nearby on the same day,\nwith the same rainfall, and look at that.\nOur river is flowing and healthy and clean.\nIt's fine.\nThe production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,\neverything is now more productive,\nand we have virtually no fear of dry years.\nAnd we did that by increasing the cattle and goats\n400 percent,\nplanning the grazing to mimic nature\nand integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,\ngiraffe and other animals that we have.\nBut before we began, our land looked like that.\nThis site was bare and eroding for over 30 years\nregardless of what rain we got.\nOkay? Watch the marked tree and see the change\nas we use livestock to mimic nature.\nThis was another site\nwhere it had been bare and eroding,\nand at the base of the marked small tree,\nwe had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?\nAnd again, watch the change\njust using livestock to mimic nature.\nAnd there are fallen trees in there now,\nbecause the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.\nThis land in Mexico was in terrible condition,\nand I've had to mark the hill\nbecause the change is so profound."

aS'\nI began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s\nturn the desert that you see on the right there\nback to grassland,\nand thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land\nwith hope for the future.\nAnd look at the amazing change in this one,\nwhere that gully has completely healed\nusing nothing but livestock mimicking nature,\nand once more, we have the third generation of that family\non that land with their flag still flying.'
p3735
aS'\nThe vast grasslands of Patagonia\nare turning to desert as you see here.\nThe man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,\nand he has documented the steady decline of that land\nover the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.\nThey put 25,000 sheep in one flock,\nreally mimicking nature now with planned grazing,\nand they have documented a 50-percent increase\nin the production of the land in the first year.'
p3736
aS'\nWe now have in the violent Horn of Africa\npastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature\nand openly saying it is the only hope they have\nof saving their families and saving their culture.\nNinety-five percent of that land\ncan only feed people from animals.'
p3737
aS"\nI remind you that I am talking about\nmost of the world's land here that controls our fate,\nincluding the most violent region of the world,\nwhere only animals can feed people\nfrom about 95 percent of the land.\nWhat we are doing globally is causing climate change\nas much as, I believe, fossil fuels,\nand maybe more than fossil fuels.\nBut worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,\nviolence, social breakdown and war,\nand as I am talking to you,\nmillions of men, women and children\nare suffering and dying.\nAnd if this continues,\nwe are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,\neven after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels."
p3738
aS"\nI believe I've shown you how we can work with nature\nat very low cost\nto reverse all this.\nWe are already doing so\non about 15 million hectares\non five continents,\nand people who understand\nfar more about carbon than I do\ncalculate that, for illustrative purposes,\nif we do what I am showing you here,\nwe can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere\nand safely store it in the grassland soils\nfor thousands of years,\nand if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands\nthat I've shown you,\nwe can take us back to pre-industrial levels,\nwhile feeding people.\nI can think of almost nothing\nthat offers more hope for our planet,\nfor your children,\nand their children, and all of humanity."

p3749
aS"\nBut what if it wasn't?\nWhat if it was from a source like this?\nThen statistics would actually say\nthat half of you would now be suffering\nwith diarrhea.\nI talked a lot in the past about statistics,\nand the provision of safe drinking water for all.\nBut they just don't seem to get through.\nAnd I think I've worked out why.\nIt's because, using current thinking,\nthe scale of the problem\njust seems too huge to contemplate solving.\nSo we just switch off:\nus, governments and aid agencies.\nWell, today, I'd like to show you\nthat through thinking differently,\nthe problem has been solved.\nBy the way, since I've been speaking,\nanother 13,000 people around the world\nare suffering now with diarrhea.\nAnd four children have just died."
p3750
aS'\nI invented Lifesaver bottle\nbecause I got angry.\nI, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,\nwhen I was watching the devastating news\nof the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,\nplaying out on TV.\nThe days and weeks that followed,\npeople fleeing to the hills,\nbeing forced to drink contaminated water\nor face death.\nThat really stuck with me.\nThen, a few months later,\nHurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.\n"Okay," I thought, "here\'s a First World country, let\'s see what they can do."\nDay one: nothing.\nDay two: nothing.\nDo you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?\nPeople were shooting each other on the streets\nfor TV sets and water.\nThat\'s when I decided I had to do something.'
p3751
aS'\nNow I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,\nand also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)\nHowever, after a few failed prototypes,\nI finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.'
p3752
aS"\nOkay, now for the science bit.\nBefore Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable\nof filtering down to about 200 nanometers.\nThe smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.\nSo a 200-nanometer bacteria\nis going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.\nThe smallest virus, on the other hand,\nis about 25 nanometers.\nSo that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.\nLifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.\nSo nothing is getting through."
p3753
aS"\nOkay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.\nWould you like to see that?\nI spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.\nWe're in the fine city of Oxford.\nSo -- someone's done that up.\nFine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone\nand got some water from the River Cherwell,\nand the River Thames,\nthat flow through here. And this is the water.\nBut I got to thinking, you know,\nif we were in the middle of a flood zone\nin Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.\nSo I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.\nAnd this is from my pond."
p3754
aS'\n(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.'

p3757
aS"\nMichael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff\nfrom a sewage plant farm.\nSo I'm just going to put that in there.\n(Laughter)\nPut that in there. There we go.\n(Laughter)\nAnd some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.\nAnd I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.\nSo we're just going to put that in there as well.\n(Laughter)\nOkay. (Laughter) Now."
p3758
aS"\nThe Lifesaver bottle works really simply.\nYou just scoop the water up.\nToday I'm going to use a jug\njust to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.\nThat's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.\nOkay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,\nand put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?\n(Laughter)\nOkay. There we go.\nReplace the top.\nGive it a few pumps. Okay?\nThat's all that's necessary.\nNow as soon as I pop the teat,\nsterile drinking water is going to come out.\nI've got to be quick. Okay, ready?\nThere we go. Mind the electrics.\nThat is safe, sterile drinking water.\n(Applause)\nCheers.\n(Applause)\nThere you go Chris.\n(Applause)\nWhat's it taste of?"
p3759
aS'\nChris Anderson: Delicious.'
p3760
aS"\nMichael Pritchard: Okay.\nLet's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?\n(Laughter)"
p3761
aS"\nOkay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.\nIt'll last for 6,000 liters.\nAnd when it's expired, using failsafe technology,\nthe system will shut off, protecting the user.\nPop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.\nIt's good for another 6,000 liters."
p3762
aS"\nSo let's look at the applications.\nTraditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?\nWe ship water.\nThen, after a few weeks, we set up camps.\nAnd people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.\nWhat happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?\nDiseases spread. More resources are required.\nThe problem just becomes self-perpetuating.\nBut by thinking differently,\nand shipping these,\npeople can stay put.\nThey can make their own sterile drinking water,\nand start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives."
p3763
aS'\nNow, it doesn\'t require a natural disaster\nfor this to work.\nUsing the old thinking, of national infrastructure\nand pipe work, is too expensive.\nWhen you run the numbers on a calculator,\nyou run out of noughts.\nSo here is the "thinking different" bit.'
p3764
aS"\nInstead of shipping water,\nand using man-made processes to do it,\nlet's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.\nShe picks the water up from there,\ndesalinates it, for free, transports it over there,\nand dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.\nAnd where do people live? Near water.\nAll we've go to do\nis make it sterile. How do we do that?"
p3765
aS"\nWell, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.\nOr we could use one of these.\nThe same technology, in a jerry can.\nThis will process 25,000 liters of water;\nthat's good enough for a family of four,\nfor three years.\nAnd how much does it cost?\nAbout half a cent a day to run.\nThank you."
p3766
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3767
aS"\nSo, by thinking differently, and processing water\nat the point of use,\nmothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day\nto collect their water.\nThey can get it from a source nearby.\nSo with just eight billion dollars,\nwe can hit the millennium goal's target\nof halving the number of people\nwithout access to safe drinking water.\nTo put that into context,\nThe U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds\na year on foreign aid.\nBut why stop there?\nWith 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.\nSo the three-and-a-half billion people\nthat suffer every year as a result,\nand the two million kids that die every year,\nwill live.\nThank you."

S"\nI told you three things last year.\nI told you that the statistics of the world\nhave not been made properly available.\nBecause of that, we still have the old mindset\nof developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.\nAnd that animated graphics can make a difference.\nThings are changing\nand today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,\nit says, by first of May, full access to the databases.\n(Applause)\nAnd if I could share the image with you on the screen.\nSo three things have happened.\nU.N. opened their statistic databases,\nand we have a new version of the software\nup working as a beta on the net,\nso you don't have to download it any longer."
p3771
aS'\nAnd let me repeat what you saw last year.\nThe bubbles are the countries.\nHere you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --\nand there you have the length of life in years.\nThis is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,\nthose were developing countries.\nAt that time there was a "we" and "them."\nThere was a huge difference in the world.\nBut then it changed, and it went on quite well.'
p3772
aS"\nAnd this is what happens.\nYou can see how China is the red, big bubble.\nThe blue there is India.\nAnd they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be\na little more serious this year in showing you\nhow things really changed.\nAnd it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?\nLarge families still, and the HIV epidemic\nbrought down the countries like this.\nThis is more or less what we saw last year,\nand this is how it will go on into the future."
p3773
aS"\nAnd I will talk on, is this possible?\nBecause you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.\nBecause this is where we are.\nWill it be possible that this will happen?\nI cover my lifetime here, you know?\nI expect to live 100 years.\nAnd this is where we are today.\nNow could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?\nAnd I would like to show that against child survival.\nWe'll swap the axis.\nHere you have child mortality -- that is, survival --\nfour kids dying there, 200 dying there.\nAnd this is GDP per capita on this axis.\nAnd this was 2007."
p3774
aS"\nAnd if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --\nhere we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.\nSome countries still had statistics.\nWe are looking down in the archive,\nand when we are down into 1820,\nthere is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.\n(Laughter)\nBut they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.\nAnd they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday."
p3775
aS"\nSo this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.\nHow they got slowly richer and richer,\nand they add statistics.\nIsn't it beautiful when they get statistics?\nYou see the importance of that?\nAnd here, children don't live longer.\nThe last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,\nbecause most of this statistics is Europe.\nIt was only by the turn of the century\nthat more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.\nThis is India coming up, with the first data from India.\nAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.\nAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.\nAnd it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,\nnot getting so rich.\nThere he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.\nIt moves this way over here.\nAnd the bubbles keep moving up there,\nand this is what the world looks like today.\n(Applause)"
p3776
aS'\nLet us have a look at the United States.\nWe have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."\nAnd I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --\nI put them up like this, and now we go backwards.\nAnd we can see that the United States\ngoes to the right of the mainstream.\nThey are on the money side all the time.\nAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --\npresent, contemporary India.\nAnd that means United States was richer,\nbut lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.\nAnd look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.\nThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy\nas the United States during the First World War.\nBut we have to bring United States forward quite a while\nto find the same health of the United States\nas we have in the Philippines.\nAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States\nis the same as the Philippines.\nAnd this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,\nis that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,\nare much more ahead in being healthy, educated,\nhaving human resources than they are economically.'

aS"\nThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today\nin the emerging economies.\nThere now, social benefits, social progress,\nare going ahead of economical progress.\nAnd 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.\nAnd how long do we have to bring United States\nto get the same health as Chile has today?\nI think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --\nthe United States has the same health as Chile.\nChile's catching up!\nWithin some years Chile may have better child survival\nthan the United States.\nThis is really a change, that you have this lag\nof more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health."
p3778
aS"\nAnd behind the health is the educational level.\nAnd there's a lot of infrastructure things,\nand general human resources are there.\nNow we can take away this --\nand I would like to show you the rate of speed,\nthe rate of change, how fast they have gone.\nAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.\nAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States.\nAnd I'm going to stage a race here\nbetween this sort of yellowish Ford here\nand the red Toyota down there,\nand the brownish Volvo.\n(Laughter)\nAnd here we go. Here we go.\nThe Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,\nand the United States Ford is going off-road there.\nAnd the Volvo is doing quite fine.\nThis is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now\nthe Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --\ncan you see that?\nAnd they are taking over Sweden,\nand they are now healthier than Sweden.\nThat's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.\n(Laughter)\nAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.\nThey really caught up."
p3779
aS"\nAnd this changes gradually.\nWe have to look over generations to understand it.\nAnd let me show you my own sort of family history --\nwe made these graphs here.\nAnd this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?\nAnd this is my family.\nThis is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.\nSweden was like Sierra Leone today.\nAnd this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.\nAnd Sweden was like Mozambique.\nAnd this is when my grandma was born, 1891.\nShe took care of me as a child,\nso I'm not talking about statistic now --\nnow it's oral history in my family.\nThat's when I believe statistics,\nwhen it's grandma-verified statistics.\n(Laughter)\nI think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.\nSweden was like Ghana.\nIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity\nwithin sub-Saharan Africa.\nI told you last year, I'll tell you again,\nmy mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?\nI'm the Mexican in the family.\nAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile,\nand the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,\nnow the healthiest country on this Earth.\nIt bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,\nwith better child survival.\nBut they're very small, you know?\nThey're so close to the hospital we can never\nbeat them out in these forests.\n(Laughter)\nBut homage to Singapore."
p3780
aS"\nSingapore is the best one.\nNow this looks also like a very good story.\nBut it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.\nBecause I have to show you one of the other facilities.\nWe can also make the color here represent the variable --\nand what am I choosing here?\nCarbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.\nThis is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.\nAnd China was emitting 0.6,\nand India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.\nAnd what happens when we moved on?\nWell, you see the nice story of getting richer\nand getting healthier --\neveryone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.\nThere is no one who has done it so far.\nAnd we don't have all the updated data\nany longer, because this is really hot data today.\nAnd there we are, 2001."
p3781
aS'\nAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,\nmany say now the problem is that the emerging economies,\nthey are getting out too much carbon dioxide.\nThe Minister of the Environment of India said,\n"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."\nThe OECD countries -- the high-income countries --\nthey were the ones who caused the climate change.\n"But we forgive you, because you didn\'t know it.\nBut from now on, we count per capita.\nFrom now on we count per capita.\nAnd everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."'
p3782
aS"\nThis really shows you, we have not seen good economic\nand health progress anywhere in the world\nwithout destroying the climate.\nAnd this is really what has to be changed.\nI've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,\nbut I don't think it's like this.\nThe world is quite a messy place.\nThis we can call Dollar Street.\nEveryone lives on this street here.\nWhat they earn here -- what number they live on --\nis how much they earn per day.\nThis family earns about one dollar per day.\nWe drive up the street here,\nwe find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.\nAnd we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,\nand they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day."
p3783
aS"\nAnd how do they live?\nIf we look at the bed here, we can see\nthat they sleep on a rug on the floor.\nThis is what poverty line is --\n80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,\nthe food for the day.\nThis is two to five dollars. You have a bed.\nAnd here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.\nI lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see\nthe sofa immediately here.\n(Laughter)\nAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.\nAnd the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,\nyou see the family still sitting on the floor there.\nAlthough there is a sofa,\nif you watch in the kitchen, you can see that\nthe great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.\nIt comes beyond here, when you really can get\ngood working conditions in the family.\nAnd if you really want to see the difference,\nyou look at the toilet over here.\nThis can change. This can change.\nThese are all pictures and images from Africa,\nand it can become much better.\nWe can get out of poverty."
p3784
aS"\nMy own research has not been in IT or anything like this.\nI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers\nwho were on the verge of famine.\nAnd this is the result of the farmers-needs research.\nThe nice thing here is that you can't see\nwho are the researchers in this picture.\nThat's when research functions in poor societies --\nyou must really live with the people."
p3785
aS'\nWhen you\'re in poverty, everything is about survival.\nIt\'s about having food.\nAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now --\nbecause the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --\nthey discuss with a trained agronomist.\nThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,\nand he\'s discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --\nthe best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.\nAnd they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,\nand that\'s to survive in poverty.\nThat\'s one context.\nGetting out of poverty.\nThe women told us one thing. "Get us technology.\nWe hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.\nGet us a mill so that we can mill our flour,\nthen we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."\nTechnology will bring you out of poverty,\nbut there\'s a need for a market to get away from poverty.\nAnd this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.\nBut she\'s very thankful for the public investment in schooling\nso she can count, and won\'t be cheated when she reaches the market.\nShe wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market\nand doesn\'t have to stay home.\nAnd she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.\nIt\'s also good with credit.\nMicro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.\nAnd information will tell her when to go to market with which product.\nYou can do this.'
p3786
aS"\nI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that\nthe seemingly impossible is possible.\nAfrica has not done bad.\nIn 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation\nto a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,\nwith a functioning nation and state.\nI would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world\nduring the last 50 years.\nBecause we don't consider where they came from.\nIt's this stupid concept of developing countries\nthat puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,\nand says that Mozambique did worse.\nWe have to know a little more about the world.\nI have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.\nHe knows everything.\nHe knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.\nI only know two types of wine -- red and white.\n(Laughter)\nBut my neighbor only knows two types of countries --\nindustrialized and developing.\nAnd I know 200, I know about the small data.\nBut you can do that.\n(Applause)"
p3787
aS"\nBut I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?\nYou make a PowerPoint, you know?\n(Laughter)\nHomage to the Office package, no?\nWhat is this, what is this, what am I telling?\nI'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.\nEveryone wants your pet thing.\nIf you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.\nIf you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,\nyou love equity between gender.\nOr if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.\nOn the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.\nWe need everything.\nAll these things are important for development,\nespecially when you just get out of poverty\nand you should go towards welfare."
p3788
aS"\nNow, what we need to think about\nis, what is a goal for development,\nand what are the means for development?\nLet me first grade what are the most important means.\nEconomic growth to me, as a public-health professor,\nis the most important thing for development\nbecause it explains 80 percent of survival.\nGovernance. To have a government which functions --\nthat's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.\nIt was the government that made law function finally.\nEducation, human resources are important.\nHealth is also important, but not that much as a mean.\nEnvironment is important.\nHuman rights is also important, but it just gets one cross."
p3789
aS"\nNow what about goals? Where are we going toward?\nWe are not interested in money.\nMoney is not a goal.\nIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.\nGovernance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,\nbut it's not a goal.\nAnd going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.\nHealth I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy\n-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.\nAnd that's good, it gets two plusses.\nEnvironment is very, very crucial.\nThere's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.\nBut where are the important goals?\nOf course, it's human rights.\nHuman rights is the goal,\nbut it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.\nAnd culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,\nbecause that's what brings joy to life.\nThat's the value of living."
p3790
aS"\nSo the seemingly impossible is possible.\nEven African countries can achieve this.\nAnd I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.\nAnd remember, please remember my main message,\nwhich is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.\nWe can have a good world.\nI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,\nand I think I will convince you also by culture.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nBring me my sword!\nSword swallowing is from ancient India.\nIt's a cultural expression that for thousands of years\nhas inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible\nby taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --\nthis is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,\nin the last year we had war.\nAnd it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.\nAnd I'm going to take this blade of steel,\nand push it down through my body of blood and flesh,\nand prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.\nCan I request a moment of absolute silence?\n(Applause)"

p3797
aS"\nAnd researchers want to know why.\nI mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study\nto figure out what makes a marriage not work.\nDisrespect, boredom,\ntoo much time on Facebook,\nhaving sex with other people.\nBut you can have the exact opposite of all of those things --\nrespect, excitement,\na broken Internet connection,\nmind-numbing monogamy --\nand the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket.\nSo what's going on when it doesn't?\nWhat do the folks who make it\nall the way to side-by-side burial plots\nhave in common?\nWhat are they doing right?\nWhat can we learn from them?\nAnd if you're still happily sleeping solo,\nwhy should you stop what you're doing\nand make it your life's work\nto find that one special person\nthat you can annoy for the rest of your life?"
p3798
aS"\nWell researchers spend billions of your tax dollars\ntrying to figure that out.\nThey stalk blissful couples\nand they study their every move and mannerism.\nAnd they try to pinpoint what it is\nthat sets them apart\nfrom their miserable neighbors and friends.\nAnd it turns out,\nthe success stories\nshare a few similarities,\nactually, beyond they don't have sex with other people."
p3799
aS"\nFor instance, in the happiest marriages,\nthe wife is thinner and better looking than the husband.\n(Laughter)\nObvious, right.\nIt's obvious that this leads to marital bliss\nbecause, women, we care a great deal\nabout being thin and good looking,\nwhereas men mostly care about sex ...\nideally with women\nwho are thinner and better looking than they are.\nThe beauty of this research though\nis that no one is suggesting\nthat women have to be thin to be happy;\nwe just have to be thinner than our partners.\nSo instead of all that laborious\ndieting and exercising,\nwe just need to wait for them to get fat,\nmaybe bake a few pies.\nThis is good information to have,\nand it's not that complicated."
p3800
aS'\nResearch also suggests\nthat the happiest couples\nare the ones that focus on the positives.\nFor example, the happy wife.\nInstead of pointing out her husband\'s growing gut\nor suggesting he go for a run,\nshe might say,\n"Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way\nto make me relatively thinner."\nThese are couples who can find good in any situation.\n"Yeah, it was devastating\nwhen we lost everything in that fire,\nbut it\'s kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars,\nand it\'s a good thing you\'ve got all that body fat\nto keep us warm."'
p3801
aS"\nOne of my favorite studies found\nthat the more willing a husband is to do house work,\nthe more attractive his wife will find him.\nBecause we needed a study to tell us this.\nBut here's what's going on here.\nThe more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have;\nthe more sex they have, the nicer he is to her;\nthe nicer he is to her,\nthe less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed --\nand ultimately, they live happily ever after.\nIn other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch\nin the domestic department."
p3802
aS"\nHere's an interesting one.\nOne study found\nthat people who smile in childhood photographs\nare less likely to get a divorce.\nThis is an actual study,\nand let me clarify.\nThe researchers were not looking\nat documented self-reports of childhood happiness\nor even studying old journals.\nThe data were based entirely\non whether people looked happy\nin these early pictures.\nNow I don't know how old all of you are,\nbut when I was a kid,\nyour parents took pictures with a special kind of camera\nthat held something called film,\nand, by God, film was expensive.\nThey didn't take 300 shots of you\nin that rapid-fire digital video mode\nand then pick out the nicest, smileyest one\nfor the Christmas card.\nOh no.\nThey dressed you up, they lined you up,\nand you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to\nor you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.\nBut still, I have a huge pile\nof fake happy childhood pictures\nand I'm glad they make me less likely than some people\nto get a divorce."
p3803
aS"\nSo what else can you do\nto safeguard your marriage?\nDo not win an Oscar for best actress.\n(Laughter)\nI'm serious.\nBettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank,\nSandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon,\nall of them single\nsoon after taking home that statue.\nThey actually call it the Oscar curse.\nIt is the marriage kiss of death\nand something that should be avoided."
p3804
aS"\nAnd it's not just successfully starring in films\nthat's dangerous.\nIt turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy\ncauses relationship satisfaction to plummet.\n(Laughter)\nApparently, the bitter realization\nthat maybe it could happen to us,\nbut it obviously hasn't and it probably never will,\nmakes our lives seem unbearably grim\nin comparison.\nAnd theoretically,\nI suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered\nor dies in a fiery car crash,\nwe are more likely to walk out of that theater\nfeeling like we've got it pretty good."
p3805
aS"\nDrinking alcohol, it seems,\nis bad for your marriage.\nYeah.\nI can't tell you anymore about that one\nbecause I stopped reading it at the headline.\nBut here's a scary one:\nDivorce is contagious.\nThat's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up,\nit increases your chances of getting a divorce\nby 75 percent.\nNow I have to say, I don't get this one at all.\nMy husband and I\nhave watched quite a few friends divide their assets\nand then struggle\nwith being our age and single\nin an age of sexting and Viagra\nand eHarmony.\nAnd I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage\nthan a lifetime of therapy ever could."
p3806
aS"\nSo now you may be wondering,\nwhy does anyone get married ever?\nWell the U.S. federal government\ncounts more than a thousand legal benefits\nto being someone's spouse --\na list that includes visitation rights in jail,\nbut hopefully you'll never need that one.\nBut beyond the profound federal perks,\nmarried people make more money.\nWe're healthier,\nphysically and emotionally.\nWe produce happier, more stable\nand more successful kids.\nWe have more sex\nthan our supposedly swinging single friends --\nbelieve it or not.\nWe even live longer,\nwhich is a pretty compelling argument\nfor marrying someone you like a lot\nin the first place."
p3807
aS"\nNow if you're not currently experiencing\nthe joy of the joint tax return,\nI can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person\nof the approximately ideal size and attractiveness\nwho prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends\nhovering on the brink of divorce,\nbut I can only encourage you to try,\nbecause the benefits, as I've pointed out,\nare significant.\nThe bottom line is, whether you're in it or you're searching for it,\nI believe marriage is an institution\nworth pursuing and protecting.\nSo I hope you'll use the information I've given you today\nto weigh your personal strengths\nagainst your own risk factors."
p3808
aS"\nFor instance, in my marriage,\nI'd say I'm doing okay.\nOne the one hand,\nI have a husband who's annoyingly lean\nand incredibly handsome.\nSo I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.\nAnd like I said, we have those divorced friends\nwho may secretly or subconsciously\nbe trying to break us up.\nSo we have to keep an eye on that.\nAnd we do like a cocktail or two.\nOn the other hand,\nI have the fake happy picture thing.\nAnd also, my husband does a lot around the house,\nand would happily never see\nanother romantic comedy as long as he lives."
p3809
aS"\nSo I've got all those things going for me.\nBut just in case,\nI plan to work extra hard\nto not win an Oscar anytime soon.\nAnd for the good of your relationships,\nI would encourage you to do the same.\nI'll see you at the bar."

S"\nThe day I left home for the first time\nto go to university was a bright day\nbrimming with hope and optimism.\nI'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high,\nand I gleefully entered the student life\nof lectures, parties and traffic cone theft."
p3813
aS'\nNow appearances, of course, can be deceptive,\nand to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona\nof lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer,\nalbeit a very well-crafted and convincing one.\nUnderneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure\nand fundamentally frightened --\nfrightened of other people, of the future, of failure\nand of the emptiness that I felt was within me.\nBut I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside\nappeared to be someone with everything to hope for\nand aspire to.\nThis fantasy of invulnerability was so complete\nthat I even deceived myself,\nand as the first semester ended and the second began,\nthere was no way that anyone could have predicted\nwhat was just about to happen.'
p3814
aS'\nI was leaving a seminar when it started,\nhumming to myself, fumbling with my bag\njust as I\'d done a hundred times before,\nwhen suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe,\n"She is leaving the room."'
p3815
aS'\nI looked around, and there was no one there,\nbut the clarity and decisiveness of the comment\nwas unmistakable.\nShaken, I left my books on the stairs and hurried home,\nand there it was again.\n"She is opening the door."'
p3816
aS'\nThis was the beginning. The voice had arrived.\nAnd the voice persisted,\ndays and then weeks of it, on and on,\nnarrating everything I did in the third person.'
p3817
aS'\n"She is going to the library."'
p3818
aS'\n"She is going to a lecture."\nIt was neutral, impassive and even, after a while,\nstrangely companionate and reassuring,\nalthough I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped\nand that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.\nSo, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it,\nwhich I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt,\nthen the voice would sound frustrated.\nOtherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing,\nalthough even at that point it was clear\nthat it had something to communicate to me\nabout my emotions, particularly emotions\nwhich were remote and inaccessible.'
p3819
aS"\nNow it was then that I made a fatal mistake,\nin that I told a friend about the voice, and she was horrified.\nA subtle conditioning process had begun,\nthe implication that normal people don't hear voices\nand the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.\nSuch fear and mistrust was infectious.\nSuddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore,\nand when she insisted that I seek medical attention,\nI duly complied, and which proved to be\nmistake number two."
p3820
aS'\nI spent some time telling the college G.P.\nabout what I perceived to be the real problem:\nanxiety, low self-worth, fears about the future,\nand was met with bored indifference\nuntil I mentioned the voice,\nupon which he dropped his pen, swung round\nand began to question me with a show of real interest.\nAnd to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help,\nand I began to tell him about my strange commentator.\nAnd I always wish, at this point, the voice had said,\n"She is digging her own grave."'
p3821
aS'\nI was referred to a psychiatrist, who likewise\ntook a grim view of the voice\'s presence,\nsubsequently interpreting everything I said\nthrough a lens of latent insanity.\nFor example, I was part of a student TV station\nthat broadcast news bulletins around the campus,\nand during an appointment which was running very late,\nI said, "I\'m sorry, doctor, I\'ve got to go.\nI\'m reading the news at six."\nNow it\'s down on my medical records that Eleanor\nhas delusions that she\'s a television news broadcaster.'
p3822
aS'\nIt was at this point that events began\nto rapidly overtake me.\nA hospital admission followed, the first of many,\na diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,\nand then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense\nof hopelessness, humiliation and despair\nabout myself and my prospects.'
p3823
aS'\nBut having been encouraged to see the voice\nnot as an experience but as a symptom,\nmy fear and resistance towards it intensified.\nNow essentially, this represented taking\nan aggressive stance towards my own mind,\na kind of psychic civil war,\nand in turn this caused the number of voices to increase\nand grow progressively hostile and menacing.\nHelplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat\ninto this nightmarish inner world\nin which the voices were destined to become\nboth my persecutors and my only perceived companions.\nThey told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy\nof their help, then they could change my life\nback to how it had been,\nand a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set,\na kind of labor of Hercules.\nIt started off quite small, for example,\npull out three strands of hair,\nbut gradually it grew more extreme,\nculminating in commands to harm myself,\nand a particularly dramatic instruction:'
p3824
aS'\n"You see that tutor over there?\nYou see that glass of water?\nWell, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."'
p3825
aS'\nWhich I actually did, and which needless to say\ndid not endear me to the faculty.'
p3826
aS'\nIn effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance,\nmistrust and misunderstanding had been established,\nand this was a battle in which I felt powerless\nand incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.'
p3827
aS'\nTwo years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.\nBy now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire:\nterrifying voices, grotesque visions,\nbizarre, intractable delusions.\nMy mental health status had been a catalyst\nfor discrimination, verbal abuse,\nand physical and sexual assault,\nand I\'d been told by my psychiatrist,\n"Eleanor, you\'d be better off with cancer,\nbecause cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia."\nI\'d been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,\nand was by now so tormented by the voices\nthat I attempted to drill a hole in my head\nin order to get them out.'
p3828
aS'\nNow looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years,\nit seems to me now as if someone died in that place,\nand yet, someone else was saved.\nA broken and haunted person began that journey,\nbut the person who emerged was a survivor\nand would ultimately grow into the person\nI was destined to be.'
p3829
aS'\nMany people have harmed me in my life,\nand I remember them all,\nbut the memories grow pale and faint\nin comparison with the people who\'ve helped me.\nThe fellow survivors, the fellow voice-hearers,\nthe comrades and collaborators;\nthe mother who never gave up on me,\nwho knew that one day I would come back to her\nand was willing to wait for me for as long as it took;\nthe doctor who only worked with me for a brief time\nbut who reinforced his belief that recovery\nwas not only possible but inevitable,\nand during a devastating period of relapse\ntold my terrified family, "Don\'t give up hope.\nI believe that Eleanor can get through this.\nSometimes, you know, it snows as late as May,\nbut summer always comes eventually."'
p3830
aS"\nFourteen minutes is not enough time\nto fully credit those good and generous people\nwho fought with me and for me\nand who waited to welcome me back\nfrom that agonized, lonely place.\nBut together, they forged a blend of courage,\ncreativity, integrity, and an unshakeable belief\nthat my shattered self could become healed and whole.\nI used to say that these people saved me,\nbut what I now know is they did something\neven more important in that they empowered me\nto save myself,\nand crucially, they helped me to understand something\nwhich I'd always suspected:\nthat my voices were a meaningful response\nto traumatic life events, particularly childhood events,\nand as such were not my enemies\nbut a source of insight into solvable emotional problems."

aS"\nNow, at first, this was very difficult to believe,\nnot least because the voices appeared so hostile\nand menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step\nwas learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning\nfrom what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.\nSo for example, voices which threatened to attack my home\nI learned to interpret as my own sense of fear\nand insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger."
p3832
aS'\nNow at first, I would have believed them.\nI remember, for example, sitting up one night\non guard outside my parents\' room to protect them\nfrom what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.\nBecause I\'d had such a bad problem with self-injury\nthat most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden,\nso I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork,\nkind of like picnic ware, and sort of sat outside the room\nclutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen.\nIt was like, "Don\'t mess with me.\nI\'ve got a plastic fork, don\'t you know?"\nStrategic.'
p3833
aS"\nBut a later response, and much more useful,\nwould be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words,\nso when the voices warned me not to leave the house,\nthen I would thank them for drawing my attention\nto how unsafe I felt --\nbecause if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it --\nbut go on to reassure both them and myself\nthat we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.\nI would set boundaries for the voices,\nand try to interact with them in a way that was assertive\nyet respectful, establishing a slow process\nof communication and collaboration\nin which we could learn to work together and support one another."
p3834
aS"\nThroughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize\nwas that each voice was closely related\nto aspects of myself, and that each of them\ncarried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had\nan opportunity to process or resolve,\nmemories of sexual trauma and abuse,\nof anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.\nThe voices took the place of this pain\nand gave words to it,\nand possibly one of the greatest revelations\nwas when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices\nactually represented the parts of me\nthat had been hurt most profoundly,\nand as such, it was these voices\nthat needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care."
p3835
aS"\nIt was armed with this knowledge that ultimately\nI would gather together my shattered self,\neach fragment represented by a different voice,\ngradually withdraw from all my medication,\nand return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.\nTen years after the voice first came, I finally graduated,\nthis time with the highest degree in psychology\nthe university had ever given, and one year later,\nthe highest masters, which shall we say\nisn't bad for a madwoman.\nIn fact, one of the voices actually dictated the answers\nduring the exam, which technically possibly counts as cheating."
p3836
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3837
aS"\nAnd to be honest, sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well.\nAs Oscar Wilde has said, the only thing worse\nthan being talked about is not being talked about.\nIt also makes you very good at eavesdropping,\nbecause you can listen to two conversations simultaneously.\nSo it's not all bad."
p3838
aS"\nI worked in mental health services,\nI spoke at conferences,\nI published book chapters and academic articles,\nand I argued, and continue to do so,\nthe relevance of the following concept:\nthat an important question in psychiatry\nshouldn't be what's wrong with you\nbut rather what's happened to you.\nAnd all the while, I listened to my voices,\nwith whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect\nand which in turn reflected a growing sense\nof compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.\nAnd I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment\nwhen supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices,\nand becoming fully aware, for the very first time,\nthat I no longer felt that way myself\nbut was finally able to help someone else who was."
p3839
aS"\nI'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice,\nthe organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement,\nan initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme\nand Dr. Sandra Escher,\nwhich locates voice hearing as a survival strategy,\na sane reaction to insane circumstances,\nnot as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured,\nbut a complex, significant and meaningful experience\nto be explored.\nTogether, we envisage and enact a society\nthat understands and respects voice hearing,\nsupports the needs of individuals who hear voices,\nand which values them as full citizens.\nThis type of society is not only possible,\nit's already on its way.\nTo paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins,\nit cannot be reversed.\nYou cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.\nYou cannot oppress the people\nwho are not afraid anymore."
p3840
aS'\nFor me, the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement\nare a reminder that empathy, fellowship,\njustice and respect are more than words;\nthey are convictions and beliefs,\nand that beliefs can change the world.\nIn the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement\nhas established hearing voices networks\nin 26 countries across five continents,\nworking together to promote dignity, solidarity\nand empowerment for individuals in mental distress,\nto create a new language and practice of hope,\nwhich, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief\nin the power of the individual.'
p3841
aS"\nAs Peter Levine has said, the human animal\nis a unique being\nendowed with an instinctual capacity to heal\nand the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.\nIn this respect, for members of society,\nthere is no greater honor or privilege\nthan facilitating that process of healing for someone,\nto bear witness, to reach out a hand,\nto share the burden of someone's suffering,\nand to hold the hope for their recovery.\nAnd likewise, for survivors of distress and adversity,\nthat we remember we don't have to live our lives\nforever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us.\nWe are unique. We are irreplaceable.\nWhat lies within us can never be truly colonized,\ncontorted, or taken away.\nThe light never goes out."

S'\nSo it\'s 1995,\nI\'m in college,\nand a friend and I go on a road trip\nfrom Providence, Rhode Island\nto Portland, Oregon.\nAnd you know, we\'re young and unemployed,\nso we do the whole thing on back roads\nthrough state parks\nand national forests --\nbasically the longest route we can possibly take.\nAnd somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,\nI turn to my friend\nand I ask her a question\nthat\'s been bothering me\nfor 2,000 miles.\n"What\'s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"\nMy friend looks at me totally blankly.\nThere\'s actually a gentleman in the front row\nwho\'s doing a perfect imitation of her look.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I\'m like, "You know,\nall the signs we keep seeing\nwith the Chinese character on them."\nShe just stares at me for a few moments,\nand then she cracks up,\nbecause she figures out what I\'m talking about.\nAnd what I\'m talking about is this.\n(Laughter)\nRight, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.'
p3847
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3848
aS"\nI've spent the last five years of my life\nthinking about situations\nexactly like this --\nwhy we sometimes misunderstand\nthe signs around us,\nand how we behave when that happens,\nand what all of this can tell us about human nature.\nIn other words, as you heard Chris say,\nI've spent the last five years\nthinking about being wrong.\nThis might strike you as a strange career move,\nbut it actually has one great advantage:\nno job competition.\n(Laughter)\nIn fact, most of us do everything we can\nto avoid thinking about being wrong,\nor at least to avoid thinking about the possibility\nthat we ourselves are wrong.\nWe get it in the abstract.\nWe all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.\nThe human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine."
p3849
aS"\nBut when it comes down to me, right now,\nto all the beliefs I hold,\nhere in the present tense,\nsuddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility\ngoes out the window --\nand I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.\nAnd the thing is, the present tense is where we live.\nWe go to meetings in the present tense;\nwe go on family vacations in the present tense;\nwe go to the polls and vote in the present tense.\nSo effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,\ntrapped in this little bubble\nof feeling very right about everything."
p3850
aS"\nI think this is a problem.\nI think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,\nin our personal and professional lives,\nand I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.\nSo what I want to do today\nis, first of all, talk about why we get stuck\ninside this feeling of being right.\nAnd second, why it's such a problem.\nAnd finally, I want to convince you\nthat it is possible\nto step outside of that feeling\nand that if you can do so,\nit is the single greatest\nmoral, intellectual and creative leap you can make."
p3851
aS"\nSo why do we get stuck\nin this feeling of being right?\nOne reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.\nSo let me ask you guys something --\nor actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:\nHow does it feel -- emotionally --\nhow does it feel to be wrong?\nDreadful. Thumbs down.\nEmbarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.\nDreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --\nthank you, these are great answers,\nbut they're answers to a different question.\nYou guys are answering the question:\nHow does it feel to realize you're wrong?\n(Laughter)\nRealizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?\nI mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,\nit can actually be quite funny,\nlike my stupid Chinese character mistake.\nBut just being wrong\ndoesn't feel like anything."
p3852
aS"\nI'll give you an analogy.\nDo you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon\nwhere there's this pathetic coyote\nwho's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?\nIn pretty much every episode of this cartoon,\nthere's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner\nand the roadrunner runs off a cliff,\nwhich is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.\nBut the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.\nAnd what's funny --\nat least if you're six years old --\nis that the coyote's totally fine too.\nHe just keeps running --\nright up until the moment that he looks down\nand realizes that he's in mid-air.\nThat's when he falls.\nWhen we're wrong about something --\nnot when we realize it, but before that --\nwe're like that coyote\nafter he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.\nYou know, we're already wrong,\nwe're already in trouble,\nbut we feel like we're on solid ground.\nSo I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.\nIt does feel like something to be wrong;\nit feels like being right."
p3853
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3854
aS"\nSo this is one reason, a structural reason,\nwhy we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.\nI call this error blindness.\nMost of the time,\nwe don't have any kind of internal cue\nto let us know that we're wrong about something,\nuntil it's too late.\nBut there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --\nand this one is cultural.\nThink back for a moment to elementary school.\nYou're sitting there in class,\nand your teacher is handing back quiz papers,\nand one of them looks like this.\nThis is not mine, by the way.\n(Laughter)\nSo there you are in grade school,\nand you know exactly what to think\nabout the kid who got this paper.\nIt's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,\nthe one who never does his homework.\nSo by the time you are nine years old,\nyou've already learned, first of all,\nthat people who get stuff wrong\nare lazy, irresponsible dimwits --\nand second of all,\nthat the way to succeed in life\nis to never make any mistakes."
p3855
aS"\nWe learn these really bad lessons really well.\nAnd a lot of us --\nand I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --\ndeal with them by just becoming\nperfect little A students,\nperfectionists, over-achievers.\nRight,\nMr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?\n(Laughter)\nYou're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.\nOkay, so fine.\nExcept that then we freak out\nat the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.\nBecause according to this,\ngetting something wrong\nmeans there's something wrong with us.\nSo we just insist that we're right,\nbecause it makes us feel smart and responsible\nand virtuous and safe."
p3856
aS'\nSo let me tell you a story.\nA couple of years ago,\na woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.\nBeth Israel\'s in Boston.\nIt\'s the teaching hospital for Harvard --\none of the best hospitals in the country.\nSo this woman comes in and she\'s taken into the operating room.\nShe\'s anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --\nstitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.\nEverything seems to have gone fine.\nAnd she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,\nand she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"\nWell the wrong side of her body is in bandages\nbecause the surgeon has performed a major operation\non her left leg instead of her right one.\nWhen the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel\nspoke about this incident,\nhe said something very interesting.\nHe said, "For whatever reason,\nthe surgeon simply felt\nthat he was on the correct side of the patient."\n(Laughter)\nThe point of this story\nis that trusting too much in the feeling\nof being on the correct side of anything\ncan be very dangerous.'
p3857
aS"\nThis internal sense of rightness\nthat we all experience so often\nis not a reliable guide\nto what is actually going on in the external world.\nAnd when we act like it is,\nand we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,\nwell that's when we end up doing things\nlike dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,\nor torpedoing the global economy.\nSo this is a huge practical problem.\nBut it's also a huge social problem."
p3858
aS"\nThink for a moment about what it means to feel right.\nIt means that you think that your beliefs\njust perfectly reflect reality.\nAnd when you feel that way,\nyou've got a problem to solve,\nwhich is, how are you going to explain\nall of those people who disagree with you?\nIt turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,\nby resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.\nThe first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us\nis we just assume they're ignorant.\nThey don't have access to the same information that we do,\nand when we generously share that information with them,\nthey're going to see the light and come on over to our team.\nWhen that doesn't work,\nwhen it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do\nand they still disagree with us,\nthen we move on to a second assumption,\nwhich is that they're idiots.\n(Laughter)\nThey have all the right pieces of the puzzle,\nand they are too moronic to put them together correctly.\nAnd when that doesn't work,\nwhen it turns out that people who disagree with us\nhave all the same facts we do\nand are actually pretty smart,\nthen we move on to a third assumption:\nthey know the truth,\nand they are deliberately distorting it\nfor their own malevolent purposes.\nSo this is a catastrophe."
p3859
aS"\nThis attachment to our own rightness\nkeeps us from preventing mistakes\nwhen we absolutely need to\nand causes us to treat each other terribly.\nBut to me, what's most baffling\nand most tragic about this\nis that it misses the whole point of being human.\nIt's like we want to imagine\nthat our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows\nand we just gaze out of them\nand describe the world as it unfolds.\nAnd we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window\nand see the exact same thing.\nThat is not true,\nand if it were, life would be incredibly boring.\nThe miracle of your mind\nisn't that you can see the world as it is.\nIt's that you can see the world as it isn't.\nWe can remember the past,\nand we can think about the future,\nand we can imagine what it's like\nto be some other person in some other place.\nAnd we all do this a little differently,\nwhich is why we can all look up at the same night sky\nand see this\nand also this\nand also this.\nAnd yeah, it is also why we get things wrong."
p3860
aS'\n1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing\nabout "I think therefore I am,"\nthis guy, St. Augustine, sat down\nand wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --\n"I err therefore I am."\nAugustine understood\nthat our capacity to screw up,\nit\'s not some kind of embarrassing defect\nin the human system,\nsomething we can eradicate or overcome.\nIt\'s totally fundamental to who we are.\nBecause, unlike God,\nwe don\'t really know what\'s going on out there.\nAnd unlike all of the other animals,\nwe are obsessed with trying to figure it out.\nTo me, this obsession\nis the source and root\nof all of our productivity and creativity.'
p3861
aS'\nLast year, for various reasons,\nI found myself listening to a lot of episodes\nof the Public Radio show This American Life.\nAnd so I\'m listening and I\'m listening,\nand at some point, I start feeling\nlike all the stories are about being wrong.\nAnd my first thought was,\n"I\'ve lost it.\nI\'ve become the crazy wrongness lady.\nI just imagined it everywhere,"\nwhich has happened.\nBut a couple of months later,\nI actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who\'s the host of the show.\nAnd I mentioned this to him,\nand he was like, "No actually, that\'s true.\nIn fact," he says,\n"as a staff, we joke\nthat every single episode of our show\nhas the same crypto-theme.\nAnd the crypto-theme is:\n\'I thought this one thing was going to happen\nand something else happened instead.\'\nAnd the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.\nWe need these moments\nof surprise and reversal and wrongness\nto make these stories work."\nAnd for the rest of us, audience members,\nas listeners, as readers,\nwe eat this stuff up.\nWe love things like plot twists\nand red herrings and surprise endings.\nWhen it comes to our stories,\nwe love being wrong.'
p3862
aS'\nBut, you know, our stories are like this\nbecause our lives are like this.\nWe think this one thing is going to happen\nand something else happens instead.\nGeorge Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,\nfind a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,\nliberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.\nAnd something else happened instead.\nAnd Hosni Mubarak\nthought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,\nuntil he got too old or too sick\nand could pass the reigns of power onto his son.\nAnd something else happened instead.\nAnd maybe you thought\nyou were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart\nand move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.\nAnd something else happened instead.\nAnd I have to tell you\nthat I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book\nabout a subject everybody hates\nfor an audience that would never materialize.\nAnd something else happened instead.'
p3863
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3864
aS"\nI mean, this is life.\nFor good and for ill,\nwe generate these incredible stories\nabout the world around us,\nand then the world turns around and astonishes us.\nNo offense, but this entire conference\nis an unbelievable monument\nto our capacity to get stuff wrong.\nWe just spent an entire week\ntalking about innovations and advancements\nand improvements,\nbut you know why we need all of those innovations\nand advancements and improvements?\nBecause half the stuff\nthat's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --\nTED 1998 --\neh.\n(Laughter)\nDidn't really work out that way, did it?\n(Laughter)\nWhere's my jet pack, Chris?"

S"\nThis is the Large Hadron Collider.\nIt's 27 kilometers in circumference.\nIt's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.\nOver 10,000 physicists and engineers\nfrom 85 countries around the world\nhave come together over several decades\nto build this machine.\nWhat we do is we accelerate protons --\nso, hydrogen nuclei --\naround 99.999999\npercent the speed of light.\nRight? At that speed, they go around\nthat 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.\nAnd we collide them with another beam of protons\ngoing in the opposite direction.\nWe collide them inside giant detectors."
p3874
aS"\nThey're essentially digital cameras.\nAnd this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.\nYou get some sense of the size --\nyou can just see these EU standard-size\npeople underneath."

p3876

p3877
aS"\nAnd actually, this morning, I got an email\nsaying that we've just finished, today,\nbuilding the last piece of ATLAS.\nSo as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say\nthat I planned that for TED,\nbut I didn't. So it's been completed as of today."
p3878
aS'\n(Applause)'
p3879
aS'\nYeah, it\'s a wonderful achievement.\nSo, you might be asking, "Why?\nWhy create the conditions that were present\nless than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"\nWell, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.\nAnd the aim of particle physics is to understand\nwhat everything\'s made of, and how everything sticks together.\nAnd by everything I mean, of course,\nme and you, the Earth, the Sun,\nthe 100 billion suns in our galaxy\nand the 100 billion galaxies\nin the observable universe.\nAbsolutely everything.'
p3880
aS'\nNow you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?\nYou know? If you want to know what I\'m made of, let\'s look at me."\nWell, we found that as you look back in time,\nthe universe gets hotter and hotter,\ndenser and denser, and simpler and simpler.\nNow, there\'s no real reason I\'m aware of for that,\nbut that seems to be the case.\nSo, way back in the early times of the universe,\nwe believe it was very simple and understandable.\nAll this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --\nhuman brains -- are a property of an old\nand cold and complicated universe.\nBack at the start, in the first billionth of a second,\nwe believe, or we\'ve observed, it was very simple.'
p3881
aS"\nIt's almost like ...\nimagine a snowflake in your hand,\nand you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,\nbeautiful object. But as you heat it up,\nit'll melt into a pool of water,\nand you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made\nof H20, water.\nSo it's in that same sense that we look back in time\nto understand what the universe is made of.\nAnd, as of today, it's made of these things.\nJust 12 particles of matter,\nstuck together by four forces of nature.\nThe quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons\nthat make up the atomic nuclei in your body.\nThe electron -- the thing that goes around\nthe atomic nucleus --\nheld around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force\nthat's carried by this thing, the photon.\nThe quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons."
p3882
aS"\nAnd these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,\nprobably the least familiar.\nBut, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.\nAnd when the sun shines, you get copious quantities\nof these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.\nActually, if you just look at your thumbnail --\nabout a square centimeter --\nthere are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second\nfrom the sun, passing\nthrough every square centimeter of your body.\nBut you don't feel them, because the weak force\nis correctly named --\nvery short range and very weak,\nso they just fly through you."
p3883
aS"\nAnd these particles have been discovered\nover the last century, pretty much.\nThe first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,\nand the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,\nin the year 2000. Actually just --\nI was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,\nAmerica, isn't it?\nJust up the road.\nRelative to the universe, it's just up the road."
p3884
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3885
aS"\nSo, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,\nso it's a relatively recent picture.\nOne of the wonderful things, actually, I find,\nis that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.\nYou know, they're a step in size\nfrom the entire observable universe.\nSo, 100 billion galaxies,\n13.7 billion light years away --\na step in size from that to Monterey, actually,\nis about the same as from Monterey to these things.\nAbsolutely, exquisitely minute,\nand yet we've discovered pretty much the full set."
p3886
aS'\nSo, one of my most illustrious forebears\nat Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,\ndiscoverer of the atomic nucleus,\nonce said, "All science is either physics\nor stamp collecting."\nNow, I don\'t think he meant to insult\nthe rest of science,\nalthough he was from New Zealand, so it\'s possible.'
p3887
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3888
aS"\nBut what he meant was that what we've done, really,\nis stamp collect there.\nOK, we've discovered the particles,\nbut unless you understand the underlying\nreason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --\nreally you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.\nFortunately, we have\nprobably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century\nthat underpins that pattern.\nIt's the Newton's laws, if you want,\nof particle physics.\nIt's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.\nYou could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,\nwhich is always the sign of elegance.\nThis is it."
p3889
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p3890
aS"\nI've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out\nin all its gory detail.\nThis equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --\nother than gravity -- that happens in the universe.\nSo, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --\nin principle, you've got a big enough computer --\nwhy DNA is the shape it is.\nIn principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation."
p3891
aS"\nBut there's a problem.\nCan anyone see what it is?\nA bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.\nI'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.\nBasically, each of these terms\nrefers to some of the particles.\nSo those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.\nThese carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.\nBut there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.\nRight, H.\nH stands for Higgs particle.\nHiggs particles have not been discovered.\nBut they're necessary: they're necessary\nto make that mathematics work.\nSo all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do\nwith that wonderful equation\nwouldn't be possible without an extra bit.\nSo it's a prediction:\na prediction of a new particle."
p3892
aS'\nWhat does it do?\nWell, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.\nAnd back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money\nfor the LHC from the U.K. government,\nMargaret Thatcher, at the time, said,\n"If you guys can explain, in language\na politician can understand,\nwhat the hell it is that you\'re doing, you can have the money.\nI want to know what this Higgs particle does."\nAnd we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.\nWell, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.\nAnd the picture is that the whole universe --\nand that doesn\'t mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --\nthe whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.\nHiggs particles, if you will.'
p3893
aS"\nThe analogy is that these people in a room\nare the Higgs particles.\nNow when a particle moves through the universe,\nit can interact with these Higgs particles.\nBut imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.\nThen everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,\nessentially at the speed of light. They're massless.\nAnd imagine someone incredibly important\nand popular and intelligent\nwalks into the room.\nThey're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.\nIt's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.\nAnd that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.\nThe picture is that the electrons and the quarks\nin your body and in the universe that we see around us\nare heavy, in a sense, and massive,\nbecause they're surrounded by Higgs particles.\nThey're interacting with the Higgs field."
p3894
aS"\nIf that picture's true,\nthen we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.\nIf it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,\nalthough it's the simplest we've been able to think of --\nthen whatever does the job of the Higgs particles\nwe know have to turn up\nat the LHC.\nSo, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.\nI'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.\nActually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --\n(Laughter)\nanyway.\nSo that's one thing.\nThat's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find."
p3895
aS"\nThere are many other things. You've heard\nmany of the big problems in particle physics.\nOne of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.\nThere's another issue,\nwhich is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --\nseem, as you go back in time,\nthey seem to change in strength.\nWell, they do change in strength.\nSo, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,\ngets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.\nThe strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,\ngets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --\nyou can calculate how these change -- is the forces,\nthe three forces, other than gravity,\nalmost seem to come together at one point.\nIt's almost as if there was one beautiful\nkind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.\nBut they just miss."
p3896
aS"\nNow there's a theory called super-symmetry,\nwhich doubles the number of particles in the standard model,\nwhich, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.\nBut actually, with this theory,\nwe find that the forces of nature\ndo seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --\nabsolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,\nbut it seems to do it.\nAlso, those super-symmetric particles\nare very strong candidates for the dark matter.\nSo a very compelling theory\nthat's really mainstream physics.\nAnd if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --\nin a very unscientific way -- that\nthat these things would also crop up at the LHC.\nMany other things that the LHC could discover."
p3897
aS"\nBut in the last few minutes, I just want to give you\na different perspective\nof what I think -- what particle physics\nreally means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.\nAnd that's that I think it's given us a wonderful\nnarrative -- almost a creation story,\nif you'd like -- about the universe,\nfrom modern science over the last few decades.\nAnd I'd say that it deserves,\nin the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,\nto be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories\nof the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.\nThis is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful."
p3898
aS"\nThe story goes like this: we know that\nthe universe began 13.7 billion years ago,\nin an immensely hot, dense state,\nmuch smaller than a single atom.\nIt began to expand about\na million, billion, billion, billion billionth\nof a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.\nGravity separated away from the other forces.\nThe universe then underwent\nan exponential expansion called inflation.\nIn about the first billionth of a second or so,\nthe Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks\nand the gluons and the electrons\nthat make us up got mass.\nThe universe continued to expand and cool.\nAfter about a few minutes,\nthere was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.\nThe universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,\n25 percent helium. It still is today."
p3899
aS"\nIt continued to expand\nabout 300 million years.\nThen light began to travel through the universe.\nIt was big enough to be transparent to light,\nand that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background\nthat George Smoot described\nas looking at the face of God.\nAfter about 400 million years, the first stars formed,\nand that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook\ninto the heavier elements.\nSo the elements of life --\ncarbon, and oxygen and iron,\nall the elements that we need to make us up --\nwere cooked in those first generations of stars,\nwhich then ran out of fuel, exploded,\nthrew those elements back into the universe.\nThey then re-collapsed into another generation\nof stars and planets."
p3900
aS'\nAnd on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created\nin that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen\nto form water, liquid water on the surface.\nOn at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,\nprimitive life evolved,\nwhich evolved over millions of years into\nthings that walked upright and left footprints\nabout three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,\nand eventually\nleft a footprint on another world.\nAnd built this civilization,\nthis wonderful picture,\nthat turned the darkness into light,\nand you can see the civilization from space.\nAs one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,\nthese are the things -- and actually, not only these,\nbut I was looking around -- these are the things,\nlike Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,\nand DNA, and literature and science --\nthese are the things that hydrogen atoms do\nwhen given 13.7 billion years.'
p3901
aS"\nAbsolutely remarkable.\nAnd, the laws of physics. Right?\nSo, the right laws of physics --\nthey're beautifully balanced.\nIf the weak force had been a little bit different,\nthen carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable\ninside the hearts of stars,\nand there would be none of that in the universe.\nAnd I think that's\na wonderful and significant story.\n50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,\nbecause we didn't know it.\nIt makes me really feel that\nthat civilization --\nwhich, as I say, if you believe\nthe scientific creation story,\nhas emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,\nand a few hydrogen atoms --\nthen I think, to me anyway,\nit makes me feel incredibly valuable."

p3906
aS'\nOn that day, a column of American\nand Afghan troops\nwere making their way\nthrough a part of Afghanistan\nto help protect\na group of government officials,\na group of Afghan government officials,\nwho would be meeting with some local\nvillage elders.\nThe column came under ambush,\nand was surrounded on three sides,\nand amongst many other things,\nCaptain Swenson was recognized\nfor running into live fire\nto rescue the wounded\nand pull out the dead.\nOne of the people he rescued was a sergeant,\nand he and a comrade were making their way\nto a medevac helicopter.'
p3907
aS'\nAnd what was remarkable about this day\nis, by sheer coincidence,\none of the medevac medics\nhappened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet\nand captured the whole scene on camera.\nIt shows Captain Swenson and his comrade\nbringing this wounded soldier\nwho had received a gunshot to the neck.\nThey put him in the helicopter,\nand then you see Captain Swenson bend over\nand give him a kiss\nbefore he turns around to rescue more.'
p3908
aS'\nI saw this, and I thought to myself,\nwhere do people like that come from?\nWhat is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,\nwhen you would want to do that.\nThere\'s a love there,\nand I wanted to know why is it that\nI don\'t have people that I work with like that?\nYou know, in the military, they give medals\nto people who are willing to sacrifice themselves\nso that others may gain.\nIn business, we give bonuses to people\nwho are willing to sacrifice others\nso that we may gain.\nWe have it backwards. Right?\nSo I asked myself, where do\npeople like this come from?\nAnd my initial conclusion was\nthat they\'re just better people.\nThat\'s why they\'re attracted to the military.\nThese better people are attracted\nto this concept of service.\nBut that\'s completely wrong.\nWhat I learned was that it\'s the environment,\nand if you get the environment right,\nevery single one of us has the capacity\nto do these remarkable things,\nand more importantly, others have that capacity too.\nI\'ve had the great honor of getting to meet\nsome of these, who we would call heroes,\nwho have put themselves and put their lives\nat risk to save others,\nand I asked them, "Why would you do it?\nWhy did you do it?"\nAnd they all say the same thing:\n"Because they would have done it for me."\nIt\'s this deep sense of trust and cooperation.\nSo trust and cooperation are really important here.\nThe problem with concepts of trust and cooperation\nis that they are feelings, they are not instructions.\nI can\'t simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.\nI can\'t simply instruct two people \nto cooperate, and they will.\nIt\'s not how it works. It\'s a feeling.'
p3909
aS"\nSo where does that feeling come from?\nIf you go back 50,000 years\nto the Paleolithic era,\nto the early days of Homo sapiens,\nwhat we find is that the world\nwas filled with danger,\nall of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.\nNothing personal.\nWhether it was the weather,\nlack of resources,\nmaybe a saber-toothed tiger,\nall of these things working\nto reduce our lifespan.\nAnd so we evolved into social animals,\nwhere we lived together and worked together\nin what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,\nwhere we felt like we belonged.\nAnd when we felt safe amongst our own,\nthe natural reaction was trust and cooperation.\nThere are inherent benefits to this.\nIt means I can fall asleep at night\nand trust that someone from within\nmy tribe will watch for danger.\nIf we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,\nthat means you won't watch for danger.\nBad system of survival."
p3910
aS"\nThe modern day is exactly the same thing.\nThe world is filled with danger,\nthings that are trying to frustrate our lives\nor reduce our success,\nreduce our opportunity for success.\nIt could be the ups and downs in the economy,\nthe uncertainty of the stock market.\nIt could be a new technology that renders\nyour business model obsolete overnight.\nOr it could be your competition\nthat is sometimes trying to kill you.\nIt's sometimes trying to put you out of business,\nbut at the very minimum\nis working hard to frustrate your growth\nand steal your business from you.\nWe have no control over these forces.\nThese are a constant,\nand they're not going away."
p3911
aS"\nThe only variable are the conditions\ninside the organization,\nand that's where leadership matters,\nbecause it's the leader that sets the tone.\nWhen a leader makes the choice\nto put the safety and lives\nof the people inside the organization first,\nto sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice\nthe tangible results, so that the people remain\nand feel safe and feel like they belong,\nremarkable things happen."
p3912
aS'\nI was flying on a trip,\nand I was witness to an incident\nwhere a passenger attempted to board\nbefore their number was called,\nand I watched the gate agent\ntreat this man like he had broken the law,\nlike a criminal.\nHe was yelled at for attempting to board\none group too soon.\nSo I said something.\nI said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?\nWhy can\'t you treat us like human beings?"\nAnd this is exactly what she said to me.\nShe said, "Sir, if I don\'t follow the rules,\nI could get in trouble or lose my job."\nAll she was telling me\nis that she doesn\'t feel safe.\nAll she was telling me is that\nshe doesn\'t trust her leaders.\nThe reason we like flying Southwest Airlines\nis not because they necessarily hire better people.\nIt\'s because they don\'t fear their leaders.'
p3913
aS'\nYou see, if the conditions are wrong,\nwe are forced to expend our own time and energy\nto protect ourselves from each other,\nand that inherently weakens the organization.\nWhen we feel safe inside the organization,\nwe will naturally combine our talents\nand our strengths and work tirelessly\nto face the dangers outside\nand seize the opportunities.'
p3914
aS'\nThe closest analogy I can give\nto what a great leader is, is like being a parent.\nIf you think about what being a great parent is,\nwhat do you want? What makes a great parent?\nWe want to give our child opportunities,\neducation, discipline them when necessary,\nall so that they can grow up and achieve more\nthan we could for ourselves.\nGreat leaders want exactly the same thing.\nThey want to provide their people opportunity,\neducation, discipline when necessary,\nbuild their self-confidence, give\nthem the opportunity to try and fail,\nall so that they could achieve more\nthan we could ever imagine for ourselves.'

aS"\nThis is the reason so many people\nhave such a visceral hatred, anger,\nat some of these banking CEOs\nwith their disproportionate\nsalaries and bonus structures.\nIt's not the numbers.\nIt's that they have violated the\nvery definition of leadership.\nThey have violated this deep-seated social contract.\nWe know that they allowed their people\nto be sacrificed so they could\nprotect their own interests,\nor worse, they sacrificed their people\nto protect their own interests.\nThis is what so offends us, not the numbers.\nWould anybody be offended if we gave\na $150 million bonus to Gandhi?\nHow about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?\nDo we have an issue with that?

S"\nI'm here to share my photography.\nOr is it photography?\nBecause, of course, this is a photograph\nthat you can't take with your camera."
p3969
aS'\nYet, my interest in photography started\nas I got my first digital camera\nat the age of 15.\nIt mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,\nbut it was a bit different,\nbecause using the camera,\nthe process was in the planning instead.\nAnd when you take a photograph with a camera,\nthe process ends when you press the trigger.\nSo to me it felt like photography was more about\nbeing at the right place and the right time.\nI felt like anyone could do that.'
p3970
aS"\nSo I wanted to create something different,\nsomething where the process starts\nwhen you press the trigger.\nPhotos like this:\nconstruction going on along a busy road.\nBut it has an unexpected twist.\nAnd despite that,\nit retains a level of realism.\nOr photos like these --\nboth dark and colorful,\nbut all with a common goal\nof retaining the level of realism.\nWhen I say realism,\nI mean photo-realism.\nBecause, of course,\nit's not something you can capture really,\nbut I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow\nas a photograph.\nPhotos where you will need a brief moment to think\nto figure out the trick.\nSo it's more about capturing an idea\nthan about capturing a moment really."
p3971
aS"\nBut what's the trick\nthat makes it look realistic?\nIs it something about the details\nor the colors?\nIs it something about the light?\nWhat creates the illusion?\nSometimes the perspective is the illusion.\nBut in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world\nand how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.\nIt's not really what is realistic,\nit's what we think looks realistic really."
p3972
aS"\nSo I think the basics\nare quite simple.\nI just see it as a puzzle of reality\nwhere you can take different pieces of reality and put it together\nto create alternate reality.\nAnd let me show you a simple example.\nHere we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,\nsomething we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.\nBut combined in a certain way,\nthey can create something that still looks three-dimensional,\nlike it could exist.\nBut at the same time, we know it can't.\nSo we trick our brains,\nbecause our brain simply doesn't accept the fact\nthat it doesn't really make sense.\nAnd I see the same process\nwith combining photographs.\nIt's just really about combining different realities."
p3973
aS"\nSo the things that make a photograph look realistic,\nI think it's the things that we don't even think about,\nthe things all around us in our daily lives.\nBut when combining photographs,\nthis is really important to consider,\nbecause otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.\nSo I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow\nto achieve a realistic result.\nAs you can see, these images aren't really special.\nBut combined, they can create something like this."
p3974
aS'\nSo the first rule is that photos combined\nshould have the same perspective.\nSecondly, photos combined\nshould have the same type of light.\nAnd these two images both fulfill these two requirements --\nshot at the same height and in the same type of light.\nThe third one is about making it impossible to distinguish\nwhere the different images begin and end\nby making it seamless.\nMake it impossible to say\nhow the image actually was composed.\nSo by matching color, contrast and brightness\nin the borders between the different images,\nadding photographic defects\nlike depth of field,\ndesaturated colors and noise,\nwe erase the borders between the different images\nand make it look like one single image,\ndespite the fact that one image\ncan contain hundreds of layers basically.'

aS"\nSo here's another example.\n(Laughter)\nOne might think that this is just an image of a landscape\nand the lower part is what's manipulated.\nBut this image is actually entirely composed\nof photographs from different locations.\nI personally think that it's easier to actually create a place\nthan to find a place,\nbecause then you don't need to compromise\nwith the ideas in your head.\nBut it does require a lot of planning.\nAnd getting this idea during winter,\nI knew that I had several months to plan it,\nto find the different locations\nfor the pieces of the puzzle basically.\nSo for example,\nthe fish was captured on a fishing trip.\nThe shores are from a different location.\nThe underwater part was captured in a stone pit.\nAnd yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red\nto make it look more Swedish."
p3976
aS"\nSo to achieve a realistic result,\nI think it comes down to planning.\nIt always starts with a sketch, an idea.\nThen it's about combining the different photographs.\nAnd here every piece is very well planned.\nAnd if you do a good job capturing the photos,\nthe result can be quite beautiful\nand also quite realistic.\nSo all the tools are out there,\nand the only thing that limits us\nis our imagination."

S'\nEverybody talks about happiness these days.\nI had somebody count the number of books\nwith "happiness" in the title published in the last five years\nand they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.\nThere is a huge wave of interest in happiness,\namong researchers.\nThere is a lot of happiness coaching.\nEverybody would like to make people happier.\nBut in spite of all this flood of work,\nthere are several cognitive traps\nthat sort of make it almost impossible to think straight\nabout happiness.'
p3981
aS'\nAnd my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.\nThis applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,\nand it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,\nbecause it turns out we\'re just as messed up as anybody else is.\nThe first of these traps\nis a reluctance to admit complexity.\nIt turns out that the word "happiness"\nis just not a useful word anymore,\nbecause we apply it to too many different things.\nI think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,\nbut by and large,\nthis is something that we\'ll have to give up\nand we\'ll have to adopt the more complicated view\nof what well-being is.\nThe second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;\nbasically, it\'s between being happy in your life,\nand being happy about your life\nor happy with your life.\nAnd those are two very different concepts,\nand they\'re both lumped in the notion of happiness.\nAnd the third is the focusing illusion,\nand it\'s the unfortunate fact that we can\'t think about any circumstance\nthat affects well-being\nwithout distorting its importance.\nI mean, this is a real cognitive trap.\nThere\'s just no way of getting it right.'
p3982
aS"\nNow, I'd like to start with an example\nof somebody who had a question-and-answer session\nafter one of my lectures reported a story,\nand that was a story --\nHe said he'd been listening to a symphony,\nand it was absolutely glorious music\nand at the very end of the recording,\nthere was a dreadful screeching sound.\nAnd then he added, really quite emotionally,\nit ruined the whole experience.\nBut it hadn't.\nWhat it had ruined were the memories of the experience.\nHe had had the experience.\nHe had had 20 minutes of glorious music.\nThey counted for nothing\nbecause he was left with a memory;\nthe memory was ruined,\nand the memory was all that he had gotten to keep."
p3983
aS'\nWhat this is telling us, really,\nis that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people\nin terms of two selves.\nThere is an experiencing self,\nwho lives in the present\nand knows the present,\nis capable of re-living the past,\nbut basically it has only the present.\nIt\'s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --\nyou know, when the doctor asks,\n"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"\nAnd then there is a remembering self,\nand the remembering self is the one that keeps score,\nand maintains the story of our life,\nand it\'s the one that the doctor approaches\nin asking the question,\n"How have you been feeling lately?"\nor "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.\nThose are two very different entities,\nthe experiencing self and the remembering self,\nand getting confused between them is part of the mess\nabout the notion of happiness.'
p3984
aS'\nNow, the remembering self\nis a storyteller.\nAnd that really starts with a basic response of our memories --\nit starts immediately.\nWe don\'t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.\nOur memory tells us stories,\nthat is, what we get to keep from our experiences\nis a story.\nAnd let me begin with one example.\nThis is an old study.\nThose are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.\nI won\'t go into detail. It\'s no longer painful these days,\nbut it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.\nThey were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.\nHere are two patients,\nthose are their recordings.\nAnd you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"\nAnd it\'s a very easy question.\nClearly, Patient B suffered more --\nhis colonoscopy was longer,\nand every minute of pain that Patient A had,\nPatient B had, and more.'
p3985
aS'\nBut now there is another question:\n"How much did these patients think they suffered?"\nAnd here is a surprise.\nThe surprise is that Patient A\nhad a much worse memory of the colonoscopy\nthan Patient B.\nThe stories of the colonoscopies were different,\nand because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.\nAnd neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --\nbut one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)\nbut one of them is distinctly worse than the other.\nAnd the one that is worse\nis the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;\nit\'s a bad story.\nHow do we know that?\nBecause we asked these people after their colonoscopy,\nand much later, too,\n"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"\nAnd it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.'
p3986
aS"\nNow this is a direct conflict\nbetween the experiencing self and the remembering self.\nFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,\nclearly, B had a worse time.\nNow, what you could do with Patient A,\nand we actually ran clinical experiments,\nand it has been done, and it does work --\nyou could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A\nby just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.\nThat will cause the patient\nto suffer, but just a little\nand much less than before.\nAnd if you do that for a couple of minutes,\nyou have made the experiencing self\nof Patient A worse off,\nand you have the remembering self of Patient A\na lot better off,\nbecause now you have endowed Patient A\nwith a better story\nabout his experience.\nWhat defines a story?\nAnd that is true of the stories\nthat memory delivers for us,\nand it's also true of the stories that we make up.\nWhat defines a story are changes,\nsignificant moments and endings.\nEndings are very, very important\nand, in this case, the ending dominated."
p3987
aS"\nNow, the experiencing self\nlives its life continuously.\nIt has moments of experience, one after the other.\nAnd you can ask: What happens to these moments?\nAnd the answer is really straightforward:\nThey are lost forever.\nI mean, most of the moments of our life --\nand I calculated, you know, the psychological present\nis said to be about three seconds long;\nthat means that, you know,\nin a life there are about 600 million of them;\nin a month, there are about 600,000 --\nmost of them don't leave a trace.\nMost of them are completely ignored\nby the remembering self.\nAnd yet, somehow you get the sense\nthat they should count,\nthat what happens during these moments of experience\nis our life.\nIt's the finite resource that we're spending\nwhile we're on this earth.\nAnd how to spend it\nwould seem to be relevant,\nbut that is not the story\nthat the remembering self keeps for us."
p3988
aS"\nSo we have the remembering self\nand the experiencing self,\nand they're really quite distinct.\nThe biggest difference between them\nis in the handling of time.\nFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,\nif you have a vacation,\nand the second week is just as good as the first,\nthen the two-week vacation\nis twice as good as the one-week vacation.\nThat's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.\nFor the remembering self, a two-week vacation\nis barely better than the one-week vacation\nbecause there are no new memories added.\nYou have not changed the story.\nAnd in this way,\ntime is actually the critical variable\nthat distinguishes a remembering self\nfrom an experiencing self;\ntime has very little impact on the story."
p3989
aS"\nNow, the remembering self does more\nthan remember and tell stories.\nIt is actually the one that makes decisions\nbecause, if you have a patient who has had, say,\ntwo colonoscopies with two different surgeons\nand is deciding which of them to choose,\nthen the one that chooses\nis the one that has the memory that is less bad,\nand that's the surgeon that will be chosen.\nThe experiencing self\nhas no voice in this choice.\nWe actually don't choose between experiences,\nwe choose between memories of experiences.\nAnd even when we think about the future,\nwe don't think of our future normally as experiences.\nWe think of our future\nas anticipated memories.\nAnd basically you can look at this,\nyou know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,\nand you can think of the remembering self\nsort of dragging the experiencing self\nthrough experiences that\nthe experiencing self doesn't need."
p3990
aS"\nI have that sense that\nwhen we go on vacations\nthis is very frequently the case;\nthat is, we go on vacations,\nto a very large extent,\nin the service of our remembering self.\nAnd this is a bit hard to justify I think.\nI mean, how much do we consume our memories?\nThat is one of the explanations\nthat is given for the dominance\nof the remembering self.\nAnd when I think about that, I think about a vacation\nwe had in Antarctica a few years ago,\nwhich was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,\nand I think of it relatively often,\nrelative to how much I think of other vacations.\nAnd I probably have consumed\nmy memories of that three-week trip, I would say,\nfor about 25 minutes in the last four years.\nNow, if I had ever opened the folder\nwith the 600 pictures in it,\nI would have spent another hour.\nNow, that is three weeks,\nand that is at most an hour and a half.\nThere seems to be a discrepancy.\nNow, I may be a bit extreme, you know,\nin how little appetite I have for consuming memories,\nbut even if you do more of this,\nthere is a genuine question:\nWhy do we put so much weight on memory\nrelative to the weight that we put on experiences?"
p3991
aS"\nSo I want you to think\nabout a thought experiment.\nImagine that for your next vacation,\nyou know that at the end of the vacation\nall your pictures will be destroyed,\nand you'll get an amnesic drug\nso that you won't remember anything.\nNow, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)\nAnd if you would choose a different vacation,\nthere is a conflict between your two selves,\nand you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,\nand it's actually not at all obvious, because\nif you think in terms of time,\nthen you get one answer,\nand if you think in terms of memories,\nyou might get another answer.\nWhy do we pick the vacations we do\nis a problem that confronts us\nwith a choice between the two selves."
p3992
aS"\nNow, the two selves\nbring up two notions of happiness.\nThere are really two concepts of happiness\nthat we can apply, one per self.\nSo you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?\nAnd then you would ask: How happy are the moments\nin the experiencing self's life?\nAnd they're all -- happiness for moments\nis a fairly complicated process.\nWhat are the emotions that can be measured?\nAnd, by the way, now we are capable\nof getting a pretty good idea\nof the happiness of the experiencing self over time.\nIf you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,\nit's a completely different thing.\nThis is not about how happily a person lives.\nIt is about how satisfied or pleased the person is\nwhen that person thinks about her life.\nVery different notion.\nAnyone who doesn't distinguish those notions\nis going to mess up the study of happiness,\nand I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,\nwho've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time\nin precisely this way."
p3993
aS'\nThe distinction between the\nhappiness of the experiencing self\nand the satisfaction of the remembering self\nhas been recognized in recent years,\nand there are now efforts to measure the two separately.\nThe Gallup Organization has a world poll\nwhere more than half a million people\nhave been asked questions\nabout what they think of their life\nand about their experiences,\nand there have been other efforts along those lines.\nSo in recent years, we have begun to learn\nabout the happiness of the two selves.\nAnd the main lesson I think that we have learned\nis they are really different.\nYou can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,\nand that really doesn\'t teach you much\nabout how happily they\'re living their life,\nand vice versa.\nJust to give you a sense of the correlation,\nthe correlation is about .5.\nWhat that means is if you met somebody,\nand you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"\nhow much would you know about his height?\nWell, you would know something about his height,\nbut there\'s a lot of uncertainty.\nYou have that much uncertainty.\nIf I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,\nyou have a lot of uncertainty\nabout how happy they are\nwith their experiencing self.\nSo the correlation is low.'
p3994
aS"\nWe know something about what controls\nsatisfaction of the happiness self.\nWe know that money is very important,\ngoals are very important.\nWe know that happiness is mainly\nbeing satisfied with people that we like,\nspending time with people that we like.\nThere are other pleasures, but this is dominant.\nSo if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,\nyou are going to end up\ndoing very different things.\nThe bottom line of what I've said here\nis that we really should not think of happiness\nas a substitute for well-being.\nIt is a completely different notion."
p3995
aS"\nNow, very quickly,\nanother reason we cannot think straight about happiness\nis that we do not attend to the same things\nwhen we think about life, and we actually live.\nSo, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,\nyou are not going to get to the correct answer.\nWhen you ask that question,\nyou think people must be happier in California\nif, say, you live in Ohio.\n(Laughter)\nAnd what happens is\nwhen you think about living in California,\nyou are thinking of the contrast\nbetween California and other places,\nand that contrast, say, is in climate.\nWell, it turns out that climate\nis not very important to the experiencing self\nand it's not even very important to the reflective self\nthat decides how happy people are.\nBut now, because the reflective self is in charge,\nyou may end up -- some people may end up\nmoving to California.\nAnd it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen\nto people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.\nWell, their experiencing self\nis not going to get happier.\nWe know that.\nBut one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,\nbecause, when they think about it,\nthey'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,\nand they will feel they made the right decision."
p3996
aS'\nIt is very difficult\nto think straight about well-being,\nand I hope I have given you a sense\nof how difficult it is.'

aS"\nDaniel Kahneman: Sure.\nI think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey\nis a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.\nWe found that with respect to the happiness\nof the experiencing self.\nWhen we looked at how feelings,\nvary with income.\nAnd it turns out that, below an income\nof 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --\nand that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,\nso it's a large representative sample --\nbelow an income of 600,000 dollars a year..."
p4001
aS'\nCA: 60,000.'
p4002
aS"\nDK: 60,000.\n(Laughter)\n60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,\nand they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.\nAbove that, we get an absolutely flat line.\nI mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.\nClearly, what is happening is\nmoney does not buy you experiential happiness,\nbut lack of money certainly buys you misery,\nand we can measure that misery\nvery, very clearly.\nIn terms of the other self, the remembering self,\nyou get a different story.\nThe more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.\nThat does not hold for emotions."
p4003
aS'\nCA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about\nlife, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.\nIf people took seriously that finding,\nI mean, it seems to turn upside down\neverything we believe about, like for example,\ntaxation policy and so forth.\nIs there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,\nwould take a finding like that seriously\nand run public policy based on it?'
p4004
aS"\nDK: You know I think that there is recognition\nof the role of happiness research in public policy.\nThe recognition is going to be slow in the United States,\nno question about that,\nbut in the U.K., it is happening,\nand in other countries it is happening.\nPeople are recognizing that they ought\nto be thinking of happiness\nwhen they think of public policy.\nIt's going to take a while,\nand people are going to debate\nwhether they want to study experience happiness,\nor whether they want to study life evaluation,\nso we need to have that debate fairly soon.\nHow to enhance happiness\ngoes very different ways depending on how you think,\nand whether you think of the remembering self\nor you think of the experiencing self.\nThis is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.\nIn the United States, efforts are being made\nto measure the experience happiness of the population.\nThis is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,\npart of national statistics."
p4005

S"\nIt's the fifth time I stand on this shore,\nthe Cuban shore,\nlooking out at that distant horizon,\nbelieving, again,\nthat I'm going to make it\nall the way across that vast,\ndangerous wilderness of an ocean.\nNot only have I tried four times,\nbut the greatest swimmers in the world\nhave been trying since 1950,\nand it's still never been done."

aS"\nThe team is proud of our four attempts.\nIt's an expedition of some 30 people.\nBonnie is my best friend and head handler,\nwho somehow summons will,\nthat last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone,\nafter many, many hours and days out there.\nThe shark experts are the best in the world --\nlarge predators below.\nThe box jellyfish, the deadliest venom\nin all of the ocean, is in these waters,\nand I have come close to dying from them\non a previous attempt.\nThe conditions themselves,\nbesides the sheer distance of over 100 miles\nin the open ocean --\nthe currents and whirling eddies\nand the Gulf Stream itself, the most unpredictable\nof all of the planet Earth."
p4009
aS'\nAnd by the way, it\'s amusing to me that\njournalists and people before these attempts\noften ask me,\n"Well, are you going to go with any boats\nor any people or anything?"\nAnd I\'m thinking, what are they imagining?\nThat I\'ll just sort of do some celestial navigation,\nand carry a bowie knife in my mouth,\nand I\'ll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them,\nand maybe drag a desalinization plant\nbehind me for fresh water.\n(Laughter)'
p4010
aS'\nYes, I have a team. (Laughter)\nAnd the team is expert, and the team is courageous,\nand brimming with innovation\nand scientific discovery,\nas is true with any major expedition on the planet.'
p4011
aS'\nAnd we\'ve been on a journey.\nAnd the debate has raged, hasn\'t it,\nsince the Greeks,\nof isn\'t it what it\'s all about?\nIsn\'t life about the journey,\nnot really the destination?\nAnd here we\'ve been on this journey,\nand the truth is, it\'s been thrilling.\nWe haven\'t reached that other shore,\nand still our sense of pride and commitment,\nunwavering commitment.\nWhen I turned 60, the dream was still alive\nfrom having tried this in my 20s,\nand dreamed it and imagined it.\nThe most famous body of water\non the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida.\nAnd it was deep. It was deep in my soul.\nAnd when I turned 60,\nit wasn\'t so much about the athletic accomplishment,\nit wasn\'t the ego of "I want to be the first."\nThat\'s always there and it\'s undeniable.\nBut it was deeper. It was, how much life is there left?\nLet\'s face it, we\'re all on a one-way street, aren\'t we,\nand what are we going to do?\nWhat are we going to do as we go forward\nto have no regrets looking back?\nAnd all this past year in training,\nI had that Teddy Roosevelt quote\nto paraphrase it, floating around in my brain,\nand it says, "You go ahead,\nyou go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair\nand you be the critic, you be the observer,\nwhile the brave one gets in the ring and engages\nand gets bloody and gets dirty and fails\nover and over and over again,\nbut yet isn\'t afraid and isn\'t timid\nand lives life in a bold way."'
p4012
aS'\nAnd so of course I want to make it across.\nIt is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say\nthat this year, the destination was even sweeter\nthan the journey.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nBut the journey itself was worthwhile taking.\nAnd at this point, by this summer,\neverybody -- scientists, sports scientists,\nendurance experts, neurologists,\nmy own team, Bonnie --\nsaid it\'s impossible.\nIt just simply can\'t be done, and Bonnie said to me,\n"But if you\'re going to take the journey,\nI\'m going to see you through to the end of it,\nso I\'ll be there."'
p4013
aS'\nAnd now we\'re there.\nAnd as we\'re looking out, kind of a surreal moment\nbefore the first stroke,\nstanding on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,\nthe Cuban flag is flying above,\nall my team\'s out in their boats,\nhands up in the air, "We\'re here, we\'re here for you,"\nBonnie and I look at each other, and we say,\nthis year, the mantra is --\nand I\'ve been using it in training --\nfind a way.\nYou have a dream\nand you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.\nNone of us ever get through this life\nwithout heartache,\nwithout turmoil,\nand if you believe and you have faith\nand you can get knocked down\nand get back up again\nand you believe in perseverance\nas a great human quality,\nyou find your way, and\nBonnie grabbed my shoulders,\nand she said, "Let\'s find our way to Florida."'
p4014
aS'\nAnd we started, and for the next 53 hours,\nit was an intense, unforgettable life experience.\nThe highs were high, the awe,\nI\'m not a religious person, but I\'ll tell you,\nto be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream\nas if, as you\'re breathing,\nyou\'re looking down miles and miles and miles,\nto feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on,\nit\'s awe-inspiring.\nI have a playlist of about 85 songs,\nand especially in the middle of the night,\nand that night, because we use no lights --\nlights attract jellyfish, lights attract sharks,\nlights attract baitfish that attract sharks,\nso we go in the pitch black of the night.\nYou\'ve never seen black this black.\nYou can\'t see the front of your hand,\nand the people on the boat,\nBonnie and my team on the boat,\nthey just hear the slapping of the arms,\nand they know where I am,\nbecause there\'s no visual at all.\nAnd I\'m out there kind of tripping out\non my little playlist.\n(Laughter)\nI\'ve got a tight rubber cap,\nso I don\'t hear a thing.\nI\'ve got goggles and I\'m turning\nmy head 50 times a minute,\nand I\'m singing,\n Imagine there\'s no heaven \n doo doo doo doo doo \n It\'s easy if you try \n doo doo doo doo doo \nAnd I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.\n(Laughter)\nNow there\'s a talent unto itself.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nAnd each time I get done with\n Ooh, you may say I\'m a dreamer\nbut I\'m not the only one \n222.\n Imagine there\'s no heaven \nAnd when I get through the end of a thousand\nof John Lennon\'s "Imagine,"\nI have swum nine hours and 45 minutes,\nexactly.'
p4015
aS'\nAnd then there are the crises. Of course there are.\nAnd the vomiting starts,\nthe seawater, you\'re not well,\nyou\'re wearing a jellyfish mask\nfor the ultimate protection.\nIt\'s difficult to swim in.\nIt\'s causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth,\nbut the tentacles can\'t get you.\nAnd the hypothermia sets in.\nThe water\'s 85 degrees, and yet you\'re losing weight\nand using calories, and as you come over\ntoward the side of the boat, not allowed to touch it,\nnot allowed to get out,\nbut Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition\nand asks me what I\'m doing, am I all right,\nI am seeing the Taj Mahal over here.\nI\'m in a very different state,\nand I\'m thinking, wow, I never thought\nI\'d be running into the Taj Mahal out here.\nIt\'s gorgeous.\nI mean, how long did it take them to build that?\nIt\'s just -- So, uh, wooo. (Laughter)\nAnd then we kind of have a cardinal rule\nthat I\'m never told, really, how far it is,\nbecause we don\'t know how far it is.\nWhat\'s going to happen to you\nbetween this point and that point?\nWhat\'s going to happen to the weather\nand the currents and, God forbid, you\'re stung\nwhen you don\'t think you could\nbe stung in all this armor,\nand Bonnie made a decision\ncoming into that third morning\nthat I was suffering\nand I was hanging on by a thread\nand she said, "Come here,"\nand I came close to the boat, and she said,\n"Look, look out there,"\nand I saw light, because the\nday\'s easier than the night,\nand I thought we were coming into day,\nand I saw a stream of white light\nalong the horizon,\nand I said, "It\'s going to be morning soon."\nAnd she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."\nIt was 15 more hours,\nwhich for most swimmers would be a long time.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nYou have no idea how many\n15-hour training swims I had done.'
p4016
aS'\nSo here we go, and I somehow, without a decision,\nwent into no counting of strokes\nand no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking\nand the parameters of the universe,\nI just went into thinking about this dream,\nand why, and how.\nAnd as I said, when I turned 60,\nit wasn\'t about that concrete "Can you do it?"\nThat\'s the everyday machinations.\nThat\'s the discipline, and it\'s the preparation,\nand there\'s a pride in that.\nBut I decided to think, as I went along, about,\nthe phrase usually is reaching for the stars,\nand in my case, it\'s reaching for the horizon.\nAnd when you reach for the horizon,\nas I\'ve proven, you may not get there,\nbut what a tremendous build of character and spirit\nthat you lay down.\nWhat a foundation you lay down in reaching\nfor those horizons.'
p4017
aS"\nAnd now the shore is coming,\nand there's just a little part of me that's sad.\nThe epic journey is going to be over."
p4018
aS'\nSo many people come up to me now and say,\n"What\'s next? We love that!\nThat little tracker that was on the computer?\nWhen are you going to do the next one?\nWe just can\'t wait to follow the next one."\nWell, they were just there for 53 hours,\nand I was there for years.\nAnd so there won\'t be another\nepic journey in the ocean.'
p4019
aS'\nBut the point is, and the point was\nthat every day of our lives is epic,\nand I\'ll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach,\nstaggered up onto that beach,\nand I had so many times\nin a very puffed up ego way,\nrehearsed what I would say on the beach.\nWhen Bonnie thought that\nthe back of my throat was swelling up,\nand she brought the medical team over to our boat\nto say that she\'s really beginning\nto have trouble breathing.\nAnother 12, 24 hours in the saltwater,\nthe whole thing -- and I just thought\nin my hallucinatory moment, that\nI heard the word tracheotomy.\n(Laughter)\nAnd Bonnie said to the doctor,\n"I\'m not worried about her not breathing.\nIf she can\'t talk when she gets to the shore,\nshe\'s gonna be pissed off."\n(Laughter)'
p4020
aS"\nBut the truth is, all those orations\nthat I had practiced just to get myself through\nsome training swims as motivation,\nit wasn't like that.\nIt was a very real moment,\nwith that crowd, with my team.\nWe did it.

aS'\nThe second is, "You can chase your dreams\nat any age; you\'re never too old."\nSixty-four, that no one at any age, any gender,\ncould ever do, has done it,\nand there\'s no doubt in my mind\nthat I am at the prime of my life today.\n(Applause)\nYeah.\nThank you.'
p4023
aS'\nAnd the third thing I said on that beach was,\n"It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world,\nand in many ways, of course, it is,\nand in other ways, and the most important ways,\nit\'s a team, and if you think I\'m a badass,\nyou want to meet Bonnie."\n(Laughter)'
p4024
aS"\nBonnie, where are you?\nWhere are you?\nThere's Bonnie Stoll. (Applause)\nMy buddy."
p4025
aS"\nThe Henry David Thoreau quote goes,\nwhen you achieve your dreams, it's\nnot so much what you get\nas who you have become in achieving them.\nAnd yeah, I stand before you now.\nIn the three months since that swim ended,\nI've sat down with Oprah\nand I've been in President Obama's Oval Office.\nI've been invited to speak in front of\nesteemed groups such as yourselves.\nI've signed a wonderful major book contract.\nAll of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.\nI'm proud of it all, but the truth is,\nI'm walking around tall because I am that bold,\nfearless person, and I will be, every day,\nuntil it's time for these days to be done."
p4026
aS'\nThank you very much and enjoy the conference.'
p4027
aS'\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you.\nFind a way! (Applause)'
p4028
aa(lp4029
S"\nThank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor\nto have the opportunity to come to this stage twice. I'm extremely grateful.\nI have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many\nnice comments about what I had to say the other night.\nAnd I say that sincerely, partly because -- (Mock sob) -- I need that! (Laughter)\nPut yourselves in my position!\nI flew on Air Force Two for eight years.\nNow I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!\n(Laughter) (Applause)"
p4030
aS'\nI\'ll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that\'s been like for me.\nIt\'s a true story -- every bit of this is true.\nSoon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) -- White House -- (Laughter) --\nwe were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have\n50 miles east of Nashville --\ndriving ourselves.\nI know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) --\nI looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.\nThere was no motorcade back there.\nYou\'ve heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter)\nThis was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime,\nand we started looking for a place to eat.\nWe were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.\nWe got off the exit, started looking for a -- we found a Shoney\'s restaurant.\nLow-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don\'t know it.\nWe went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,\nmade a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter)\nShe took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us,\nand she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.\nShe said "Yes, that\'s former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper."\nAnd the man said, "He\'s come down a long way, hasn\'t he?" (Laughter)'
p4031
aS'\nThere\'s been kind of a series of epiphanies.\nThe very next day, continuing a totally true story,\nI got on a G-5 to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,\nin the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.\nI began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened\nthe day before in Nashville.\nI told it pretty much the same way I\'ve just shared it with you:\nTipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney\'s, low-cost family restaurant chain,\nwhat the man said -- they laughed.\nI gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.\nI fell asleep on the plane, until during the middle of the night,\nwe landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.\nI woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,\nand I looked and there was a man running across the runway.\nAnd he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,\n"Call Washington! Call Washington!"\nAnd I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic,\nwhat in the world could be wrong in Washington?\nThen I remembered it could be a bunch of things.\n(Laughter)'
p4032
aS'\nBut what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because\none of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech.\nAnd it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America\n-- it was printed in Monterey, I checked. And the story began,\n"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,\n\'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant, named Shoney\'s,\nand we are running it ourselves.\'" (Laughter)\nBefore I could get back to U.S. soil,\nDavid Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on\n-- one of them had me in a big white chef\'s hat,\nTipper was saying, "One more burger, with fries!"\nThree days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner\nand colleague Bill Clinton saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"\n(Laughter)\nWe like to celebrate each other\'s successes in life.'
p4033
aS'\nI was going to talk about information ecology.\nBut I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,\nthat maybe I could talk about that another time. (Applause)'
p4034
aS"\nChris Anderson: It's a deal!"
p4035
aS"\nAl Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on.\nWhat can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with --\nI'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.\nNow, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it.\nI add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it.\nIt's like beachcombing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells.\nJust in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.\nThis is just for the United States of America. Historical average for\nJanuary is 31 degrees. Last month was 39.5 degrees."
p4036
aS"\nNow, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment\n-- I'm kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides,\nand then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.\nBut I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.\nFirst of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming,\nunder business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy\nis the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation:\nit's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong.\nIt's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves.\nBut they are also very effective in deflecting our path."
p4037
aS"\nCars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow,\nbut I want you to put it in perspective.\nIt's an easy, visible target of concern, and it should be,\nbut there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings\nthan from cars and trucks.\nCars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world,\nand so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.\nOther transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks!\nRenewables at the current levels of technological efficiency\ncan make this much difference, and with what Vinod, and John Doerr, and others,\nmany of you here -- a lot of people directly involved in this\n-- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it.\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for\n-- is likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.\nNot quite there yet."
p4038
aS"\nOK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home.\nMost of these expenditures are also profitable.\nInsulation, better design, buy green electricity where you can.\nI mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail.\nFigure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important."
p4039
aS"\nBe a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy,\nbetween things that have a harsh effect or a much less\nharsh effect on the global climate crisis.\nConsider this. Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.\nThose of you who are good at branding,\nI'd love to get your advice and help on\nhow to say this in a way that connects with the most people.\nIt is easier than you think. It really is.\nA lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy.\nIt means: reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make,\nand then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net."
p4040
aS'\nThere is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened,\nwith my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world\non this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a\nconsumer-friendly carbon calculator.\nYou can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,\nand then you will be given options to reduce.\nAnd by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0\nand we will have click-through purchases of offsets.'
p4041
aS"\nNext, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that,\nand it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,\nwhether you are from the technology, or entertainment,\nor design and architecture community.\nInvest sustainably. Majora mentioned this.\nListen, if you have invested money with managers who you\ncompensate on the basis of their annual performance,\ndon't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.\nOver time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested,\nbased on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions.\nA lot more to be said about that."
p4042
aS"\nBecome a catalyst of change. Teach others; learn about it; talk about it.\nThe movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow\nI gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May.\nMany of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.\nConsider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well.\nAnd I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow, re-purposed,\nwith some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach,\nand -- it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together.\nAnd so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer\nfor a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it,\nen masse, in communities all across the country,\nand we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week\nto keep it right on the cutting edge.\nWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,\nposted with tools and limited-use copyrights,\nso that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.\n(Applause)"
p4043
aS"\nWhere did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?\nIt doesn't mean that if you are a Republican that I'm trying to convince you to be a\nDemocrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue,\nand I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active.\nMake our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.\nSupport the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions, global warming pollution,\nand trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,\nit's not a closed system.\nOnce it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,\nthen everybody who's on a board of directors\n-- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?\nOnce it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO\nto get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions\nthat can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this.\nHelp with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.\nWe have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently the\npoliticians do not have permission to do what needs to be done."
p4044
aS'\nAnd in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes\nmediating between wealth and power the way it once did.\nIt\'s now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.\nWe have to buy a lot of those ads.\nLet\'s rebrand global warming, as many of you have suggested.\nI like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"\nbut again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.\nSomebody said the test we\'re facing now, a scientist told me,\nis whether the combination of an opposable thumb\nand a neocortex is a viable combination.\nThat\'s really true. I said the other night, and I\'ll repeat now: this is not a political issue.\nAgain, the Republicans here, this shouldn\'t be partisan.\nYou have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.\nThis is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,\nto bring more coherence to them.\nWe are one.\nThank you very much, I appreciate it.\n(Applause)'
p4045
aa(lp4046
S'\nI wanna start today -- here\'s my thing. Hold on. There I go.\nHey. I wanna start today -- talk about the structure of a polypeptide. (Laughter)\nI get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know,\n"What the hell\'s that island?" You know,\nit\'s usually followed by,\n"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"\n(Laughter)'
p4047
aS'\nWhy so many mysteries? What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?\nAnd I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.\nWhen I talked to the kind rep from TED, and I said,\n"Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"\nHe said, "Don\'t worry about it. Just be profound."\n(Laughter) And I took enormous comfort in that.\nSo thank you, if you\'re here.'
p4048
aS"\nI was trying to think, what do I talk about? It's a good question.\nWhy do I do so much stuff that involves mystery? And I started trying to figure it out.\nAnd I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,\nand I started thinking about my grandfather.\nI loved my grandfather. Harry Kelvin was his name,\nmy mother's father. He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.\nAnd one of the reasons he was amazing:\nAfter World War II he began an electronics company.\nHe started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.\nSo he had this incredible curiosity. As a kid I saw him\ncome over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things.\nAnd he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them, and reveal the inner workings --\nwhich many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.\nBut it's an amazing gift to give a kid.\nTo open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is.\nHe was the ultimate deconstructer, in many ways.\nAnd my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart,\nbut he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,\nlike, you know, printing, like the letter press. I'm obsessed with printing.\nI'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making.\nWhen I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff."
p4049
aS'\nAnd last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.\nI was just looking at it. And I\'m telling you ... (Laughter) It\'s a beautiful thing.\nI swear to God. I mean, when you look at the box, and you sort of see how it works.\nRives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair; he does pop-up books.\nAnd I\'m obsessed with, like, engineering of paper.\nBut like, the scoring of it, the printing of it, where the thing gets glued,\nyou know, the registration marks for the ink. I just love boxes.\nMy grandfather was sort of the guy who, you know,\nkind of got me into all sorts of these things.\nHe would also supply me with tools.\nHe was this amazing encourager -- this patron, sort of, to make stuff.\nAnd he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.\nAnd in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,\nto be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.\nAnd you know, he was so generous; I couldn\'t believe it.\nHe wasn\'t doing it entirely without some manipulation.\nI mean, I would call him, and I\'d be like,\n"Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.\nYou don\'t understand. This is, like, you know, I want to make movies.\nI\'ll get invited to TED one day. This is like -- " (Laughter)'
p4050
aS'\nAnd you know, and my grandmother was the greatest.\nBecause she\'d be like, you know -- she\'d get on the phone.\nShe\'d be like, "Harry, it\'s better than the drugs. He should be doing -- "\nShe was fantastic. (Laughter)\nSo I found myself getting this stuff,\nthanks to her assist, and suddenly, you know,\nI had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old -- this kind of stuff.\nAnd it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.\nHe sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.\nThe thing is, we\'d go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen\'s Magic.\nIt was this great magic store. It was a crappy little building in Midtown,\nbut you\'d be in the elevator, the elevator would open --\nthere\'d be this little, small magic store. You\'d be in the magic store.\nAnd it was just, it was a magical place.\nSo I got all these sort of magic tricks. Oh, here. I\'ll show you.\nThis is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know. Right?\nWhich is good, but now I can\'t move.\nNow, I have to do this, the rest of the thing, like this.\nI\'m like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!" (Laughter)'
p4051
aS"\nAnyway, so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:\nTannen's Mystery Magic Box.\nThe premise behind the mystery magic box was the following:\n15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.\nWhich is a savings. (Laughter)\nNow, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.\nIf you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.\nBut I've had this forever.\nNow, I was looking at this, it was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf,\nand I was thinking, why have I not opened this?\nAnd why have I kept it? Because I'm not a pack rat. I don't keep everything\nbut for some reason I haven't opened this box.\nAnd I felt like there was a key to this, somehow,\nin talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,\nand bored people elsewhere.\nSo I thought, maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it.\nAnd there was this giant question mark. I love the design, for what it's worth,\nof this thing. And I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?"
p4052
aS"\nAnd I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important\n-- to me. It represents my grandfather.\nAm I allowed to cry at TED? Because -- no, I'm not going to cry. But -- (Laughter)\n-- the thing is, that it represents infinite possibility.\nIt represents hope. It represents potential.\nAnd what I love about this box,\nand what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do,\nis I find myself drawn to infinite possibility, that sense of potential.\nAnd I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.\nNow, it's not the most ground-breaking idea,\nbut when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery\nis more important than knowledge, I started getting interested in this."
p4053
aS'\nAnd so I started thinking about "Lost," and the stuff that we do,\nand I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!\nIn how -- in the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I,\nwho created the show with me, we were basically tasked with creating this series\nthat we had very little time to do. We had 11 and a half weeks\nto write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.\nSo it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility -- what could this thing be?\nThere was no time to develop it.\nI\'m sure you\'re all familiar with those people\nwho tell you what you can\'t do and what you should change.\nAnd there was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.\nAnd so we did this show, and for those of you who, you know, who haven\'t seen it,\nor don\'t know it, I can show you this one little clip from the pilot,\njust to show you some stuff that we did.'
p4054
aS'\nClaire: Help! Please help me! Help me! Help me!'
p4055
aS'\nJack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!'
p4056
aS"\nC: I'm having contractions!"
p4057
aS'\nJ: How many months pregnant are you?'
p4058
aS"\nC: I'm only eight months."
p4059
aS'\nJ: And how far apart are they coming?'
p4060
aS"\nC: I don't know. I think it just happened."
p4061
aS'\nMan: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --'
p4062
aS"\nJJA: Now, 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that, we'd have to kill a stuntman.\nWe'd actually -- (Laughter)\nit would be harder. It would take -- Take 2 would be a bitch.\nSo the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.\nAnd part of that was the amazing availability of technology,\nknowing we could do anything. I mean, we could never have done that.\nWe might have been able to write it; we wouldn't have been able to depict it\nlike we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process,\ntechnology is, like, mind-blowingly inspiring to me.\nI realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?\nIt needs to be filled with something fantastic."
p4063
aS'\nI used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I\'d flip through.\nThe romance of the script was amazing to me; it would inspire me.\nI wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of\nspirit and thought and emotion that that script did.\nYou know, I love Apple computers. I\'m obsessed.\nSo the Apple computer -- like those -- the PowerBook -- this computer, right,\nit challenges me. It basically says,\nwhat are you going to write worthy of me? (Laughter)\nI guess I feel this -- I\'m compelled.\nAnd I often am like, you know, dude, today I\'m out. I got nothing. You know? (Laughter)'
p4064
aS'\nSo there\'s that. In terms of the content of it, you look at stories, you think,\nwell, what are stories but mystery boxes?\nThere\'s a fundamental question -- in TV, the first act is called the teaser.\nIt\'s literally the teaser. It\'s the big question.\nSo you\'re drawn into it. Then of course,\nthere\'s another question. And it goes on and on.\nLook at "Star Wars." You got the droids; they meet the mysterious woman.\nWho\'s that? We don\'t know. Mystery box! You know?\nThen you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid, you see the holographic image.\nYou learn, oh, it\'s a message, you know.\nShe wants to, you know, find Obi Wan Kenobi. He\'s her only hope.\nBut who the hell\'s Obi Wan Kenobi? Mystery box!\nSo then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.\nHoly shit! You know -- so it keeps us --\n(Laughter) -- have you guys not seen that?\n(Laughter) It\'s huge! Anyway --'
p4065
aS'\nSo there\'s this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.\nThen there\'s the thing of mystery in terms of imagination --\nthe withholding of information. You know,\ndoing that intentionally is much more engaging.\nWhether it\'s like the shark in "Jaws"\n-- if Spielberg\'s mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked,\nit would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.\nIn "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!\nEven in a movie, like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"\nthey\'re having that date, remember?\nAnd they\'re in the car, and it\'s loud, and so they put the top up.\nThey\'re in there -- you don\'t hear anything they\'re saying! You can\'t hear a word!\nBut it\'s the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don\'t hear it.\nSo to me, there\'s that.'
p4066
aS'\nAnd then, finally, there\'s this idea -- stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit --\nbut the idea of the mystery box.\nMeaning, what you think you\'re getting, then what you\'re really getting.\nAnd it\'s true in so many movies and stories.\nAnd when you look at "E.T.," for example -- "E.T." is this, you know,\nunbelievable movie about what? It\'s about an alien who meets a kid, right?\nWell, it\'s not. "E.T." is about divorce. "E.T." is about a heartbroken,\ndivorce-crippled family, and ultimately, this kid who can\'t find his way.\n"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.\nIt\'s about a guy who\'s on the verge of divorce.\nHe\'s showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.\nThere are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic\nscenes in the history of time, but pretty great scenes.\nThere\'s a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff\nthat you\'re, you know, expecting.'
p4067
aS'\nWhen you look at a movie like "Jaws,"\nthe scene that you expect -- we have the screen?\nThese are the kind of, you know, scenes that you remember and expect from "Jaws."\nAnd she\'s being eaten; there\'s a shark.\nThe thing about "Jaws" is, it\'s really about a guy\nwho is sort of dealing with his place in the world -- with his masculinity,\nwith his family, how he\'s going to, you know, make it work in this new town.\nThis is one of my favorite scenes ever,\nand this is a scene that you wouldn\'t necessarily think of when you think of "Jaws."\nBut it\'s an amazing scene.'
p4068
aS"\nFather: C'mere. Give us a kiss."
p4069
aS'\nSon: Why?'
p4070
aS"\nFather: 'Cause I need it."
p4071
aS'\nJJA: C\'mon. "Why? \'Cause I need it?" Best scene ever, right?\nCome on! So you think of "Jaws" --\nso that\'s the kind of stuff that, like, you know, the investment of character,\nwhich is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?\nIt\'s why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,\nthey\'re ripping off the wrong thing.\nYou\'re not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.\nYou gotta rip off -- you know, if you rip something off -- rip off the character.\nRip off the stuff that matters. I mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.\nBecause ultimately, you know, the mystery box is all of us. So there\'s that.'
p4072
aS'\nThen the distribution. What\'s a bigger mystery box than a movie theater?\nYou know? You go to the theater, you\'re just so excited to see anything.\nThe moment the lights go down is often the best part, you know?\nAnd you\'re full of that amazing --\nthat feeling of excited anticipation.\nAnd often, the movie\'s, like, there and it\'s going, and then something happens\nand you go, "Oh--" and then something else, and you\'re, "Mmm ..."\nNow, when it\'s a great movie, you\'re along for the ride\n\'cause you\'re willing to give yourself to it.'
p4073
aS'\nSo to me, whether it\'s that, whether it\'s a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone --\nit\'s funny, I\'m an -- as I said, Apple fanatic -- and one day, about a year or so ago,\nI was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs\' keynote,\n\'cause I always do. And he came on, he was presenting the video iPod,\nand what was on the enormous iPod behind him?\n"Lost"! I had no idea! And I realized, holy shit, it\'d come full circle.\nLike, the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do,\ninspired by it, to sell technology. I mean, it\'s nuts! (Laughter)'
p4074
aS"\nI was gonna show you a couple of other things I'm gonna skip through.\nI just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.\nThis is something online; I don't know if you've seen it before.\nSix years ago they did this. This is an online thing done by guys\nwho had some visual effects experience. But the point was,\nthat they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had --\neveryone has now.\nWhat I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,\neveryone has access to now.\nYou don't need to have my grandfather, though you wished you had.\nBut I have to tell you -- this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer\n-- the resolution's a little bit low --\nusing Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.\nHe's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood."

aS"\nThe most incredible sort of mystery, I think, is now the question of what comes next.\nBecause it is now democratized. So now, the creation of media is -- it's everywhere.\nThe stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous.\nAnd so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.\nAnd when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have\nbeen silenced, you know -- who have been silenced in the past --\nit's a very exciting thing."

aS'\nI used to say in classes and lectures and stuff,\nto someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing." It\'s free,\nyou know, you don\'t need permission to go write. But now I can say,\n"Go make your movie!" There\'s nothing stopping you\nfrom going out there and getting the technology.\nYou can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf\nthat is either as good, or just as good, as the stuff that\'s being used by the, you know,\nquote unquote "legit people."\nNo community is best served when only the elite have control.\nAnd I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there.'

aS'\nWhen I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects stuff.\nILM did the effects; it was incredible.\nAnd sort of like my dream to be involved.\nAnd there are a couple of sequences in the movie,\nlike these couple of moments I\'ll show you.\nThere\'s that.'
p4078
aS"\nOkay, obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.\nSo my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.\nAnd it's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up. He's drowsy. He's crazy\n-- out of it. And the guy wakes up,\nand he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain\nthat he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do."

aS'\nBad Guy: Good morning.'
p4080
aS'\nJJA: OK, now. When we shot that scene, we were there doing it,\nthe actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan -- sweetheart, great guy\n-- he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom\'s nose, and it was hurting Tom\'s nose.\nAnd I learned this very early on in my career: Don\'t hurt Tom\'s nose. (Laughter)\nThere are three things you don\'t want to do. Number two is: Don\'t hurt Tom\'s nose.\nSo Eddie has this gun -- and he\'s the greatest guy -- he\'s\nthis really sweet English guy. He\'s like, "Sorry, I don\'t want to hurt you."\nI\'m like -- you gotta -- we have to make this look good.\nAnd I realized that we had to do something \'cause it wasn\'t working just as it was.\nAnd I literally, like, thought back to what I would have done using\nthe Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room,\nand I realized that hand didn\'t have to be Eddie Marsan\'s. It could be Tom\'s.\nAnd Tom would know just how hard to push the gun. He wouldn\'t hurt himself.'
p4081
aS"\nSo we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.\nWe put it in Eddie's sleeve,\nand so the hand that you see -- I'll show you again,\nthat's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.\nSo Tom is playing two roles. (Laughter)\nAnd he didn't ask for any more money.\nSo here, here. Watch it again.\nThere he is. He's waking up. He's drowsy, been through a lot.\nTom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand. (Laughter) Anyway.\nSo.\n(Applause)\nThanks.\nSo you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies.\nAnd the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.\nThank you.

S"\nThink of a hard choice you'll face in the near future.\nIt might be between two careers --\nartist and accountant --\nor places to live -- the city or the country --\nor even between two people to marry --\nyou could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita.\nOr it might be a choice about\nwhether to have children,\nto have an ailing parent move in with you,\nto raise your child in a religion\nthat your partner lives by\nbut leaves you cold.\nOr whether to donate your life savings to charity."
p4084
aS"\nChances are, the hard choice you thought of\nwas something big, something momentous,\nsomething that matters to you.\nHard choices seem to be occasions\nfor agonizing, hand-wringing,\nthe gnashing of teeth.\nBut I think we've misunderstood hard choices\nand the role they play in our lives.\nUnderstanding hard choices\nuncovers a hidden power\neach of us possesses."
p4085
aS'\nWhat makes a choice hard is the way\nthe alternatives relate.\nIn any easy choice,\none alternative is better than the other.\nIn a hard choice,\none alternative is better in some ways,\nthe other alternative is better in other ways,\nand neither is better than the other overall.\nYou agonize over whether to stay\nin your current job in the city\nor uproot your life for\nmore challenging work in the country\nbecause staying is better in some ways,\nmoving is better in others,\nand neither is better than the other overall.'
p4086
aS"\nWe shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.\nLet's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.\nYou could have high fiber bran cereal\nor a chocolate donut.\nSuppose what matters in the choice\nis tastiness and healthfulness.\nThe cereal is better for you,\nthe donut tastes way better,\nbut neither is better than the other overall,\na hard choice.\nRealizing that small choices\ncan also be hard\nmay make big hard choices seem less intractable.\nAfter all, we manage to figure \nout what to have for breakfast,\nso maybe we can figure out\nwhether to stay in the city\nor uproot for the new job in the country."
p4087
aS"\nWe also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard\nbecause we are stupid.\nWhen I graduated from college,\nI couldn't decide between two careers,\nphilosophy and law.\nI really loved philosophy.\nThere are amazing things you can learn\nas a philosopher,\nand all from the comfort of an armchair.\nBut I came from a modest immigrant family\nwhere my idea of luxury\nwas having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich\nin my school lunchbox,\nso the thought of spending my whole life\nsitting around in armchairs just thinking,\nwell, that struck me as the height \nof extravagance and frivolity.\nSo I got out my yellow pad,\nI drew a line down the middle,\nand I tried my best to think of the reasons\nfor and against each alternative.\nI remember thinking to myself,\nif only I knew what my life\nin each career would be like.\nIf only God or Netflix would send me a DVD\nof my two possible future careers, I'd be set.\nI'd compare them side by side,\nI'd see that one was better,\nand the choice would be easy."
p4088
aS"\nBut I got no DVD,\nand because I couldn't figure out which was better,\nI did what many of us do in hard choices:\nI took the safest option.\nFear of being an unemployed philosopher\nled me to become a lawyer,\nand as I discovered,\nlawyering didn't quite fit.\nIt wasn't who I was.\nSo now I'm a philosopher,\nand I study hard choices,\nand I can tell you that fear of the unknown,\nwhile a common motivational default\nin dealing with hard choices,\nrests on a misconception of them.\nIt's a mistake to think that in hard choices,\none alternative really is better than the other,\nbut we're too stupid to know which,\nand since we don't know which, we might as well\ntake the least risky option.\nEven taking two alternatives side by side\nwith full information, a choice can still be hard.\nHard choices are hard\nnot because of us or our ignorance;\nthey're hard because there is no best option."
p4089
aS"\nNow, if there's no best option,\nif the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative\nover another,\nthen surely the alternatives must be equally good.\nSo maybe the right thing to say in hard choices\nis that they're between equally good options.\nBut that can't be right.\nIf alternatives are equally good,\nyou should just flip a coin between them,\nand it seems a mistake to think,\nhere's how you should decide between careers,\nplaces to live, people to marry: Flip a coin."
p4090
aS"\nThere's another reason for thinking\nthat hard choices aren't choices\nbetween equally good options.\nSuppose you have a choice between two jobs:\nyou could be an investment banker\nor a graphic artist.\nThere are a variety of things\nthat matter in such a choice,\nlike the excitement of the work,\nachieving financial security,\nhaving time to raise a family, and so on.\nMaybe the artist's career puts you\non the cutting edge of new forms\nof pictorial expression.\nMaybe the banking career\nputs you on the cutting edge\nof new forms of financial manipulation.\nImagine the two jobs however you like\nso that neither is better than the other."
p4091
aS"\nNow suppose we improve one of them a bit.\nSuppose the bank, wooing you,\nadds 500 dollars a month to your salary.\nDoes the extra money now make the banking job\nbetter than the artist one?\nNot necessarily.\nA higher salary makes the banking job\nbetter than it was before,\nbut it might not be enough to make\nbeing a banker better than being an artist.\nBut if an improvement in one of the jobs\ndoesn't make it better than the other,\nthen the two original jobs\ncould not have been equally good.\nIf you start with two things that are equally good,\nand you improve one of them,\nit now must be better than the other.\nThat's not the case with options in hard choices."
p4092
aS"\nSo now we've got a puzzle.\nWe've got two jobs.\nNeither is better than the other,\nnor are they equally good.\nSo how are we supposed to choose?\nSomething seems to have gone wrong here.\nMaybe the choice itself is problematic\nand comparison is impossible.\nBut that can't be right.\nIt's not like we're trying to choose between\ntwo things that can't be compared.\nWe're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all,\nnot the merits of the number nine\nand a plate of fried eggs.\nA comparison of the overall merits of two jobs\nis something we can make,\nand one we often do make."
p4093
aS"\nI think the puzzle arises\nbecause of an unreflective assumption\nwe make about value.\nWe unwittingly assume that values\nlike justice, beauty, kindness,\nare akin to scientific quantities,\nlike length, mass and weight.\nTake any comparative question not involving value,\nsuch as which of two suitcases is heavier.\nThere are only three possibilities.\nThe weight of one is greater, lesser\nor equal to the weight of the other.\nProperties like weight can be represented\nby real numbers -- one, two, three and so on --\nand there are only three possible comparisons\nbetween any two real numbers.\nOne number is greater, lesser,\nor equal to the other.\nNot so with values.\nAs post-Enlightenment creatures,\nwe tend to assume\nthat scientific thinking holds the key\nto everything of importance in our world,\nbut the world of value\nis different from the world of science.\nThe stuff of the one world\ncan be quantified by real numbers.\nThe stuff of the other world can't.\nWe shouldn't assume\nthat the world of is, of lengths and weights,\nhas the same structure as the world of ought,\nof what we should do."
p4094
aS'\nSo if what matters to us --\na child\'s delight, the love\nyou have for your partner \ncan\'t be represented by real numbers,\nthen there\'s no reason to believe\nthat in choice, there are only three possibilities --\nthat one alternative is better, worse or equal\nto the other.\nWe need to introduce a new, fourth relation\nbeyond being better, worse or equal,\nthat describes what\'s going on in hard choices.\nI like to say that the alternatives are\n"on a par."\nWhen alternatives are on a par,\nit may matter very much which you choose,\nbut one alternative isn\'t better than the other.\nRather, the alternatives are in\nthe same neighborhood of value,\nin the same league of value,\nwhile at the same time being very different\nin kind of value.\nThat\'s why the choice is hard.'
p4095
aS"\nUnderstanding hard choices in this way\nuncovers something about ourselves we didn't know.\nEach of us has the power\nto create reasons.\nImagine a world in which every choice you face\nis an easy choice,\nthat is, there's always a best alternative.\nIf there's a best alternative,\nthen that's the one you should choose,\nbecause part of being rational\nis doing the better thing rather than the worse thing,\nchoosing what you have most reason to choose.\nIn such a world,\nwe'd have most reason\nto wear black socks instead of pink socks,\nto eat cereal instead of donuts,\nto live in the city rather than the country,\nto marry Betty instead of Lolita.\nA world full of only easy choices\nwould enslave us to reasons."
p4096
aS"\nWhen you think about it,\nit's nuts to believe\nthat the reasons given to you\ndictated that you had most reason to pursue\nthe exact hobbies you do,\nto live in the exact house you do,\nto work at the exact job you do.\nInstead, you faced alternatives\nthat were on a par  hard choices \nand you made reasons for yourself\nto choose that hobby, that house and that job.\nWhen alternatives are on a par,\nthe reasons given to us, the ones\nthat determine whether we're making a mistake,\nare silent as to what to do.\nIt's here, in the space of hard choices,\nthat we get to exercise\nour normative power,\nthe power to create reasons for yourself,\nto make yourself\ninto the kind of person\nfor whom country living\nis preferable to the urban life."
p4097
aS"\nWhen we choose between\noptions that are on a par,\nwe can do something really rather remarkable.\nWe can put our very selves behind an option.\nHere's where I stand.\nHere's who I am. I am for banking.\nI am for chocolate donuts.\nThis response in hard choices\nis a rational response,\nbut it's not dictated by reasons given to us.\nRather, it's supported by reasons created by us.\nWhen we create reasons for ourselves\nto become this kind of person rather than that,\nwe wholeheartedly become the people that we are.\nYou might say that we become the authors\nof our own lives."
p4098
aS"\nSo when we face hard choices,\nwe shouldn't beat our head against a wall\ntrying to figure out which alternative is better.\nThere is no best alternative.\nInstead of looking for reasons out there,\nwe should be looking for reasons in here:\nWho am I to be?\nYou might decide to be a pink sock-wearing,\ncereal-loving, country-living banker,\nand I might decide to be a black sock-wearing,\nurban, donut-loving artist.\nWhat we do in hard choices is very much\nup to each of us."
p4099
aS"\nNow, people who don't exercise their\nnormative powers in hard choices\nare drifters.\nWe all know people like that.\nI drifted into being a lawyer.\nI didn't put my agency behind lawyering.\nI wasn't for lawyering.\nDrifters allow the world\nto write the story of their lives.\nThey let mechanisms of reward and punishment --\npats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option \nto determine what they do.\nSo the lesson of hard choices:\nreflect on what you can put your agency behind,\non what you can be for,\nand through hard choices,\nbecome that person."
p4100
aS"\nFar from being sources of agony and dread,\nhard choices are precious opportunities\nfor us to celebrate what is special\nabout the human condition,\nthat the reasons that govern our choices\nas correct or incorrect\nsometimes run out,\nand it is here, in the space of hard choices,\nthat we have the power\nto create reasons for ourselves\nto become the distinctive people that we are.\nAnd that's why hard choices are not a curse\nbut a godsend."

p4105
aS"\nI want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,\nusing fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.\nThe mycelium infuses all landscapes,\nit holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.\nThis holds up to 30,000 times its mass.\nThey're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.\nThey generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.\nWe have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer\nof nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --\nso the mycelium is the mother\nthat is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees\nto hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs."

aS"\nDusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.\nI'm in love with the old-growth forest,\nand I'm a patriotic American because we have those.\nMost of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.\nAnd frankly, I face a big obstacle.\nWhen I mention mushrooms to somebody,\nthey immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,\ntheir eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.\nSo, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.\nWe call it mycophobia,\nthe irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi."
p4107
aS"\nMushrooms are very fast in their growth.\nDay 21, day 23, day 25.\nMushrooms produce strong antibiotics.\nIn fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.\nA group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists\npublished a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --\na super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.\nWe share in common the same pathogens.\nFungi don't like to rot from bacteria,\nand so our best antibiotics come from fungi.\nBut here is a mushroom that's past its prime.\nAfter they sporulate, they do rot.\nBut I propose to you that the sequence of microbes\nthat occur on rotting mushrooms\nare essential for the health of the forest.\nThey give rise to the trees,\nthey create the debris fields that feed the mycelium."
p4108
aS'\nAnd so we see a mushroom here sporulating.\nAnd the spores are germinating,\nand the mycelium forms and goes underground.\nIn a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.\nMy foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.'
p4109
aS"\nThis is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.\nAnd notice that as the mycelium grows,\nit conquers territory and then it begins the net.\nI've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,\nI have thousands of electron micrographs,\nand when I'm staring at the mycelium,\nI realize that they are microfiltration membranes.\nWe exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.\nIt inhales oxygen, just like we do.\nBut these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.\nAnd I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.\nAnd in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,\nand as they fuse soils, they absorb water.\nThese are little wells.\nAnd inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.\nAnd so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,\nbut sets up a microbial universe\nthat gives rise to a plurality of other organisms."
p4110
aS"\nI first proposed, in the early 1990s,\nthat mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.\nWhen you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.\nAnd if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,\nbecause of the nodes of crossing --\nInternet engineers maybe call them hot points --\nthere are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.\nThe mycelium is sentient.\nIt knows that you are there.\nWhen you walk across landscapes,\nit leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.\nSo, I believe the invention of the computer Internet\nis an inevitable consequence\nof a previously proven, biologically successful model.\nThe Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,\nand we now, being the top organism on this planet,\nare trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere."
p4111
aS'\nGoing way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.\nI believe matter begets life;\nlife becomes single cells; single cells become strings;\nstrings become chains; chains network.\nAnd this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.'
p4112
aS"\nMost of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.\nThey came to land 1.3 billion years ago,\nand plants followed several hundred million years later.\nHow is that possible?\nIt's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,\nand many other acids and enzymes,\npockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals\nand forming calcium oxalates.\nMakes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.\nOxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.\nSo, fungi and mycelium\nsequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.\nAnd all sorts of other oxalates\nare also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals\nthat are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix."
p4113
aS"\nThis was first discovered in 1859.\nThis is a photograph by Franz Hueber.\nThis photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.\n420 million years ago, this organism existed.\nIt was called Prototaxites.\nPrototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.\nThe tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.\nDr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,\npublished an article in the Journal of Geology\nthis past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,\na giant mushroom.\nAcross the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.\nAll across most land masses.\nAnd these existed for tens of millions of years."
p4114
aS"\nNow, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --\n65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --\nwe had an asteroid impact.\nThe Earth was struck by an asteroid,\na huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.\nSunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.\nThose organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,\nbecause fungi do not need light.\nMore recently, at Einstein University,\nthey just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,\nmuch like plants use light.\nSo, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,\nI think, is a forgone conclusion,\nat least in my own mind."

aS"\nThe largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.\nI couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:\n2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.\nThe largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.\nHow is it that this organism can be so large,\nand yet be one cell wall thick,\nwhereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?\nThe mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --\nit bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.\nWe were involved with several experiments.\nI'm going to show you six, if I can,\nsolutions for helping to save the world.\nBattelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.\nThere were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:\none was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;\none pile was treated with bacteria;\nand our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.\nThe mycelium absorbs the oil.\nThe mycelium is producing enzymes --\nperoxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.\nThese are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.\nSo, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,\nand then, when we returned six weeks later,\nall the tarps were removed,\nall the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.\nWe came back to our pile, it was covered\nwith hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,\nand the color changed to a light form.\nThe enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons\ninto carbohydrates -- fungal sugars."
p4116
aS"\nSome of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.\nThey're very large.\nThey're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.\nBut something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.\nThey sporulated, the spores attract insects,\nthe insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.\nBirds then came, bringing in seeds,\nand our pile became an oasis of life.\nWhereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,\nand the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --\nwent from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.\nThe last image we don't have.\nThe entire pile was a green berm of life.\nThese are gateway species,\nvanguard species that open the door for other biological communities."
p4117
aS"\nSo I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --\nand putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,\nyou can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream\nfrom a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,\nor a factory with chemical toxins,\nand it leads to habitat restoration.\nSo, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,\nand we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.\nAnd I'll show you a graph here.\nThis is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.\nThere's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,\nand 10 to the third power is around 1,000.\nIn 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species\nreduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.\nThink of the implications.\nThis is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --\nand we can guarantee that we will have storms every year."
p4118
aS"\nSo, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.\nThis is my wife Dusty,\nwith a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.\nIt's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest\nthat Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.\nas a treatment against consumption.\nThis mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,\nnorthern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.\nMay not seem that large --\nlet's get closer.\nThis is extremely rare fungus.\nOur team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --\nwe went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.\nWe found one sample to be able to get into culture."
p4119
aS'\nPreserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest\nI think is absolutely critical for human health.\nI\'ve been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.\nWe submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,\nand mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.\nAnd a few years ago,\nwe received these results.\nWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms\nthat were highly active against poxviruses.\nDr. Earl Kern, who\'s a smallpox expert\nof the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds\nthat have a selectivity index of two or more are active.\n10 or greater are considered to be very active.\nOur mushroom strains were in the highly active range.\nThere\'s a vetted press release that you can read --\nit\'s vetted by DOD --\nif you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."\nOr you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.'
p4120
aS"\nSo, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.\nAnd so, for the first time, I am showing this.\nWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms\nhighly active against flu viruses.\nHere's the selectivity index numbers --\nagainst pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,\ncompared to the ribavirin controls,\nwe have an extraordinarily high activity.\nAnd we're using a natural extract\nwithin the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.\nWe tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --\nas well as flu B viruses.\nSo then we tried a blend,\nand in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,\nand we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.\n(Applause)\nI then think that we can make the argument\nthat we should save the old-growth forest\nas a matter of national defense.\n(Applause)"
p4121
aS"\nI became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --\nfungi that kill insects.\nOur house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.\nSo, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies\nwith metarhizium species of a group of fungi\nthat kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.\nI did something that nobody else had done.\nI actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.\nThese are spores -- this is in their spores.\nI was able to morph the culture\ninto a non-sporulating form.\nAnd so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars\nspecifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.\nBut the insects aren't stupid,\nand they would avoid the spores when they came close,\nand so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.\nAnd I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,\nI put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants\nwere making debris fields, every day,\nin my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,\nbecause there's no spores.\nThey gave it to the queen.\nOne week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever."
p4122
aS"\nAnd then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --\nthe mycelium is consumed by the ants,\nthey become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.\n(Laughter)\nNow after sporulation, the spores repel.\nSo, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.\nSo, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.\nAnd so my house came down, I received my first patent\nagainst carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.\nThen we tried extracts, and lo and behold,\nwe can steer insects to different directions.\nThis has huge implications.\nI then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.\nIt's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.\nIt covers over 200,000 species.\nThis is the most disruptive technology --\nI've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --\nthat they have ever witnessed.\nThis could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.\nYou could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,\nbecause my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,\nprior to sporulation, attract the very insects\nthat are otherwise repelled by those spores."
p4123
aS"\nAnd so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.\nThe Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --\nyou add soil, you add water,\nyou have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,\nlike of the Agarikon mushroom.\nThe seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.\nAnd then you put tree seeds in here,\nand then you end up growing -- potentially --\nan old-growth forest from a cardboard box."
p4124

S'\nSo I want to talk today about money and happiness,\nwhich are two things\nthat a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,\neither trying to earn them or trying to increase them.\nAnd a lot of us resonate with this phrase.\nSo we see it in religions and self-help books,\nthat money can\'t buy happiness.\nAnd I want to suggest today that, in fact, that\'s wrong.\n(Laughter)\nI\'m at a business school, so that\'s what we do.\nSo that\'s wrong, and, in fact, if you think that,\nyou\'re actually just not spending it right.\nSo that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,\nmaybe if you spent it differently,\nthat might work a little bit better.\nAnd before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier,\nlet\'s think about the ways we usually spend it\nthat don\'t, in fact, make us happier.\nWe had a little natural experiment.\nSo CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article\non what happens to people when they win the lottery.\nIt turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing.\nThis article\'s about how their lives get ruined.\nSo what happens when people win the lottery\nis, number one, they spend all the money and go into debt,\nand number two, all of their friends and everyone they\'ve ever met\nfind them and bug them for money.\nAnd it ruins their social relationships, in fact.\nSo they have more debt and worse friendships\nthan they had before they won the lottery.\nWhat was interesting about the article\nwas people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.\nAnd instead of talking about\nhow it had made them realize that money doesn\'t lead to happiness,\neveryone instantly started saying,\n"You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ?"\nand fantasizing about what they\'d do.\nAnd here\'s just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about.\nOne person wrote in, "When I win, I\'m going to buy my own little mountain\nand have a little house on top."\n(Laughter)\nAnd another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money\nand get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar\nand sipping a glass of champagne."\nThis is even worse now: "Then I\'d have a picture taken\nand dozens of glossies made.\nAnyone begging for money or trying to extort from me\nwould receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."\n(Laughter)\nAnd so many of the comments were exactly of this type,\nwhere people got money\nand, in fact, it made them antisocial.\nSo I told you that it ruins people\'s lives and that their friends bug them.\nIt also, money often makes us feel very selfish\nand we do things only for ourselves.\nWell maybe the reason that money doesn\'t make us happy\nis that we\'re always spending it on the wrong things,\nand in particular, that we\'re always spending it on ourselves.\nAnd we thought, I wonder what would happen\nif we made people spend more of their money on other people.\nSo instead of being antisocial with your money,\nwhat if you were a little more prosocial with your money?\nAnd we thought, let\'s make people do it and see what happens.\nSo let\'s have some people do what they usually do\nand spend money on themselves,\nand let\'s make some people give money away,\nand measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.\nSo the first way that we did this.\nOn one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus\nat University of British Columbia\nand we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"\nThey said, "Yes."\nWe asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.\nAnd one of the envelopes had things in it that said,\n"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself."\nSo we gave some examples of what you could spend it on.\nOther people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said,\n"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else."\nAlso inside the envelope was money.\nAnd we manipulated how much money we gave them.\nSo some people got this slip of paper and five dollars.\nSome people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.\nWe let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do.\nWe found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to.\nWe called them up at night and asked them,\n"What\'d you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?"\nWhat did they spend it on?\nWell these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves\nwere things like earrings and makeup.\nOne woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.\nPeople gave money to homeless people.\nHuge effect here of Starbucks.\n(Laughter)\nSo if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them\nand they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.\nBut some people bought a coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,\nbut other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else.\nSo the very same purchase,\njust targeted toward yourself\nor targeted toward somebody else.\nWhat did we find when we called them back at the end of the day?\nPeople who spent money on other people got happier.\nPeople who spent money on themselves, nothing happened.\nIt didn\'t make them less happy, it just didn\'t do much for them.\nAnd the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn\'t matter that much.\nSo people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars.\nIn fact, it doesn\'t matter how much money you spent.\nWhat really matters is that you spent it on somebody else\nrather than on yourself.\nWe see this again and again\nwhen we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.\nOf course, these are undergraduates in Canada --\nnot the world\'s most representative population.\nThey\'re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things.\nWe wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world\nor just among wealthy countries.\nSo we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.\nSo imagine, instead of just people in Canada,\nwe said, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.\nDescribe it. How happy did it make you?"\nOr in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money\non yourself or other people and describe that."\nAnd then we asked them how happy they are again.\nAnd what we see is sort of amazing\nbecause there\'s human universals on what you do with your money\nand then real cultural differences on what you do as well.\nSo for example,\none guy from Uganda says this.\nHe said, "I called a girl I wished to love."\nThey basically went out on a date,\nand he says at the end that he didn\'t "achieve" her up till now.\nHere\'s a guy from Canada.\nVery similar thing.\n"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.\nWe went to a movie, we left early,\nand then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake.\nHuman universal -- so you spend money on other people,\nyou\'re being nice to them.\nMaybe you have something in mind, maybe not.\nBut then we see extraordinary differences.\nSo look at these two.\nThis is a woman from Canada.\nWe say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."\nShe says, "I bought a present for my mom.\nI drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom."\nPerfectly nice thing to do.\nIt\'s good to get gifts for people that you know.\nCompare that to this woman from Uganda.\n"I was walking and met a long-time friend\nwhose son was sick with malaria.\nThey had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."\nThis isn\'t $10,000, it\'s the local currency.\nSo it\'s a very small amount of money, in fact.\nBut enormously different motivations here.\nThis is a real medical need,\nliterally a life-saving donation.\nAbove, it\'s just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.\nWhat we see again though\nis that the specific way that you spend on other people\nisn\'t nearly as important\nas the fact that you spend on other people\nin order to make yourself happy,\nwhich is really quite important.\nSo you don\'t have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.\nYou can do small, trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this.\nThese are only two countries.\nWe also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could\nto see what the relationship is between money and happiness.\nWe got data from the Gallup Organization,\nwhich you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.\nThey ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"\nand they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?"\nAnd we can see what the relationship is between those two things.\nAre they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy.\nOr are they negatively correlated?\nOn this map, green will mean they\'re positively correlated\nand red means they\'re negatively correlated.\nAnd you can see, the world is crazily green.\nSo in almost every country in the world\nwhere we have this data,\npeople who give money to charity are happier people\nthat people who don\'t give money to charity.\nI know you\'re all looking at that red country in the middle.\nI would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,\nbut in fact, it\'s Central African Republic.\nYou can make up stories. Maybe it\'s different there for some reason or another.\nJust below that to the right is Rwanda though,\nwhich is amazingly green.\nSo almost everywhere we look\nwe see that giving money away makes you happier\nthan keeping it for yourself.\nWhat about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time\nwhen we\'re not with the people we know.\nWe decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.\nSo these are sales teams in Belgium.\nThey work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors\nand try to get them to buy drugs.\nSo we can look and see how well they sell things\nas a function of being a member of a team.\nSome teams, we give people on the team some money for themselves\nand say, "Spend it however you want on yourself,"\njust like we did with the undergrads in Canada.\nBut other teams we say, "Here\'s 15 euro.\nSpend it on one of your teammates this week.\nBuy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them.\nAnd then we can see, well now we\'ve got teams that spend on themselves\nand we\'ve got these prosocial teams\nwho we give money to make the team a little bit better.\nThe reason I have a ridiculous pinata there\nis one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata,\nand they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.\nA very silly, trivial thing to do,\nbut think of the difference on a team that didn\'t do that at all,\nthat got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,\nmaybe bought themselves a coffee,\nor teams that had this prosocial experience\nwhere they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.\nWhat we see is that, in fact, the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff\nthan the teams that only got money for themselves.\nAnd one way to think about it\nis for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,\nthey put it in their pocket, they don\'t do anything different than they did before.\nYou don\'t get any money from that.\nYou actually lose money because it doesn\'t motivate them to perform any better.\nBut when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,\nthey do so much better on their teams\nthat you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.\nAnd I realize that you\'re probably thinking to yourselves,\nthis is all fine,\nbut there\'s a context that\'s incredibly important for public policy\nand I can\'t imagine it would work there.\nAnd basically that if he doesn\'t show me that it works here,\nI don\'t believe anything he said.\nAnd I know what you\'re all thinking about are dodgeball teams.\n(Laughter)\nThis was a huge criticism that we got\nto say, if you can\'t show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.\nSo we went out and found these dodgeball teams\nand infiltrated them.\nAnd we did the exact same thing as before.\nSo some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves.\nOther teams, we give them money\nto spend on their dodgeball teammates.\nThe teams that spend money on themselves\nare just the same winning percentages as they were before.\nThe teams that we give the money to spend on each other,\nthey become different teams\nand, in fact, they dominate the league by the time they\'re done.\nAcross all of these different contexts --\nyour personal life, you work life,\neven silly things like intramural sports --\nwe see spending on other people has a bigger return for you\nthan spending on yourself.\nAnd so I\'ll just say, I think if you think money can\'t buy happiness\nyou\'re not spending it right.\nThe implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product\nand that\'s the way to make yourself happier.\nIt\'s in fact, that you should stop thinking\nabout which product to buy for yourself\nand try giving some of it to other people instead.\nAnd we luckily have an opportunity for you.\nDonorsChoose.org is a non-profit\nfor mainly public school teachers in low-income schools.\nThey post projects,\nso they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don\'t have the books,"\nor "I want a microscope to teach my students science\nand we don\'t have a microscope."\nYou and I can go on and buy it for them.\nThe teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.\nSometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope.\nIt\'s an extraordinary thing.\nGo to the website and start yourself on the process\nof thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?"\nand more about "If I\'ve got five dollars or 15 dollars,\nwhat can I do to benefit other people?"\nBecause ultimately when you do that, you\'ll find that you\'ll benefit yourself much more.\nThank you.\n(Applause)'

p4152
aS'\nWhen I was little, my mother used to say,\n"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.\nAnd until you have children, you don\'t know what it\'s like."\nAnd when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world\nthat she would say that about parenting my brother and me.\nAnd when I was an adolescent, I thought\nthat I\'m gay, and so I probably can\'t have a family.\nAnd when she said it, it made me anxious.\nAnd after I came out of the closet,\nwhen she continued to say it, it made me furious.\nI said, "I\'m gay. That\'s not the direction that I\'m headed in.\nAnd I want you to stop saying that."'
p4153
aS"\nAbout 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine\nto write a piece about deaf culture.\nAnd I was rather taken aback.\nI had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.\nThose poor people, they couldn't hear.\nThey lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?\nAnd then I went out into the deaf world.\nI went to deaf clubs.\nI saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.\nI even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee\nwhere people complained about that slurry Southern signing."
p4154
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4155
aS'\nAnd as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,\nI become convinced that deafness was a culture\nand that the people in the deaf world who said,\n"We don\'t lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"\nwere saying something that was viable.\nIt wasn\'t my culture,\nand I didn\'t particularly want to rush off and join it,\nbut I appreciated that it was a culture\nand that for the people who were members of it,\nit felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.\nIt felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.'
p4156
aS'\nThen a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.\nAnd when her daughter was born,\nshe suddenly found herself confronting questions\nthat now began to seem quite resonant to me.\nShe was facing the question of what to do with this child.\nShould she say, "You\'re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"\nOr should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,\nget involved in the Little People of America,\nbecome aware of what was happening for dwarfs?'
p4157
aS'\nAnd I suddenly thought,\nmost deaf children are born to hearing parents.\nThose hearing parents tend to try to cure them.\nThose deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.\nMost gay people are born to straight parents.\nThose straight parents often want them to function\nin what they think of as the mainstream world,\nand those gay people have to discover identity later on.\nAnd here was this friend of mine\nlooking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.\nAnd I thought, there it is again:\nA family that perceives itself to be normal\nwith a child who seems to be extraordinary.\nAnd I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.'
p4158
aS"\nThere are vertical identities,\nwhich are passed down generationally from parent to child.\nThose are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.\nThose are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.\nAnd while some of them can be difficult,\nthere's no attempt to cure them.\nYou can argue that it's harder in the United States --\nour current presidency notwithstanding --\nto be a person of color.\nAnd yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure\nthat the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians\ncome out with creamy skin and yellow hair."
p4159
aS'\nThere are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.\nAnd I call them horizontal identities,\nbecause the peer group is the horizontal experience.\nThese are identities that are alien to your parents\nand that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.\nAnd those identities, those horizontal identities,\npeople have almost always tried to cure.'
p4160
aS"\nAnd I wanted to look at what the process is\nthrough which people who have those identities\ncome to a good relationship with them.\nAnd it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance\nthat needed to take place.\nThere's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.\nAnd they don't always coincide."
p4161
aS"\nAnd a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry\nbecause they feel as though their parents don't love them,\nwhen what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.\nLove is something that ideally is there unconditionally\nthroughout the relationship between a parent and a child.\nBut acceptance is something that takes time.\nIt always takes time."
p4162
aS'\nOne of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.\nWhen he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,\na very disabling condition,\nand his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,\nhe would have no intellectual capacity,\nand he would probably not even recognize them.\nAnd it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital\nso that he could die there quietly.'
p4163
aS"\nAnd his mother said she wasn't going to do it.\nAnd she took her son home.\nAnd even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,\nshe found the best doctor in the country\nfor dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,\nand she got Clinton enrolled with him.\nAnd in the course of his childhood,\nhe had 30 major surgical procedures.\nAnd he spent all this time stuck in the hospital\nwhile he was having those procedures,\nas a result of which he now can walk."
p4164
aS'\nAnd while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.\nAnd he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.\nAnd he ended up achieving at a level\nthat had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.\nHe was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,\nwhere he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car\nthat accommodated his unusual body.'
p4165
aS'\nAnd his mother told me this story of coming home one day --\nand he went to college nearby --\nand she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,\nin the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter)\n"And I thought to myself, they\'re six feet tall, he\'s three feet tall.\nTwo beers for them is four beers for him."\nShe said, "I knew I couldn\'t go in there and interrupt him,\nbut I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."\nShe said, "And then I thought,\nif someone had said to me when he was born\nthat my future worry would be that he\'d go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- "'
p4166
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4167
aS'\nAnd I said to her, "What do you think you did\nthat helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"\nAnd she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that\'s all.\nClinton just always had that light in him.\nAnd his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."'
p4168
aS'\nI\'m going to quote from another magazine of the \'60s.\nThis one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America --\nwritten by an important bioethicist.\nHe said, "There is no reason to feel guilty\nabout putting a Down syndrome child away,\nwhether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium\nor in a more responsible, lethal sense.\nIt is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.\nTrue guilt arises only from an offense against a person,\nand a Down\'s is not a person."'
p4169
aS"\nThere's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made\nin the treatment of gay people.\nThe fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.\nBut we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,\nhow we used to see people who were disabled,\nhow inhuman we held people to be.\nAnd the change that's been accomplished there,\nwhich is almost equally radical,\nis one that we pay not very much attention to."
p4170
aS'\nOne of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,\nwere taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,\ntheir first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.\nThey thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,\nand so they decided they would build a little center --\ntwo classrooms that they started with a few other parents --\nto educate kids with D.S.\nAnd over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,\nwhere there are now thousands upon thousands\nof children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.'
p4171
aS'\nIn the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,\nthe life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.\nThe experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,\nthose who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.'

aS'\nThe Robards had a lot to do with that.\nAnd I said, "Do you regret it?\nDo you wish your child didn\'t have Down syndrome?\nDo you wish you\'d never heard of it?"\nAnd interestingly his father said,\n"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,\nbecause for David, it\'s a difficult way to be in the world,\nand I\'d like to give David an easier life.\nBut I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."'
p4173
aS'\nAnd Karen Robards said to me, "I\'m with Tom.\nFor David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.\nBut speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born\nthat I could come to such a point --\nspeaking for myself, it\'s made me so much better and so much kinder\nand so much more purposeful in my whole life,\nthat speaking for myself, I wouldn\'t give it up for anything in the world."'
p4174
aS'\nWe live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions\nis on the up and up.\nAnd yet we also live at the moment\nwhen our ability to eliminate those conditions\nhas reached a height we never imagined before.\nMost deaf infants born in the United States now\nwill receive Cochlear implants,\nwhich are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,\nand which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.\nA compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,\nis useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.\nAchondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,\nand mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,\ngrow to full size.\nTesting in humans is around the corner.\nThere are blood tests which are making progress\nthat would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,\nmaking it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,\nor to terminate them.'
p4175
aS"\nAnd so we have both social progress and medical progress.\nAnd I believe in both of them.\nI believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,\nand I think the same thing about the medical progress.\nBut I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.\nAnd when I see the way they're intersecting\nin conditions like the three I've just described,\nI sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera\nwhen the hero realizes he loves the heroine\nat the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan."
p4176
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4177
aS'\nWe have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.\nAnd a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,\nwhat do we validate in our children,\nand what do we cure in them?'
p4178
aS'\nJim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,\n"When parents say \'I wish my child did not have autism,\'\nwhat they\'re really saying is \'I wish the child I have did not exist\nand I had a different, non-autistic child instead.\'\nRead that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.\nThis is what we hear when you pray for a cure --\nthat your fondest wish for us\nis that someday we will cease to be\nand strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."\nIt\'s a very extreme point of view,\nbut it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have\nand they don\'t want to be cured or changed or eliminated.\nThey want to be whoever it is that they\'ve come to be.'
p4179
aS"\nOne of the families I interviewed for this project\nwas the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.\nIt took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,\nand once they agreed, they were so full of their story\nthat they couldn't stop telling it.\nAnd the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many --\nI recorded more than 20 hours of conversation."
p4180
aS'\nAnd on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.\nWe were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.\nAnd I said, "If Dylan were here now,\ndo you have a sense of what you\'d want to ask him?"\nAnd his father said, "I sure do.\nI\'d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."\nAnd Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.\nAnd then she looked back up and said,\n"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother\nand never knowing what was going on inside his head."'
p4181
aS'\nWhen I had dinner with her a couple of years later --\none of many dinners that we had together --\nshe said, "You know, when it first happened,\nI used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.\nIf I hadn\'t gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,\nthis child wouldn\'t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn\'t have happened.\nBut I\'ve come to feel that I love the children I had so much\nthat I don\'t want to imagine a life without them.\nI recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,\nbut the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.\n"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world\nif Dylan had never been born,\nI\'ve decided that it would not have been better for me."'
p4182
aS"\nI thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,\nproblems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,\nand that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.\nAnd then I thought, all of us who have children\nlove the children we have, with their flaws.\nIf some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling\nand offered to take away the children I have\nand give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --\nI would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.\nAnd ultimately I feel\nthat in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno\nto ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,\nso these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences\nreflect on the universal experience of parenting,\nwhich is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,\nwhere did you come from?"
p4183
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4184
aS"\nIt turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --\nthere are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,\nthere are only so many families of children who are transgender,\nthere are only so many families of prodigies --\nwho also face similar challenges in many ways --\nthere are only so many families in each of those categories --\nbut if you start to think\nthat the experience of negotiating difference within your family\nis what people are addressing,\nthen you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.\nIronically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,\nthat unite us."
p4185
aS'\nI decided to have children while I was working on this project.\nAnd many people were astonished and said,\n"But how can you decide to have children\nin the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"\nAnd I said, "I\'m not studying everything that can go wrong.\nWhat I\'m studying is how much love there can be,\neven when everything appears to be going wrong."'
p4186
aS'\nI thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,\na severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.\nAnd when his ashes were interred, his mother said,\n"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,\nonce of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."\nAnd I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child\nif they had the effective will to do so.'
p4187
aS"\nSo my husband is the biological father of two children\nwith some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.\nI had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.\nAnd so she and I have a daughter,\nand mother and daughter live in Texas.\nAnd my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time\nof whom I am the biological father,\nand our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,\nthe lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis."

p4190
aS"\nAnd there are people who think that the existence of my family\nsomehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.\nAnd there are people who think that families like mine\nshouldn't be allowed to exist.\nAnd I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.\nAnd I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity\nto ensure that the planet can go on,\nso we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family\nin order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness."
p4191
aS"\nThe day after our son was born,\nthe pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.\nHe wasn't extending his legs appropriately.\nShe said that might mean that he had brain damage.\nIn so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,\nwhich she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.\nAnd he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus."
p4192
aS"\nAnd as she told me all of these things,\nI felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.\nAnd I thought, here I had been working for years\non a book about how much meaning people had found\nin the experience of parenting children who are disabled,\nand I didn't want to join their number.\nBecause what I was encountering was an idea of illness.\nAnd like all parents since the dawn of time,\nI wanted to protect my child from illness.\nAnd I wanted also to protect myself from illness.\nAnd yet, I knew from the work I had done\nthat if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,\nthat those would ultimately be his identity,\nand if they were his identity they would become my identity,\nthat that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded."
p4193
aS'\nWe took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,\nwe took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.\nWe felt helpless.\nAnd at the end of five hours,\nthey said that his brain was completely clear\nand that he was by then extending his legs correctly.\nAnd when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,\nshe said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.'
p4194
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4195
aS"\nBut I thought how my mother was right.\nI thought, the love you have for your children\nis unlike any other feeling in the world,\nand until you have children, you don't know what it feels like."

aS"\nI think children had ensnared me\nthe moment I connected fatherhood with loss.\nBut I'm not sure I would have noticed that\nif I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.\nI'd encountered so much strange love,\nand I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.\nAnd I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities."
p4197
aS"\nDuring these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned\nthe terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,\nand I had come to see how it conquers everything else.\nAnd while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,\nenslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children\nand trying to breed identity out of misery,\nI realized that day that my research had built me a plank\nand that I was ready to join them on their ship."

p4204

p4205
aS"\nCA: So just to give some context\nfor those who don't know the whole story --\n(Applause) \nthis time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii\nworking as a consultant to the NSA.\nAs a sysadmin, you had access\nto their systems,\nand you began revealing\ncertain classified documents\nto some handpicked journalists\nleading the way to June's revelations.\nNow, what propelled you to do this?\nES: You know,\nwhen I was sitting in Hawaii,\nand the years before, when I was\nworking in the intelligence community,\nI saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.\nWe do a lot of good things\nin the intelligence community,\nthings that need to be done,\nand things that help everyone.\nBut there are also things that go too far.\nThere are things that shouldn't be done,\nand decisions that were being made in secret\nwithout the public's awareness,\nwithout the public's consent,\nand without even our representatives in government\nhaving knowledge of these programs.\nWhen I really came to struggle with these issues,\nI thought to myself,\nhow can I do this in the most responsible way,\nthat maximizes the public benefit\nwhile minimizing the risks?\nAnd out of all the solutions that I could come up with,\nout of going to Congress,\nwhen there were no laws,\nthere were no legal protections\nfor a private employee,\na contractor in intelligence like myself,\nthere was a risk that I would be\nburied along with the information\nand the public would never find out.\nBut the First Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution\nguarantees us a free press for a reason,\nand that's to enable an adversarial press,\nto challenge the government,\nbut also to work together with the government,\nto have a dialogue and debate about how we can\ninform the public about matters of vital importance\nwithout putting our national security at risk.\nAnd by working with journalists,\nby giving all of my information\nback to the American people,\nrather than trusting myself to make\nthe decisions about publication,\nwe've had a robust debate\nwith a deep investment by the government\nthat I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.\nAnd the risks that have been threatened,\nthe risks that have been played up\nby the government\nhave never materialized.\nWe've never seen any evidence\nof even a single instance of specific harm,\nand because of that,\nI'm comfortable with the decisions that I made."
p4206
aS"\nCA: So let me show the audience\na couple of examples of what you revealed.\nIf we could have a slide up, and Ed,\nI don't know whether you can see,\nthe slides are here.\nThis is a slide of the PRISM program,\nand maybe you could tell the audience\nwhat that was that was revealed."
p4207
aS"\nES: The best way to understand PRISM,\nbecause there's been a little bit of controversy,\nis to first talk about what PRISM isn't.\nMuch of the debate in the U.S.\nhas been about metadata.\nThey've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,\nand they're talking about a specific legal authority\ncalled Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\nThat allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,\nmass surveillance of the entire country's\nphone records, things like that --\nwho you're talking to,\nwhen you're talking to them,\nwhere you traveled.\nThese are all metadata events.\nPRISM is about content.\nIt's a program through which the government could\ncompel corporate America,\nit could deputize corporate America\nto do its dirty work for the NSA.\nAnd even though some of\nthese companies did resist,\neven though some of them --\nI believe Yahoo was one of them \nchallenged them in court, they all lost,\nbecause it was never tried by an open court.\nThey were only tried by a secret court.\nAnd something that we've seen,\nsomething about the PRISM program\nthat's very concerning to me is,\nthere's been a talking point in the U.S. government\nwhere they've said 15 federal judges\nhave reviewed these programs\nand found them to be lawful,\nbut what they don't tell you\nis those are secret judges\nin a secret court\nbased on secret interpretations of law\nthat's considered 34,000 warrant requests\nover 33 years,\nand in 33 years only rejected\n11 government requests.\nThese aren't the people that we want deciding\nwhat the role of corporate America\nin a free and open Internet should be."
p4208
aS"\nCA: Now, this slide that we're showing here\nshows the dates in which\ndifferent technology companies, Internet companies,\nare alleged to have joined the program,\nand where data collection began from them.\nNow, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.\nHow was that data collected by the NSA?"
p4209
aS"\nES: Right. So the NSA's own slides\nrefer to it as direct access.\nWhat that means to an actual NSA analyst,\nsomeone like me who was working\nas an intelligence analyst\ntargeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,\nthings like that, in Hawaii,\nis the provenance of that data\nis directly from their servers.\nIt doesn't mean\nthat there's a group of company representatives\nsitting in a smoky room with the NSA\npalling around and making back-room deals\nabout how they're going to give this stuff away.\nNow each company handles it different ways.\nSome are responsible.\nSome are somewhat less responsible.\nBut the bottom line is, when we talk about\nhow this information is given,\nit's coming from the companies themselves.\nIt's not stolen from the lines.\nBut there's an important thing to remember here:\neven though companies pushed back,\neven though companies demanded,\nhey, let's do this through a warrant process,\nlet's do this\nwhere we actually have some sort of legal review,\nsome sort of basis for handing over\nthese users' data,\nwe saw stories in the Washington Post last year\nthat weren't as well reported as the PRISM story\nthat said the NSA broke in\nto the data center communications\nbetween Google to itself\nand Yahoo to itself.\nSo even these companies that are cooperating\nin at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner\nwith the NSA,\nthe NSA isn't satisfied with that,\nand because of that, we need our companies\nto work very hard\nto guarantee that they're going to represent\nthe interests of the user, and also advocate\nfor the rights of the users.\nAnd I think over the last year,\nwe've seen the companies that are named\non the PRISM slides\ntake great strides to do that,\nand I encourage them to continue."
p4210
aS'\nCA: What more should they do?'
p4211
aS'\nES: The biggest thing that an Internet company\nin America can do today, right now,\nwithout consulting with lawyers,\nto protect the rights of users worldwide,\nis to enable SSL web encryption\non every page you visit.\nThe reason this matters is today,\nif you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,\nthe NSA can see a record of that,\nthe Russian intelligence service\ncan see a record of that,\nthe Chinese service can see a record of that,\nthe French service, the German service,\nthe services of Andorra.\nThey can all see it because it\'s unencrypted.\nThe world\'s library is Amazon.com,\nbut not only do they not\nsupport encryption by default,\nyou cannot choose to use encryption\nwhen browsing through books.\nThis is something that we need to change,\nnot just for Amazon, I don\'t mean to single them out,\nbut they\'re a great example.\nAll companies need to move\nto an encrypted browsing habit by default\nfor all users who haven\'t taken any action\nor picked any special methods on their own.\nThat\'ll increase the privacy and the rights\nthat people enjoy worldwide.'
p4212
aS'\nCA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.\nI want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)\nThis is a program called Boundless Informant.\nWhat is that?'
p4213
aS"\nES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA\nfor using appropriate names on this.\nThis is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.\nBoundless Informant\nis a program that the NSA hid from Congress.\nThe NSA was previously asked by Congress,\nwas there any ability that they had\nto even give a rough ballpark estimate\nof the amount of American communications\nthat were being intercepted.\nThey said no. They said, we don't track those stats,\nand we can't track those stats.\nWe can't tell you how many communications\nwe're intercepting around the world,\nbecause to tell you that would be\nto invade your privacy.\nNow, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,\nbut the reality, when you look at this slide is,\nnot only do they have the capability,\nthe capability already exists.\nIt's already in place.\nThe NSA has its own internal data format\nthat tracks both ends of a communication,\nand if it says,\nthis communication came from America,\nthey can tell Congress how\nmany of those communications\nthey have today, right now.\nAnd what Boundless Informant tells us\nis more communications are being intercepted\nin America about Americans\nthan there are in Russia about Russians.\nI'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency\nshould be aiming for."
p4214
aS'\nCA: Ed, there was a story broken\nin the Washington Post,\nagain from your data.\nThe headline says,\n"NSA broke privacy rules\nthousands of times per year."\nTell us about that.'
p4215
aS"\nES: We also heard in Congressional\ntestimony last year,\nit was an amazing thing for someone like me\nwho came from the NSA\nand who's seen the actual internal documents,\nknows what's in them,\nto see officials testifying under oath\nthat there had been no abuses,\nthat there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,\nwhen we knew this story was coming.\nBut what's especially interesting about this,\nabout the fact that the NSA has violated\ntheir own rules, their own laws\nthousands of times in a single year,\nincluding one event by itself,\none event out of those 2,776,\nthat affected more than 3,000 people.\nIn another event, they intercepted\nall the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.\nWhat's amazing about this,\nthis report, that didn't get that much attention,\nis the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,\nthe chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,\nDianne Feinstein, had not seen this report\nuntil the Washington Post contacted her\nasking for comment on the report.\nAnd she then requested a copy from the NSA\nand received it,\nbut had never seen this before that.\nWhat does that say about the state of oversight\nin American intelligence\nwhen the chairman of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee\nhas no idea that the rules are being broken\nthousands of times every year?"
p4216
aS"\nCA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:\nWhy should we care about\nall this surveillance, honestly?\nI mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,\nyou've got nothing to worry about.\nWhat's wrong with that point of view?\nES: Well, so the first thing is,\nyou're giving up your rights.\nYou're saying hey, you know,\nI don't think I'm going to need them,\nso I'm just going to trust that, you know,\nlet's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,\nthese guys are going to do the right thing.\nYour rights matter\nbecause you never know when\nyou're going to need them.\nBeyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,\nnot just in America,\nbut in Western societies\nand in democratic societies around the world.\nPeople should be able to pick up the phone\nand to call their family,\npeople should be able to send a text message\nto their loved ones,\npeople should be able to buy a book online,\nthey should be able to travel by train,\nthey should be able to buy an airline ticket\nwithout wondering about how these events\nare going to look to an agent of the government,\npossibly not even your government\nyears in the future,\nhow they're going to be misinterpreted\nand what they're going to think your intentions were.\nWe have a right to privacy.\nWe require warrants to be based on probable cause\nor some kind of individualized suspicion\nbecause we recognize that trusting anybody,\nany government authority,\nwith the entirety of human communications\nin secret and without oversight\nis simply too great a temptation to be ignored."
p4217
aS"\nCA: Some people are furious at what you've done.\nI heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney\nwho said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,\nEdward Snowden is the lion\nthat bit the head off the dog.\nHe thinks you've committed\none of the worst acts of betrayal\nin American history.\nWhat would you say to people who think that?"
p4218
aS"\nES: Dick Cheney's really something else.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nThank you. (Laughter)\nI think it's amazing, because at the time\nJulian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,\nDick Cheney was saying\nhe was going to end governments worldwide,\nthe skies were going to ignite\nand the seas were going to boil off,\nand now he's saying it's a flea bite.\nSo we should be suspicious about the same sort of\noverblown claims of damage to national security\nfrom these kind of officials.\nBut let's assume that these\npeople really believe this.\nI would argue that they have kind of\na narrow conception of national security.\nThe prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney\ndo not keep the nation safe.\nThe public interest is not always the same\nas the national interest.\nGoing to war with people who are not our enemy\nin places that are not a threat\ndoesn't make us safe,\nand that applies whether it's in Iraq\nor on the Internet.\nThe Internet is not the enemy.\nOur economy is not the enemy.\nAmerican businesses, Chinese businesses,\nand any other company out there\nis a part of our society.\nIt's a part of our interconnected world.\nThere are ties of fraternity that bond us together,\nand if we destroy these bonds\nby undermining the standards, the security,\nthe manner of behavior,\nthat nations and citizens all around the world\nexpect us to abide by."
p4219
aS"\nCA: But it's alleged that you've stolen\n1.7 million documents.\nIt seems only a few hundred of them\nhave been shared with journalists so far.\nAre there more revelations to come?"
p4220
aS"\nES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.\nI don't think there's any question\nthat some of the most important reporting\nto be done is yet to come."
p4221
aS'\nCA: Come here, because I want to ask you\nabout this particular revelation.\nCome and take a look at this.\nI mean, this is a story which I think\nfor a lot of the techies in this room\nis the single most shocking thing\nthat they have heard in the last few months.\nIt\'s about a program called "Bullrun."\nCan you explain what that is?'
p4222
aS"\nES: So Bullrun, and this is again\nwhere we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,\nthis is a program named after a Civil War battle.\nThe British counterpart is called Edgehill,\nwhich is a U.K. civil war battle.\nAnd the reason that I believe they're named this way\nis because they target our own infrastructure.\nThey're programs through which the NSA\nintentionally misleads corporate partners.\nThey tell corporate partners that these\nare safe standards.\nThey say hey, we need to work with you\nto secure your systems,\nbut in reality, they're giving bad advice\nto these companies that makes them\ndegrade the security of their services.\nThey're building in backdoors that not only\nthe NSA can exploit,\nbut anyone else who has time and money\nto research and find it\ncan then use to let themselves in\nto the world's communications.\nAnd this is really dangerous,\nbecause if we lose a single standard,\nif we lose the trust of something like SSL,\nwhich was specifically targeted\nby the Bullrun program,\nwe will live a less safe world overall.\nWe won't be able to access our banks\nand we won't be able to access commerce\nwithout worrying about people\nmonitoring those communications\nor subverting them for their own ends."
p4223
aS'\nCA: And do those same decisions also potentially\nopen America up to cyberattacks\nfrom other sources?'
p4224
aS"\nES: Absolutely.\nOne of the problems,\none of the dangerous legacies\nthat we've seen in the post-9/11 era,\nis that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.\nThey've been in charge of offensive operations,\nthat is hacking,\nbut they've also been in\ncharge of defensive operations,\nand traditionally they've always prioritized\ndefense over offense\nbased on the principle\nthat American secrets are simply worth more.\nIf we hack a Chinese business\nand steal their secrets,\nif we hack a government office in Berlin\nand steal their secrets,\nthat has less value to the American people\nthan making sure that the Chinese\ncan't get access to our secrets.\nSo by reducing the security of our communications,\nthey're not only putting the world at risk,\nthey're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,\nbecause intellectual property is the basis,\nthe foundation of our economy,\nand if we put that at risk through weak security,\nwe're going to be paying for it for years."
p4225
aS"\nCA: But they've made a calculation\nthat it was worth doing this\nas part of America's defense against terrorism.\nSurely that makes it a price worth paying."
p4226
aS"\nES: Well, when you look at the results\nof these programs in stopping terrorism,\nyou will see that that's unfounded,\nand you don't have to take my word for it,\nbecause we've had the first open court,\nthe first federal court that's reviewed this,\noutside the secrecy arrangement,\ncalled these programs Orwellian\nand likely unconstitutional.\nCongress, who has access\nto be briefed on these things,\nand now has the desire to be,\nhas produced bills to reform it,\nand two independent White House panels\nwho reviewed all of the classified evidence\nsaid these programs have never stopped\na single terrorist attack\nthat was imminent in the United States.\nSo is it really terrorism that we're stopping?\nDo these programs have any value at all?\nI say no, and all three branches\nof the American government say no as well."
p4227
aS"\nCA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation\nfor them than the war against terrorism?"
p4228
aS"\nES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?"
p4229
aS"\nCA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation\nfor them other than the war against terrorism?"

aS"\nES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism\nhas always been what we in the intelligence world\nwould call a cover for action.\nTerrorism is something that provokes\nan emotional response that allows people\nto rationalize authorizing powers and programs\nthat they wouldn't give otherwise.\nThe Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,\nthe NSA asked for these authorities\nback in the 1990s.\nThey asked the FBI to go to\nCongress and make the case.\nThe FBI went to Congress and did make the case.\nBut Congress and the American people said no.\nThey said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.\nThey said it's worth too much damage\nto our society to justify the gains.\nBut what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,\nthey used secrecy and they\nused the justification of terrorism\nto start these programs in secret\nwithout asking Congress,\nwithout asking the American people,\nand it's that kind of government behind closed doors\nthat we need to guard ourselves against,\nbecause it makes us less safe,\nand it offers no value."
p4231
aS"\nCA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,\nbecause I've got a more personal question for you.\nSpeaking of terror,\nmost people would find the\nsituation you're in right now\nin Russia pretty terrifying.\nYou obviously heard what happened,\nwhat the treatment that Bradley Manning got,\nChelsea Manning as now is,\nand there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that\nthere are people in the intelligence community\nwho want you dead.\nHow are you coping with this?\nHow are you coping with the fear?"
p4232
aS"\nES: It's no mystery\nthat there are governments out\nthere that want to see me dead.\nI've made clear again and again and again\nthat I go to sleep every morning\nthinking about what I can\ndo for the American people.\nI don't want to harm my government.\nI want to help my government,\nbut the fact that they are willing to\ncompletely ignore due process,\nthey're willing to declare guilt\nwithout ever seeing a trial,\nthese are things that we need to work against\nas a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.\nWe shouldn't be threatening dissidents.\nWe shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.\nAnd whatever part I can do to see that end,\nI'm happy to do despite the risks."
p4233
aS"\nCA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback\nfrom the audience here,\nbecause I know there's widely differing reactions\nto Edward Snowden.\nSuppose you had the following two choices, right?\nYou could view what he did\nas fundamentally a reckless act\nthat has endangered America\nor you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act\nthat will work towards America and the world's\nlong-term good?\nThose are the two choices I'll give you.\nI'm curious to see who's willing to vote with\nthe first of those,\nthat this was a reckless act?\nThere are some hands going up.\nSome hands going up.\nIt's hard to put your hand up\nwhen the man is standing right here,\nbut I see them."

aa(lp4266
S"\nWe see with the eyes,\nbut we see with the brain as well.\nAnd seeing with the brain is often called imagination.\nAnd we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination,\nour inscapes. We've lived with them all our lives.\nBut there are also hallucinations as well,\nand hallucinations are completely different.\nThey don't seem to be of our creation.\nThey don't seem to be under our control.\nThey seem to come from the outside,\nand to mimic perception."
p4267
aS"\nSo I am going to be talking about hallucinations,\nand a particular sort of visual hallucination\nwhich I see among my patients.\nA few months ago, I got a phone call\nfrom a nursing home where I work.\nThey told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,\nwas seeing things,\nand they wondered if she'd gone bonkers\nor, because she was an old lady,\nwhether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's."
p4268
aS"\nAnd so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie,\nthe old lady.\nI went in to see her.\nIt was evident straight away\nthat she was perfectly sane\nand lucid and of good intelligence,\nbut she'd been very startled and very bewildered,\nbecause she'd been seeing things.\nAnd she told me --\nthe nurses hadn't mentioned this --\nthat she was blind,\nthat she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.\nBut now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things."
p4269
aS'\nSo I said, "What sort of things?"\nAnd she said, "People in Eastern dress,\nin drapes, walking up and down stairs.\nA man who turns towards me and smiles.\nBut he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.\nAnimals too.\nI see a white building. It\'s snowing, a soft snow.\nI see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.\nThen, one night, the scene changes.\nI see cats and dogs walking towards me.\nThey come to a certain point and then stop.\nThen it changes again.\nI see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.\nThey wear bright colors, rose and blue,\nlike Eastern dress."'
p4270
aS'\nSometimes, she said, before the people come on,\nshe may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,\nwhich seem to go up to the ceiling.\nI said, "Is this like a dream?"\nAnd she said, "No, it\'s not like a dream. It\'s like a movie."\nShe said, "It\'s got color. It\'s got motion.\nBut it\'s completely silent, like a silent movie."\nAnd she said that it\'s a rather boring movie.\nShe said, "All these people with Eastern dress,\nwalking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."\n(Laughter)'
p4271
aS"\nAnd she has a sense of humor.\nShe knew it was a hallucination.\nBut she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years\nand she'd never had a hallucination before.\nShe said that the hallucinations were unrelated\nto anything she was thinking or feeling or doing,\nthat they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.\nShe had no control over them.\nShe said she didn't recognize\nany of the people or places\nin the hallucinations.\nAnd none of the people or the animals,\nwell, they all seemed oblivious of her.\nAnd she didn't know what was going on.\nShe wondered if she was going mad\nor losing her mind."
p4272
aS'\nWell, I examined her carefully.\nShe was a bright old lady,\nperfectly sane. She had no medical problems.\nShe wasn\'t on any medications which could produce hallucinations.\nBut she was blind.\nAnd I then said to her,\n"I think I know what you have."\nI said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination\nwhich may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.\nThis was originally described," I said,\n"right back in the 18th century,\nby a man called Charles Bonnet.\nAnd you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.\nThere is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.\nYou have Charles Bonnet syndrome."'
p4273
aS'\nAnd she was very relieved at this,\nthat there was nothing seriously the matter,\nand also rather curious.\nShe said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"\nShe said, "Did he have them himself?"\nAnd she said, "Tell all the nurses\nthat I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."\n(Laughter)\n"I\'m not crazy. I\'m not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."\nWell, so I did tell the nurses.'
p4274
aS"\nNow this, for me, is a common situation.\nI work in old-age homes, largely.\nI see a lot of elderly people\nwho are hearing impaired or visually impaired.\nAbout 10 percent of the hearing impaired people\nget musical hallucinations.\nAnd about 10 percent of the visually impaired people\nget visual hallucinations.\nYou don't have to be completely blind,\nonly sufficiently impaired."
p4275
aS"\nNow with the original description in the 18th century,\nCharles Bonnet did not have them.\nHis grandfather had these hallucinations.\nHis grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.\nHe'd had cataract surgery.\nHis vision was pretty poor.\nAnd in 1759, he described to his grandson\nvarious things he was seeing."
p4276
aS'\nThe first thing he said was he saw\na handkerchief in midair.\nIt was a large blue handkerchief\nwith four orange circles.\nAnd he knew it was a hallucination.\nYou don\'t have handkerchiefs in midair.\nAnd then he saw a big wheel in midair.\nBut sometimes he wasn\'t sure whether he was hallucinating or not,\nbecause the hallucinations would fit\nin the context of the visions.\nSo on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them,\nhe said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"\nAnd they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."\nAnd then the handsome young men disappeared.\nIt\'s typical of these hallucinations\nthat they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.\nThey don\'t usually fade in and out.\nThey are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.'
p4277
aS'\nCharles Lullin, the grandfather,\nsaw hundreds of different figures,\ndifferent landscapes of all sorts.\nOn one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,\nand realized it was himself.\nThat was the only figure he recognized.\nOn one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris,\nhe saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.\nBut when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding\nsix inches high, on his study table.\nThis repetition of perception\nis sometimes called palinopsia.'
p4278
aS'\nWith him and with Rosalie,\nwhat seems to be going on --\nand Rosalie said, "What\'s going on?" --\nand I said that as you lose vision,\nas the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,\nthey become hyperactive and excitable,\nand they start to fire spontaneously.\nAnd you start to see things.\nThe things you see can be very complicated indeed.'
p4279
aS'\nWith another patient of mine,\nwho, also had some vision,\nthe vision she had could be disturbing.\nOn one occasion, she said she saw\na man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.\nAnd he turned around. And then\nhe divided into six figures in striped shirts,\nwho started walking towards her.\nAnd then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.\nOnce, when she was driving,\nor rather, her husband was driving,\nthe road divided into four\nand she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.'
p4280
aS'\nShe had very mobile hallucinations as well.\nA lot of them had to do with a car.\nSometimes she would see a teenage boy\nsitting on the hood of the car.\nHe was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully\nwhen the car turned.\nAnd then when they came to a stop,\nthe boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air,\nand then disappear.'
p4281
aS'\nAnother patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.\nThis was a woman who didn\'t have trouble with her eyes,\nbut the visual parts of her brain,\na little tumor in the occipital cortex.\nAnd, above all, she would see cartoons.\nThese cartoons would be transparent\nand would cover half the visual field, like a screen.\nAnd especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.\n(Laughter)\nNow, I don\'t watch Sesame Street,\nbut she made a point of saying,\n"Why Kermit?" She said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.\nYou know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.\nWhy Kermit?\nKermit the Frog means nothing to me."'
p4282
aS"\nShe didn't mind the cartoons too much.\nBut what did disturb her was she got very persistent\nimages or hallucinations of faces\nand as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,\nwith very large teeth or very large eyes.\nAnd these frightened her.\nWell, what is going on with these people?\nAs a physician, I have to try and define what's going on,\nand to reassure people,\nespecially to reassure them that they're not going insane."
p4283
aS'\nSomething like 10 percent, as I said,\nof visually impaired people get these.\nBut no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,\nbecause they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.\nAnd if they do mention them to their own doctors\nthey may be misdiagnosed.'
p4284
aS"\nIn particular, the notion is that if you see\nthings or hear things, you're going mad,\nbut the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.\nPsychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,\nthey address you. They accuse you.\nThey seduce you. They humiliate you.\nThey jeer at you.\nYou interact with them.\nThere is none of this quality of being addressed\nwith these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.\nThere is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you,\nor that's how people think about it."
p4285
aS"\nThere is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy,\nand sometimes, if one has this,\none may feel oneself transported back\nto a time and place in the past.\nYou're at a particular road junction.\nYou smell chestnuts roasting.\nYou hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.\nAnd you're waiting for your girl.\nAnd it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.\nAnd the temporal lobe hallucinations\nare all-sense hallucinations,\nfull of feeling, full of familiarity,\nlocated in space and time,\ncoherent, dramatic.\nThe Charles Bonnet ones are quite different."
p4286
aS'\nSo in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,\nyou have all sorts of levels,\nfrom the geometrical hallucinations --\nthe pink and blue squares the woman had --\nup to quite elaborate hallucinations\nwith figures and especially faces.\nFaces, and sometimes deformed faces,\nare the single commonest thing\nin these hallucinations.\nAnd one of the second commonest is cartoons.'
p4287
aS"\nSo, what is going on?\nFascinatingly, in the last few years,\nit's been possible to do functional brain imagery,\nto do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.\nAnd in fact, to find that different parts\nof the visual brain are activated\nas they are hallucinating.\nWhen people have these simple geometrical hallucinations,\nthe primary visual cortex is activated.\nThis is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.\nYou don't form images with your primary visual cortex."
p4288
aS"\nWhen images are formed,\na higher part of the visual cortex\nis involved in the temporal lobe.\nAnd in particular, one area of the temporal lobe\nis called the fusiform gyrus.\nAnd it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus,\nthey maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.\nBut if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus,\nthey may hallucinate faces,\nand this is exactly what you find in some of these people.\nThere is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus\nwhere teeth and eyes are represented,\nand that part of the gyrus is activated\nwhen people get the deformed hallucinations."
p4289
aS"\nThere is another part of the brain\nwhich is especially activated\nwhen one sees cartoons.\nIt's activated when one recognizes cartoons,\nwhen one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.\nIt's very interesting that that should be specific.\nThere are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved\nwith the recognition and hallucination\nof buildings and landscapes."
p4290
aS'\nAround 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,\nbut particular cells.\n"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.\nAnd now we know that there are hundreds of other\nsorts of cells,\nwhich can be very, very specific.\nSo you may not only have\n"car" cells,\nyou may have "Aston Martin" cells.\n(Laughter)\nI saw an Aston Martin this morning.\nI had to bring it in.\nAnd now it\'s in there somewhere.\n(Laughter)'
p4291
aS"\nNow, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex,\nthere are only visual images,\nor figments or fragments.\nIt's only at higher levels\nthat the other senses join in\nand there are connections with memory and emotion.\nAnd in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,\nyou don't go to those higher levels.\nYou're in these levels of inferior visual cortex\nwhere you have thousands and tens of thousands\nand millions of images,\nor figments, or fragmentary figments,\nall neurally encoded\nin particular cells or small clusters of cells."
p4292
aS"\nNormally these are all part of\nthe integrated stream of perception, or imagination,\nand one is not conscious of them.\nIt is only if one is visually impaired or blind\nthat the process is interrupted.\nAnd instead of getting normal perception,\nyou're getting an anarchic,\nconvulsive stimulation, or release,\nof all of these visual cells\nin the inferotemporal cortex.\nSo, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.\nSuddenly this, and suddenly that.\nThe mind does its best to organize\nand to give some sort of coherence to this,\nbut not terribly successfully."
p4293
aS'\nWhen these were first described,\nit was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.\nBut in fact people say,\n"I don\'t recognize the people. I can\'t form any associations."\n"Kermit means nothing to me."\nYou don\'t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.'
p4294
aS"\nWell, I've more or less said what I wanted.\nI think I just want to recapitulate\nand say this is common.\nThink of the number of blind people.\nThere must be hundreds of thousands of blind people\nwho have these hallucinations,\nbut are too scared to mention them.\nSo this sort of thing needs to be brought into\nnotice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.\nFinally, I think they are\ninfinitely interesting and valuable,\nfor giving one some insight as to how the brain works."
p4295
aS"\nCharles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --\nhe wondered how, thinking these hallucinations,\nhow, as he put it, the theater of the mind\ncould be generated by the machinery of the brain.\nNow, 250 years later,\nI think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.\nThanks very much."
p4296

aS'\nChris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.\nYou speak about these things with so much insight\nand empathy for your patients.\nHave you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?'
p4298
aS"\nOliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.\n(Laughter)\nWell, yeah, a lot of them.\nAnd actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.\nI'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.\nAnd I see the geometrical hallucinations.\nBut they stop there."
p4299

p4300
aS"\nOS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus,\nwhich I ignore.\nThey occasionally interest me,\nand I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.\nI've gone and had an fMRI myself,\nto see how my visual cortex is taking over.\nAnd when I see all these hexagons\nand complex things, which I also have,\nin visual migraine,\nI wonder whether everyone sees things like this,\nand whether things like cave art or ornamental art\nmay have been derived from them a bit."

S'\nI have a daughter, Mulan.\nAnd when she was eight, last year,\nshe was doing a report for school\nor she had some homework about frogs.\nAnd we were at this restaurant,\nand she said, "So, basically,\nfrogs lay eggs\nand the eggs turn into tadpoles,\nand tadpoles turn into frogs."'
p4305
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yeah. You know, I\'m not really up on my frog reproduction that much.\nIt\'s the females, I think, that lay the eggs,\nand then the males fertilize them.\nAnd then they become tadpoles and frogs."'

p4314
aS'\nAnd she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"'

p4319
aS'\nAnd then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.\n"Human males and females\ndevelop a special bond,\nand when they\'re much older, much, much older than you,\nand they have a very special feeling,\nthen they can be naked together."'
p4320
aS'\nAnd she said, "Mom,\nhave you done this before?"'
p4321
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yes."'
p4322
aS'\nAnd she said, "But Mom, you can\'t have kids."\nBecause she knows that I adopted her and that I can\'t have kids.'
p4323
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yes."'
p4324
aS'\nAnd she said, "Well, you don\'t have to do that again."'
p4325
aS'\nAnd I said, "..."'
p4326
aS'\nAnd then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?\nLike, how do they know that\'s the time?\nMom, does the man just say,\n\'Is now the time to take off my pants?\'"'
p4327
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4328
aS'\nAnd I said, "Yes."\n(Laughter)\n"That is exactly right.\nThat\'s exactly how it happens."'
p4329
aS'\nSo we\'re driving home and she\'s looking out the window, and she goes,\n"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,\nlike a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"'
p4330
aS'\nAnd I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.\nOh ..."'
p4331
aS'\nAnd then she goes, "What if there was like a party,\nand there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,\nand there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?\nWould that ever happen?"'
p4332
aS'\nAnd I said, "Oh, no, no.\nThat\'s not how we do it."'
p4333
aS'\nThen we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,\n"Mom, how do cats do it?"'
p4334
aS'\nAnd I go, "Oh, it\'s the same. It\'s basically the same."'
p4335
aS'\nAnd then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?\nI don\'t understand the legs."\nShe goes, "Mom, everyone can\'t do the splits."'
p4336
aS'\nAnd I go, "I know, but the legs ..."\nand I\'m probably like, "The legs get worked out."'
p4337
aS'\nAnd she goes, "But I just can\'t understand it."'
p4338
aS'\nSo I go, "You know, why don\'t we go on the Internet,\nand maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)'
p4339
aS'\nSo we go online, and we put in "cats mating."\nAnd, unfortunately, on YouTube, there\'s many cats mating videos.\nAnd we watched them and I\'m so thankful,\nbecause she\'s just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."\nShe goes, "What about dogs?"\nSo we put in dogs mating, and,\nyou know, we\'re watching it, and she\'s totally absorbed.'
p4340
aS'\nAnd then she goes, "Mom,\ndo you think they would have, on the Internet,\nany humans mating?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd then I realized that\nI had taken my little eight year old\'s hand,\nand taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)'
p4341
aS'\nAnd I looked into this\ntrusting, loving face,\nand I said,\n"Oh, no.\nThat would never happen."'

aa(lp4348
S"\n18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,\nso I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point\nwhere I get this thing to work.\nHere we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.\nI'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.\nI'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,\nand actually talk about this a bit more than we do.\nI'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.\nI'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic\nabout doing anything about aging.\nAnd then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk\ntalking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,\nnamely, by actually doing something about it."
p4349
aS"\nI'm going to do that in two steps.\nThe first one I'm going to talk about is\nhow to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --\nwhich I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people\nwho are already in middle-age when you start --\nto a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.\nNamely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between\nhow old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --\nor indeed, to get sick in the first place.\nAnd of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about\nis how to reach that intermediate step,\nthat point of maybe 30 years life extension."
p4350
aS"\nSo I'm going to start with why we should.\nNow, I want to ask a question.\nHands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?\nThat was easy. OK.\nOK. Hands up: anyone in the audience\nwho's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?\nOK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.\nThat's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.\nNow the thing is, I would like to put it to you\nthat the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing\nis because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.\nAnd here is that characteristic.\nThe only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does."
p4351
aS'\nNow, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,\nto talk about the comparison with foxhunting,\nwhich is something that was banned after a long struggle,\nby the government not very many months ago.\nI mean, I know I\'m with a sympathetic audience here,\nbut, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.\nAnd this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.\nYou know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,\ncity boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.\nIt\'s a traditional part of the way of life,\nand we should be allowed to carry on doing it.\nIt\'s ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."\nBut ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,\nbecause the majority of the British public,\nand certainly the majority of members of Parliament,\ncame to the conclusion that it was really something\nthat should not be tolerated in a civilized society.'
p4352
aS"\nAnd I think that human aging shares\nall of these characteristics in spades.\nWhat part of this do people not understand?\nIt's not just about life, of course --\n(Laughter) --\nit's about healthy life, you know --\ngetting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,\nwhether or not dying may be fun.\nSo really, this is how I would like to describe it.\nIt's a global trance.\nThese are the sorts of unbelievable excuses\nthat people give for aging.\nAnd, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying\nthat these excuses are completely valueless.\nThere are some good points to be made here,\nthings that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning\nso that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize\nthe turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging."
p4353
aS"\nBut these are completely crazy, when you actually\nremember your sense of proportion.\nYou know, these are arguments; these are things that\nwould be legitimate to be concerned about.\nBut the question is, are they so dangerous --\nthese risks of doing something about aging --\nthat they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,\nnamely, leaving aging as it is?\nAre these so bad that they outweigh\ncondemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?\nYou know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,\nthen just don't waste my time, is what I say.\n(Laughter)"
p4354
aS'\nNow, there is one argument\nthat some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.\nPeople worry about overpopulation; they say,\n"Well, if we fix aging, no one\'s going to die to speak of,\nor at least the death toll is going to be much lower,\nonly from crossing St. Giles carelessly.\nAnd therefore, we\'re not going to be able to have many kids,\nand kids are really important to most people."\nAnd that\'s true.\nAnd you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,\nand give answers like this.\nI don\'t agree with those answers. I think they basically don\'t work.\nI think it\'s true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.\nWe will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,\nor a high death rate.\nA high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,\nin favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.'
p4355
aS"\nAnd, I say that that's fine --\nthe future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.\nWhat's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.\nIf we vacillate, hesitate,\nand do not actually develop these therapies,\nthen we are condemning a whole cohort of people --\nwho would have been young enough and healthy enough\nto benefit from those therapies, but will not be,\nbecause we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --\nwe'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,\nand I consider that that is immoral.\nThat's my answer to the overpopulation question."
p4356
aS"\nRight. So the next thing is,\nnow why should we get a little bit more active on this?\nAnd the fundamental answer is that\nthe pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.\nIt's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.\nAging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,\nwe've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,\nand it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.\nLike, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons\nwhy aging is actually a good thing after all.\nBut of course, that only works when we have both of these components.\nAnd as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --\nand we might be in range of doing something about aging --\nthis becomes part of the problem.\nThis pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.\nAnd that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --\nevangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --\nin order to get people's attention, and make people realize\nthat they are in a trance in this regard.\nSo that's all I'm going to say about that."
p4357
aS"\nI'm now going to talk about feasibility.\nAnd the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable\nis summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.\nA very simple definition.\nAging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,\nwhich is to say, metabolism.\nThis is not a completely tautological statement;\nit's a reasonable statement.\nAging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,\nand it also happens to us,\ndespite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,\nbecause those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect."
p4358
aS'\nSo basically, metabolism, which is defined as\nbasically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,\nhas side effects.\nThose side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.\nThat\'s a fine definition. So we can put it this way:\nwe can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.\nAnd there are really two games in town,\naccording to most people, with regard to postponing aging.\nThey\'re what I\'m calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."\nThe geriatrician will intervene late in the day,\nwhen pathology is becoming evident,\nand the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,\nand stop the accumulation of side effects\nfrom causing the pathology quite so soon.\nOf course, it\'s a very short-term-ist strategy; it\'s a losing battle,\nbecause the things that are causing the pathology\nare becoming more abundant as time goes on.'
p4359
aS"\nThe gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,\nbecause, you know, prevention is better than cure.\nBut unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.\nIn fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --\neven cells we're not really too good on yet.\nWe've discovered things like, for example,\nRNA interference only a few years ago,\nand this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.\nBasically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,\nbut it is not an approach whose time has come\nwhen we're talking about intervention.\nSo then, what do we do about that?\nI mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,\npretty ironclad, doesn't it?"
p4360
aS'\nBut it isn\'t.\nBefore I tell you why it isn\'t, I\'m going to go a little bit\ninto what I\'m calling step two.\nJust suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --\nlet\'s say we do it today for the sake of argument --\nthe ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life\non people who are already in middle age, let\'s say 55.\nI\'m going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.\nWhat would that actually mean\nfor how long people of various ages today --\nor equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --\nwould actually live?\nIn order to answer that question -- you might think it\'s simple,\nbut it\'s not simple.\nWe can\'t just say, "Well, if they\'re young enough to benefit from these therapies,\nthen they\'ll live 30 years longer."\nThat\'s the wrong answer.\nAnd the reason it\'s the wrong answer is because of progress.'
p4361
aS"\nThere are two sorts of technological progress really,\nfor this purpose.\nThere are fundamental, major breakthroughs,\nand there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.\nNow, they differ a great deal\nin terms of the predictability of time frames.\nFundamental breakthroughs:\nvery hard to predict how long it's going to take\nto make a fundamental breakthrough.\nIt was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,\nand it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.\nBut after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.\nI think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened\nin the progression of the technology of powered flight.\nWe can think, really, that each one is sort of\nbeyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.\nThe incremental advances have added up to something\nwhich is not incremental anymore."
p4362
aS"\nThis is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.\nAnd you see it in all sorts of technologies.\nComputers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,\nhappening of course a bit later.\nYou can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --\nyou know, the same sort of time frame.\nSo I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,\nisn't a step at all.\nThat in fact, the people who are young enough\nto benefit from these first therapies\nthat give this moderate amount of life extension,\neven though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,\nwill be at some sort of cusp.\nThey will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments\nthat will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.\nIn other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.\nThe therapies will be improving faster than\nthe remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us."
p4363
aS'\nThis is a very important point for me to get across.\nBecause, you know, most people, when they hear\nthat I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,\nthey think that I\'m saying that we\'re going to invent therapies in the next few decades\nthat are so thoroughly eliminating aging\nthat those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.\nI\'m not saying that at all.\nI\'m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies\nwill be enough.\nThey\'ll never be perfect, but we\'ll be able to fix the things\nthat 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.\nAnd the same for 300 and 400 and so on.\nI decided to give this a little name,\nwhich is "longevity escape velocity."\n(Laughter)\nWell, it seems to get the point across.'
p4364
aS"\nSo, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,\nin terms of remaining life expectancy,\nas measured by their health,\nfor given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.\nIf you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --\nand an average 80-year-old,\nwe probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,\nbecause you're too close to death's door\nfor the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.\nYou won't be able to withstand them.\nBut if you're only 50, then there's a chance\nthat you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --\n(Laughter) --\neventually get through this\nand start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,\nin terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,\nand in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.\nAnd of course, if you're a bit younger than that,\nthen you're never really even going\nto get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes."
p4365
aS"\nSo this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --\nwe don't know how old that person is today,\nbecause we don't know how long it's going to take\nto get these first-generation therapies.\nBut irrespective of that age,\nI'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --\nsubject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --\nis actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.\nAnd that's quite a thought."
p4366
aS'\nAlright, so finally I\'m going to spend the rest of the talk,\nmy last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;\nnamely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension\nthat will allow us to get to escape velocity?\nAnd in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.\nI have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.\nI\'m calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.\nAnd this is what it is.\nI say we\'re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,\nwhich basically means mice that live about three years on average.\nWe do exactly nothing to them until they\'re already two years old.\nAnd then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,\nand with those therapies, we get them to live,\non average, to their fifth birthday.\nSo, in other words, we add two years --\nwe treble their remaining lifespan,\nstarting from the point that we started the therapies.'
p4367
aS"\nThe question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame\nuntil we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?\nWhich we can now, as I've explained,\nequivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.\nSecondly, what does it mean for the public's perception\nof how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,\nstarting from the time we get the mice?\nAnd thirdly, the question is, what will it do\nto actually how much people want it?\nAnd it seems to me that the first question\nis entirely a biology question,\nand it's extremely hard to answer.\nOne has to be very speculative,\nand many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,\nthat we should simply keep our counsel until we know more."
p4368
aS"\nI say that's nonsense.\nI say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.\nWe need to give our best guess as to the time frame,\nin order to give people a sense of proportion\nso that they can assess their priorities.\nSo, I say that we have a 50/50 chance\nof reaching this RHR milestone,\nrobust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point\nthat we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.\n15 years from the robust mouse.\nThe public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.\nThe public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.\nSo they'll probably think it's five years away.\nThey'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.\nAnd finally, of course, I think it's fair to say\nthat a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now\nis the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.\nThat will be history at this point,\nbecause it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,\nsince it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.\nSo we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,\nand of course that has enormous implications."
p4369
aS'\nSo in order to tell you now how we\'re going to get these mice,\nI\'m going to add a little bit to my description of aging.\nI\'m going to use this word "damage"\nto denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism\nand that eventually cause pathology.\nBecause the critical thing about this\nis that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,\nthe damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we\'re born.\nBut it is not part of metabolism itself.\nAnd this turns out to be useful.\nBecause we can re-draw our original diagram this way.\nWe can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics\nis that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate\nat which metabolism lays down this damage.\nAnd I\'m going to explain exactly what damage is\nin concrete biological terms in a moment.\nAnd geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time\nby stopping the damage converting into pathology.\nAnd the reason it\'s a losing battle\nis because the damage is continuing to accumulate.'
p4370
aS'\nSo there\'s a third approach, if we look at it this way.\nWe can call it the "engineering approach,"\nand I claim that the engineering approach is within range.\nThe engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.\nIt does not intervene in this process or this one.\nAnd that\'s good because it means that it\'s not a losing battle,\nand it\'s something that we are within range of being able to do,\nbecause it doesn\'t involve improving on evolution.\nThe engineering approach simply says,\n"Let\'s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --\nnot necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,\nso that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold\nthat must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."\nWe know that this threshold exists,\nbecause we don\'t get age-related diseases until we\'re in middle age,\neven though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.'
p4371
aS"\nWhy do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.\nThe point about this slide is actually the bottom.\nIf we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,\nwe will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism\nis important for aging in one way or another.\nThis list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.\nThe list on the right is also incomplete.\nIt's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,\nand it's just an incomplete list.\nBut I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --\nthis is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,\nside effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,\nor that might cause pathology.\nAnd there are only seven of them.\nThey're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.\nCell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on."
p4372
aS'\nFirst of all, I\'d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.\nOf course one can make a biological argument.\nOne can say, "OK, what are we made of?"\nWe\'re made of cells and stuff between cells.\nWhat can damage accumulate in?\nThe answer is: long-lived molecules,\nbecause if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --\nlike by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.\nIt\'s got to be long-lived molecules.\nSo, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago\nand that is pretty good news, because it means that,\nyou know, we\'ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years,\nso the fact that we haven\'t extended this list\nis a pretty good indication that there\'s no extension to be done.\nHowever, it\'s better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,\nin mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,\nwe probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.\nSome of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.'
p4373
aS"\nI haven't got time to go through them at all, but\nmy conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,\nthen we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,\nbut we do need to get serious about it.\nWe do need to really start trying.\nSo of course, there are some biologists in the audience,\nand I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.\nYou may have been dissatisfied with this talk,\nbut fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.\nI've published a great deal on this;\nI cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,\nand there's quite a lot of detail there.\nThe detail is what makes me confident\nof my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.\nSo if you think that I'm wrong,\nyou'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong."
p4374
aS"\nAnd of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people\nwho call themselves gerontologists because,\nas with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,\nyou know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant\nand not really to take it seriously.\nSo, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,\nin order to understand whether this is true."
p4375
aS'\nAnd we\'ll just end with a few things.\nOne thing is, you know, you\'ll be hearing from a guy in the next session\nwho said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,\nand everyone said, "Well, it\'s obviously impossible."\nAnd you know what happened.\nSo, you know, this does happen.\nWe have various strategies -- there\'s the Methuselah Mouse Prize,\nwhich is basically an incentive to innovate,\nand to do what you think is going to work,\nand you get money for it if you win.\nThere\'s a proposal to actually put together an institute.\nThis is what\'s going to take a bit of money.\nBut, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?\nNot very long. OK.\n(Laughter)\nIt\'s got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,\nbut it\'s basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.\nAnd I think we know how to do it. And I\'ll stop there.\nThank you.\n(Applause)'
p4376
aS"\nChris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions\nbut I thought I would give people the chance.\nAudience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,\nwhy is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?\n(Laughter)"
p4377
aS'\nAG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)'
p4378
aS'\nAudience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems\nto fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.\nHowever, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,\nso when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.\nSo, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,\nwhen it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?'
p4379
aS"\nAG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question\nthat I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.\nI'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,\nwhich I happen to agree with,\nwhich is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;\n[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.\nIn other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;\nyou need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes\nin order to age more slowly,\nand that carries on being true the longer you push it out.\nSo, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,\ndoesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,\nliving a long time or by procreation,\nthere's a certain amount of modulation of that,\nwhich is why different species have different lifespans,\nbut that's why there are no immortal species."

p4381
aS"\nAG: That's right."
p4382
aS"\nAudience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,\nthe average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.\nIf I project that, that would make me think\nthat I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.\nThat means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?"
p4383
aS"\nAG: If you lose a bit of weight.\n(Laughter)\nYour numbers are a bit out.\nThe standard numbers are that lifespans\nhave been growing at between one and two years per decade.\nSo, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.\nBut I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible."
p4384
aS'\nAudience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults\nare actually in the human embryo,\nand that the brain cells last 80 years or so.\nIf that is indeed true,\nbiologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?\nIf there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,\nas opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?'
p4385
aS"\nAG: There are technical implications certainly.\nBasically what we need to do is replace cells\nin those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,\nespecially neurons, but we don't want to replace them\nany faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,\nbecause replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.\nWhat I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on\nwas a little bit of an oversimplification.\nThere are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --\nbut they do it by not having a nervous system --\nand not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function\non very long-lived cells."

S"\nThree and a half years ago,\nI made one of the best decisions of my life.\nAs my New Year's resolution,\nI gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,\nand learned to eat mindfully.\nNow I eat whenever I'm hungry,\nand I've lost 10 pounds."
p4388
aS"\nThis was me at age 13,\nwhen I started my first diet.\nI look at that picture now, and I think,\nyou did not need a diet,\nyou needed a fashion consult.\n(Laughter)\nBut I thought I needed to lose weight,\nand when I gained it back,\nof course I blamed myself.\nAnd for the next three decades,\nI was on and off various diets.\nNo matter what I tried,\nthe weight I'd lost always came back.\nI'm sure many of you know the feeling."
p4389
aS"\nAs a neuroscientist,\nI wondered, why is this so hard?\nObviously, how much you weigh depends on\nhow much you eat and how much energy you burn.\nWhat most people don't realize\nis that hunger and energy use\nare controlled by the brain,\nmostly without your awareness.\nYour brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,\nand that is a good thing,\nbecause your conscious mind --\nhow do we put this politely? --\nit's easily distracted.\nIt's good that you don't have to remember to breathe\nwhen you get caught up in a movie.\nYou don't forget how to walk\nbecause you're thinking about\nwhat to have for dinner."
p4390
aS"\nYour brain also has its own sense\nof what you should weigh,\nno matter what you consciously believe.\nThis is called your set point,\nbut that's a misleading term,\nbecause it's actually a range\nof about 10 or 15 pounds.\nYou can use lifestyle choices to move your weight\nup and down within that range,\nbut it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.\nThe hypothalamus, the part of the brain\nthat regulates body weight,\nthere are more than a dozen chemical signals\nin the brain that tell your body to gain weight,\nmore than another dozen that\ntell your body to lose it,\nand the system works like a thermostat,\nresponding to signals from the body\nby adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,\nto keep your weight stable as conditions change.\nThat's what a thermostat does, right?\nIt keeps the temperature in your house the same\nas the weather changes outside.\nNow you can try to change the temperature\nin your house by opening a window in the winter,\nbut that's not going to change\nthe setting on the thermostat,\nwhich will respond by kicking on the furnace\nto warm the place back up.\nYour brain works exactly the same way,\nresponding to weight loss by using powerful tools\nto push your body back\nto what it considers normal.\nIf you lose a lot of weight,\nyour brain reacts as if you were starving,\nand whether you started out fat or thin,\nyour brain's response is exactly the same.\nWe would love to think that your brain could tell\nwhether you need to lose weight or not,\nbut it can't.\nIf you do lose a lot of weight,\nyou become hungry,\nand your muscles burn less energy.\nDr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University\nhas found that people who have lost\n10 percent of their body weight\nburn 250 to 400 calories less\nbecause their metabolism is suppressed.\nThat's a lot of food.\nThis means that a successful dieter\nmust eat this much less forever\nthan someone of the same weight\nwho has always been thin."
p4391
aS"\nFrom an evolutionary perspective,\nyour body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.\nWhen food was scarce, our ancestors' survival\ndepended on conserving energy,\nand regaining the weight when food was available\nwould have protected them\nagainst the next shortage.\nOver the course of human history,\nstarvation has been a much bigger problem\nthan overeating.\nThis may explain a very sad fact:\nSet points can go up,\nbut they rarely go down.\nNow, if your mother ever mentioned\nthat life is not fair,\nthis is the kind of thing she was talking about.\n(Laughter)\nSuccessful dieting doesn't lower your set point.\nEven after you've kept the weight off\nfor as long as seven years,\nyour brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.\nIf that weight loss had been due to a long famine,\nthat would be a sensible response.\nIn our modern world of drive-thru burgers,\nit's not working out so well for many of us.\nThat difference between our ancestral past\nand our abundant present\nis the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff\nof the University of Ottawa\nwould like to take some of his patients back to a time\nwhen food was less available,\nand it's also the reason\nthat changing the food environment\nis really going to be the most effective solution\nto obesity."
p4392
aS"\nSadly, a temporary weight gain\ncan become permanent.\nIf you stay at a high weight for too long,\nprobably a matter of years for most of us,\nyour brain may decide that that's the new normal."
p4393
aS"\nPsychologists classify eaters into two groups,\nthose who rely on their hunger\nand those who try to control their eating\nthrough willpower, like most dieters.\nLet's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.\nThe interesting thing is that intuitive eaters\nare less likely to be overweight,\nand they spend less time thinking about food.\nControlled eaters are more vulnerable\nto overeating in response to advertising,\nsuper-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.\nAnd a small indulgence,\nlike eating one scoop of ice cream,\nis more likely to lead to a food binge\nin controlled eaters.\nChildren are especially vulnerable\nto this cycle of dieting and then binging.\nSeveral long-term studies have shown\nthat girls who diet in their early teenage years\nare three times more likely to become overweight\nfive years later,\neven if they started at a normal weight,\nand all of these studies found\nthat the same factors\nthat predicted weight gain\nalso predicted the development of eating disorders.\nThe other factor, by the way,\nthose of you who are parents,\nwas being teased by family members\nabout their weight.\nSo don't do that.\n(Laughter)"
p4394
aS"\nI left almost all my graphs at home,\nbut I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,\nbecause I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.\n(Laughter)\nThis is a study that looked at the risk of death\nover a 14-year period\nbased on four healthy habits:\neating enough fruits and vegetables,\nexercise three times a week,\nnot smoking,\nand drinking in moderation.\nLet's start by looking at the normal weight\npeople in the study.\nThe height of the bars is the risk of death,\nand those zero, one, two, three, four numbers\non the horizontal axis\nare the number of those healthy habits\nthat a given person had.\nAnd as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,\nthe less likely people were to die during the study.\nNow let's look at what happens\nin overweight people.\nThe ones that had no healthy habits\nhad a higher risk of death.\nAdding just one healthy habit\npulls overweight people back into the normal range.\nFor obese people with no healthy habits,\nthe risk is very high, seven times higher\nthan the healthiest groups in the study.\nBut a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.\nIn fact, if you look only at the group\nwith all four healthy habits,\nyou can see that weight makes very little difference.\nYou can take control of your health\nby taking control of your lifestyle,\neven If you can't lose weight\nand keep it off."
p4395
aS"\nDiets don't have very much reliability.\nFive years after a diet,\nmost people have regained the weight.\nForty percent of them have gained even more.\nIf you think about this,\nthe typical outcome of dieting\nis that you're more likely to gain weight\nin the long run than to lose it."
p4396
aS"\nIf I've convinced you that dieting\nmight be a problem,\nthe next question is, what do you do about it?\nAnd my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.\nI'm not saying you need to learn to meditate\nor take up yoga.\nI'm talking about mindful eating:\nlearning to understand your body's signals\nso that you eat when you're hungry\nand stop when you're full,\nbecause a lot of weight gain boils down\nto eating when you're not hungry.\nHow do you do it?\nGive yourself permission to eat\nas much as you want, and then work on figuring out\nwhat makes your body feel good.\nSit down to regular meals without distractions.\nThink about how your body feels\nwhen you start to eat and when you stop,\nand let your hunger decide\nwhen you should be done.\nIt took about a year for me to learn this,\nbut it's really been worth it.\nI am so much more relaxed around food\nthan I have ever been in my life.\nI often don't think about it.\nI forget we have chocolate in the house.\nIt's like aliens have taken over my brain.\nIt's just completely different.\nI should say that\nthis approach to eating probably\nwon't make you lose weight\nunless you often eat when you're not hungry,\nbut doctors don't know of any approach\nthat makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,\nand that is why a lot of people are now focusing on\npreventing weight gain\ninstead of promoting weight loss.\nLet's face it:\nIf diets worked, we'd all be thin already.\n(Laughter)\nWhy do we keep doing the same thing\nand expecting different results?\nDiets may seem harmless,\nbut they actually do a lot of collateral damage.\nAt worst, they ruin lives:\nWeight obsession leads to eating disorders,\nespecially in young kids.\nIn the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls\nsay they've been on a diet.\nOur daughters have learned to measure their worth\nby the wrong scale.\nEven at its best,\ndieting is a waste of time and energy.\nIt takes willpower which you could be using\nto help your kids with their homework\nor to finish that important work project,\nand because willpower is limited,\nany strategy that relies on its consistent application\nis pretty much guaranteed\nto eventually fail you\nwhen your attention moves on to something else."
p4397
aS"\nLet me leave you with one last thought.\nWhat if we told all those dieting girls\nthat it's okay to eat when they're hungry?\nWhat if we taught them to work with their appetite\ninstead of fearing it?\nI think most of them would be happier and healthier,\nand as adults,\nmany of them would probably be thinner.\nI wish someone had told me that\nback when I was 13."

S"\nWhy do so many people reach success and then fail?\nOne of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.\nSo we do everything that leads up to success,\nbut then we get there. We figure we've made it,\nwe sit back in our comfort zone,\nand we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.\nAnd it doesn't take long to go downhill.\nAnd I can tell you this happens,\nbecause it happened to me."
p4402
aS'\nReaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.\nBut then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.\nI can just sit back and relax."'
p4403
aS'\nReaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.\nBut then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I\'m good enough.\nI don\'t need to improve any more."'
p4404
aS"\nReaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.\nBecause I did all these simple things that led to ideas.\nBut then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy\nand I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.\nAnd the only thing that came was creative block.\nI couldn't come up with any ideas."
p4405
aS'\nReaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,\nand ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.\nAnd I got distracted by it.\nAnd suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,\nwhen I should have been talking to my clients.'
p4406
aS"\nAnd reaching success, I always did what I loved.\nBut then I got into stuff that I didn't love,\nlike management. I am the world's worst manager,\nbut I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,\nthe president of the company."
p4407
aS"\nWell, soon a black cloud formed over my head\nand here I was, outwardly very successful,\nbut inwardly very depressed.\nBut I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.\nI bought a fast car.\n(Laughter)\nIt didn't help.\nI was faster but just as depressed."
p4408
aS'\nSo I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,\nI can buy anything I want. But I\'m not happy. I\'m depressed.\nIt\'s true what they say, and I didn\'t believe it until it happened to me.\nBut money can\'t buy happiness."\nHe said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."\nAnd he put me on anti-depressants.\nAnd yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,\nbecause I was just floating along. I couldn\'t care less if clients ever called.\n(Laughter)'
p4409
aS"\nAnd clients didn't call.\n(Laughter)\nBecause they could see I was no longer serving them,\nI was only serving myself.\nSo they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better."
p4410
aS"\nWell, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.\nMy partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.\nIt was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.\nAnd that was great.\nBecause with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage."
p4411
aS"\nSo I went back to doing the projects I loved.\nI had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,\ndid all the things that took me back up to success.\nBut it wasn't a quick trip.\nIt took seven years."
p4412
aS'\nBut in the end, business grew bigger than ever.\nAnd when I went back to following these eight principles,\nthe black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.\nAnd I woke up one day and I said,\n"I don\'t need Prozac anymore."\nAnd I threw it away and haven\'t needed it since.'
p4413
aS'\nI learned that success isn\'t a one-way street.\nIt doesn\'t look like this; it really looks more like this.\nIt\'s a continuous journey.\nAnd if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"\nwe just keep following these eight principles,\nbecause that is not only how we achieve success,\nit\'s how we sustain it.\nSo here is to your continued success.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause)'

S"\nHi, my name is Frank,\nand I collect secrets.\nIt all started with a crazy idea\nin November of 2004.\nI printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,\njust like this.\nThey were blank on one side,\nand on the other side\nI listed some simple instructions.\nI asked people to anonymously share an artful secret\nthey'd never told anyone before.\nAnd I handed out these postcards randomly\non the streets of Washington, D.C.,\nnot knowing what to expect."

p4418
aS'\n"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.\nI\'ve found love. I\'m happy."\nSecrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,\nof frailty and heroism,\nplaying out silently\nin the lives of people all around us\neven now.\n"Everyone who knew me before 9/11\nbelieves I\'m dead."\n"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,\nso sometimes I didn\'t wear panties,\nand just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."'

aS'\nThis next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.\nI love to speak on college campuses\nand share secrets and the stories with students.\nAnd sometimes afterwards I\'ll stick around\nand sign books and take photos with students.\nAnd this next postcard was made\nout of one of those photos.\nAnd I should also mention that, just like today,\nat that PostSecret event,\nI was using a wireless microphone.\n"Your mic wasn\'t off during sound check.\nWe all heard you pee."\n(Laughter)\nThis was really embarrassing when it happened,\nuntil I realized it could have been worse.\nRight.

aS'\n"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,\nwell, I was getting your ring.\nIt\'s in my pocket right now."\nI had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog\ntwo years ago on Valentine\'s Day.\nIt was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.\nAnd it hadn\'t been up for more than a couple hours\nbefore I received this exuberant email\nfrom the guy who mailed me this postcard.'
p4425
aS'\nAnd he said, "Frank, I\'ve got to share with you\nthis story that just played out in my life."\nHe said, "My knees are still shaking."\nHe said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,\nwe\'ve made it this Sunday morning ritual\nto visit the PostSecret blog together\nand read the secrets out loud.\nI read some to her, she reads some to me."\nHe says, "It\'s really brought us closer together\nthrough the years.'
p4426
aS'\nAnd so when I discovered\nthat you had posted\nmy surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,\nI was beside myself.\nAnd I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.\nAnd just like every Sunday,\nwe started reading the secrets out loud to each other."\nHe said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever\nto get through each one."\nBut she finally did.\nShe got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.\nAnd he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."\nAnd she turned to him and said,\n"Is that our cat?"\n(Laughter)\nAnd when she saw him,\nhe was down on one knee, he had the ring out.\nHe popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.'

aS'\nA year later I found myself at MIT\nin the robotic life group, it was one of the first groups\nresearching the relationships \nbetween humans and robots.\nAnd I still had this dream to make\nan actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.\nBut I found that robots didn\'t move at all\nin this engaging way that I was used to\nfor my animation studies.\nInstead, they were all --\nhow should I put it, they were all kind of robotic.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I thought, what if I took whatever \nI learned in animation school,\nand used that to design my robotic desk lamp.\nSo I went and designed frame by frame\nto try to make this robot\nas graceful and engaging as possible.\nAnd here when you see the robot interacting with me\non a desktop.\nAnd I\'m actually redesigning the robot so,\nunbeknownst to itself,\nit\'s kind of digging its own grave by helping me.\n(Laughter)\nI wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure\ngiving me light,\nand more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice\nthat\'s always there when you need \nit and doesn\'t really interfere.\nAnd when, for example, I\'m looking for a battery\nthat I can\'t find,\nin a subtle way, it will show me where the battery is.\nSo you can see my confusion here.\nI\'m not an actor.\nAnd I want you to notice how the same\nmechanical structure can at one point,\njust by the way it moves seem gentle and caring --\nand in the other case, seem \nviolent and confrontational.\nAnd it\'s the same structure, \njust the motion is different.\nActor: "You want to know something? \nWell, you want to know something?\nHe was already dead!\nJust laying there, eyes glazed over!"\n(Laughter)\nBut, moving in graceful ways is just one \nbuilding block of this whole structure\ncalled human-robot interaction.\nI was at the time doing my Ph.D.,\nI was working on human robot teamwork;\nteams of humans and robots working together.\nI was studying the engineering,\nthe psychology, the philosophy of teamwork.\nAnd at the same time I found myself\nin my own kind of teamwork situation\nwith a good friend of mine who is actually here.\nAnd in that situation we can easily imagine robots\nin the near future being there with us.\nIt was after a Passover seder.\nWe were folding up a lot of folding chairs,\nand I was amazed at how quickly \nwe found our own rhythm.\nEverybody did their own part.\nWe didn\'t have to divide our tasks.\nWe didn\'t have to communicate verbally about this.\nIt all just happened.\nAnd I thought,\nhumans and robots don\'t look at all like this.\nWhen humans and robots interact,\nit\'s much more like a chess game.\nThe human does a thing,\nthe robot analyzes whatever the human did,\nthen the robot decides what to do next,\nplans it and does it.\nAnd then the human waits, until it\'s their turn again.\nSo, it\'s much more like a chess game\nand that makes sense because chess is great\nfor mathematicians and computer scientists.\nIt\'s all about information analysis,\ndecision making and planning.'
p4469
aS'\nBut I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player,\nand more like a doer\nthat just clicks and works together.\nSo I made my second horrible career choice:\nI decided to study acting for a semester.\nI took off from a Ph.D. I went to acting classes.\nI actually participated in a play,\nI hope theres no video of that around still.\nAnd I got every book I could find about acting,\nincluding one from the 19th century\nthat I got from the library.\nAnd I was really amazed because my \nname was the second name on the list --\nthe previous name was in 1889. (Laughter)\nAnd this book was kind of waiting for 100 years\nto be rediscovered for robotics.\nAnd this book shows actors\nhow to move every muscle in the body\nto match every kind of emotion \nthat they want to express.'
p4470
aS'\nBut the real revelation was\nwhen I learned about method acting.\nIt became very popular in the 20th century.\nAnd method acting said, you don\'t have \nto plan every muscle in your body.\nInstead you have to use your body \nto find the right movement.\nYou have to use your sense memory\nto reconstruct the emotions and kind of\nthink with your body to find the right expression.\nImprovise, play off yor scene partner.\nAnd this came at the same time \nas I was reading about this trend\nin cognitive psychology called embodied cognition.\nWhich also talks about the same ideas --\nWe use our bodies to think,\nwe don\'t just think with our brains \nand use our bodies to move.\nbut our bodies feed back into our brain\nto generate the way that we behave.\nAnd it was like a lightning bolt.\nI went back to my office.\nI wrote this paper -- which I never really published\ncalled "Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence."\nAnd I even took another month\nto do what was then the first theater play\nwith a human and a robot acting together.\nThat\'s what you saw before with the actors.\nAnd I thought:\nHow can we make an artificial intelligence model --\ncomputer, computational model --\nthat will model some of these ideas of improvisation,\nof taking risks, of taking chances,\neven of making mistakes.\nMaybe it can make for better robotic teammates.\nSo I worked for quite a long time on these models\nand I implemented them on a number of robots.\nHere you can see a very early example\nwith the robots trying to use this \nembodied artificial intelligence,\nto try to match my movements \nas closely as possible,\nsort of like a game.\nLet\'s look at it.\nYou can see when I psych it out, it gets fooled.\nAnd it\'s a little bit like what you might see actors do\nwhen they try to mirror each other\nto find the right synchrony between them.\nAnd then, I did another experiment,\nand I got people off the street \nto use the robotic desk lamp,\nand try out this idea of embodied \nartificial intelligence.\nSo, I actually used two kinds \nof brains for the same robot.\nThe robot is the same lamp that you saw,\nand I put in it two brains.\nFor one half of the people,\nI put in a brain that\'s kind of the traditional,\ncalculated robotic brain.\nIt waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans.\nLet\'s call it the calculated brain.\nThe other got more the stage actor, risk taker brain.\nLet\'s call it the adventurous brain.\nIt sometimes acts without knowing \neverything it has to know.\nIt sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them.\nAnd I had them do this very tedious task\nthat took almost 20 minutes\nand they had to work together.\nSomehow simulating like a factory job\nof repetitively doing the same thing.\nAnd what I found was that people actually loved\nthe adventurous robot.\nAnd they thought it was more intelligent,\nmore committed, a better member of the team,\ncontributed to the success of the team more.\nThey even called it \'he\' and \'she,\'\nwhereas people with the calculated brain called it \'it.\'\nAnd nobody ever called it \'he\' or \'she\'.\nWhen they talked about it after the task\nwith the adventurous brain,\nthey said, "By the end, we were good \nfriends and high-fived mentally."\nWhatever that means.\n(Laughter) Sounds painful.\nWhereas the people with the calculated brain\nsaid it was just like a lazy apprentice.\nIt only did what it was supposed \nto do and nothing more.\nWhich is almost what people expect robots to do,\nso I was surprised that people \nhad higher expectations\nof robots, than what anybody in robotics \nthought robots should be doing.\nAnd in a way, I thought, maybe it\'s time --\njust like method acting changed the way\npeople thought about acting in the 19th century,\nfrom going from the very calculated,\nplanned way of behaving,\nto a more intuitive, risk-taking, \nembodied way of behaving.\nMaybe it\'s time for robots\nto have the same kind of revolution.'
p4471
aS"\nA few years later,\nI was at my next research job \nat Georgia Tech in Atlanta,\nand I was working in a group\ndealing with robotic musicians.\nAnd I thought, music, that's the perfect place\nto look at teamwork, coordination,\ntiming, improvisation --\nand we just got this robot playing marimba.\nMarimba, for everybody who was like me,\nit was this huge, wooden xylophone.\nAnd, when I was looking at this,\nI looked at other works in \nhuman-robot improvisation --\nyes, there are other works in \nhuman-robot improvisation --\nand they were also a little bit like a chess game.\nThe human would play,\nthe robot would analyze what was played,\nwould improvise their own part.\nSo, this is what musicians called\na call and response interaction,\nand it also fits very well, robots \nand artificial intelligence.\nBut I thought, if I use the same ideas I used\nin the theater play and in the teamwork studies,\nmaybe I can make the robots jam together\nlike a band.\nEverybody's riffing off each other, \nnobody is stopping it for a moment.\nAnd so, I tried to do the same \nthings, this time with music,\nwhere the robot doesn't really know\nwhat it's about to play.\nIt just sort of moves its body\nand uses opportunities to play,\nAnd does what my jazz teacher\nwhen I was 17 taught me.\nShe said, when you improvise,\nsometimes you don't know what you're doing\nand you're still doing it.\nAnd so I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually\nknow what it's doing, but it's still doing it.\nSo let's look at a few seconds \nfrom this performance.\nWhere the robot listens to the human musician\nand improvises.\nAnd then, look at how the human musician also\nresponds to what the robot is doing, and picking up\nfrom its behavior.\nAnd at some point can even be surprised \nby what the robot came up with.\n(Music)\n(Applause)"
p4472
aS"\nBeing a musician is not just about making notes,\notherwise nobody would ever go see a live show.\nMusicians also communicate with their bodies,\nwith other band members, with the audience,\nthey use their bodies to express the music.\nAnd I thought, we already have \na robot musician on stage,\nwhy not make it be a full-fledged musician.\nAnd I started designing a socially expressive head\nfor the robot.\nThe head does't actually touch the marimba,\nit just expresses what the music is like.\nThese are some napkin sketches \nfrom a bar in Atlanta,\nthat was dangerously located exactly halfway\nbetween my lab and my home. (Laughter)\nSo I spent, I would say on average,\nthree to four hours a day there.\nI think. (Laughter)\nAnd I went back to my animation \ntools and tried to figure out\nnot just what a robotic musician would look like,\nbut especially what a robotic \nmusician would move like.\nTo sort of show that it doesn't like \nwhat the other person is playing --\nand maybe show whatever beat it's feeling\nat the moment."
p4473
aS"\nSo we ended up actually getting the money \nto build this robot, which was nice.\nI'm going to show you now the \nsame kind of performance,\nthis time with a socially expressive head.\nAnd notice one thing --\nhow the robot is really showing us\nthe beat it's picking up from the human.\nWe're also giving the human a sense \nthat the robot knows what it's doing.\nAnd also how it changes the way it moves\nas soon as it starts its own solo.\n(Music)\nNow it's looking at me to make sure I'm listening.\n(Music)\nAnd now look at the final chord of the piece again,\nand this time the robot communicates with its body\nwhen it's busy doing its own thing.\nAnd when it's ready\nto coordinate the final chord with me.\n(Music)\n(Applause)"
p4474
aS"\nThanks. I hope you see how much this totally not --\nhow much this part of the body \nthat doesn't touch the instrument\nactually helps with the musical performance.\nAnd at some point, we are in Atlanta, \nso obviously some rapper\nwill come into our lab at some point.\nAnd we had this rapper come in\nand do a little jam with the robot.\nAnd here you can see the robot\nbasically responding to the beat and --\nnotice two things. One, how irresistible it is\nto join the robot while it's moving its head.\nand you kind of want to move \nyour own head when it does it.\nAnd second, even though the rapper \nis really focused on his iPhone,\nas soon as the robot turns to him, he turns back.\nSo even though it's just in \nthe periphery of his vision --\nit's just in the corner of his eye -- \nit's very powerful.\nAnd the reason is that we can't ignore\nphysical things moving in our environment.\nWe are wired for that.\nSo, if you have a problem with maybe your partners\nlooking at the iPhone too much \nor their smartphone too much,\nyou might want to have a robot there\nto get their attention. (Laughter)\n(Music)\n(Applause)"
p4475
aS'\nJust to introduce the last robot\nthat we\'ve worked on,\nthat came out of something kind \nof surprising that we found:\nAt some point people didn\'t care anymore \nabout the robot being so intelligent,\nand can improvise and listen,\nand do all these embodied intelligence \nthings that I spent years on developing.\nThey really liked that the robot was \nenjoying the music. (Laughter)\nAnd they didn\'t say that the \nrobot was moving to the music,\nthey said that the robot was enjoying the music.\nAnd we thought, why don\'t we take this idea,\nand I designed a new piece of furniture.\nThis time it wasn\'t a desk \nlamp; it was a speaker dock.\nIt was one of those things you \nplug your smartphone in.\nAnd I thought, what would happen\nif your speaker dock didn\'t \njust play the music for you,\nbut it would actually enjoy it too. (Laughter)\nAnd so again, here are some animation tests\nfrom an early stage. (Laughter)\nAnd this is what the final product looked like.\n("Drop It Like It\'s Hot")\nSo, a lot of bobbing head.\n(Applause)\nA lot of bobbing heads in the audience,\nso we can still see robots influence people.\nAnd it\'s not just fun and games.'
p4476
aS"\nI think one of the reasons I care so much\nabout robots that use their body to communicate\nand use their body to move --\nand I'm going to let you in on a little \nsecret we roboticists are hiding --\nis that every one of you is \ngoing to be living with a robot\nat some point in their life.\nSomewhere in your future there's \ngoing to be a robot in your life.\nAnd if not in yours, then in your children's lives.\nAnd I want these robots to be --\nto be more fluent, more engaging, more graceful\nthan currently they seem to be.\nAnd for that I think that maybe robots\nneed to be less like chess players\nand more like stage actors and more like musicians.\nMaybe they should be able to \ntake chances and improvise.\nAnd maybe they should be able to \nanticipate what you're about to do.\nAnd maybe they need to be able to make mistakes\nand correct them,\nbecause in the end we are human.\nAnd maybe as humans, robots \nthat are a little less than perfect\nare just perfect for us.\nThank you.\n(Applause)"

aa(lp4478
S'\nJust a moment ago,\nmy daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.\nHer text said,\n"Mom, you will rock."\nI love this.\nGetting that text\nwas like getting a hug.\nAnd so there you have it.\nI embody\nthe central paradox.\nI\'m a woman\nwho loves getting texts\nwho\'s going to tell you\nthat too many of them can be a problem.'
p4479
aS'\nActually that reminder of my daughter\nbrings me to the beginning of my story.\n1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,\nRebecca was five years old\nand she was sitting right there\nin the front row.\nI had just written a book\nthat celebrated our life on the internet\nand I was about to be on the cover\nof Wired magazine.\nIn those heady days,\nwe were experimenting\nwith chat rooms and online virtual communities.\nWe were exploring different aspects of ourselves.\nAnd then we unplugged.\nI was excited.\nAnd, as a psychologist, what excited me most\nwas the idea\nthat we would use what we learned in the virtual world\nabout ourselves, about our identity,\nto live better lives in the real world.'
p4480
aS"\nNow fast-forward to 2012.\nI'm back here on the TED stage again.\nMy daughter's 20. She's a college student.\nShe sleeps with her cellphone,\nso do I.\nAnd I've just written a new book,\nbut this time it's not one\nthat will get me on the cover\nof Wired magazine.\nSo what happened?\nI'm still excited by technology,\nbut I believe,\nand I'm here to make the case,\nthat we're letting it take us places\nthat we don't want to go."
p4481
aS"\nOver the past 15 years,\nI've studied technologies of mobile communication\nand I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,\nyoung and old,\nabout their plugged in lives.\nAnd what I've found\nis that our little devices,\nthose little devices in our pockets,\nare so psychologically powerful\nthat they don't only change what we do,\nthey change who we are.\nSome of the things we do now with our devices\nare things that, only a few years ago,\nwe would have found odd\nor disturbing,\nbut they've quickly come to seem familiar,\njust how we do things."
p4482
aS"\nSo just to take some quick examples:\nPeople text or do email\nduring corporate board meetings.\nThey text and shop and go on Facebook\nduring classes, during presentations,\nactually during all meetings.\nPeople talk to me about the important new skill\nof making eye contact\nwhile you're texting.\n(Laughter)\nPeople explain to me\nthat it's hard, but that it can be done.\nParents text and do email\nat breakfast and at dinner\nwhile their children complain\nabout not having their parents' full attention.\nBut then these same children\ndeny each other their full attention.\nThis is a recent shot\nof my daughter and her friends\nbeing together\nwhile not being together.\nAnd we even text at funerals.\nI study this.\nWe remove ourselves\nfrom our grief or from our revery\nand we go into our phones."
p4483
aS"\nWhy does this matter?\nIt matters to me\nbecause I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --\ntrouble certainly\nin how we relate to each other,\nbut also trouble\nin how we relate to ourselves\nand our capacity for self-reflection.\nWe're getting used to a new way\nof being alone together.\nPeople want to be with each other,\nbut also elsewhere --\nconnected to all the different places they want to be.\nPeople want to customize their lives.\nThey want to go in and out of all the places they are\nbecause the thing that matters most to them\nis control over where they put their attention.\nSo you want to go to that board meeting,\nbut you only want to pay attention\nto the bits that interest you.\nAnd some people think that's a good thing.\nBut you can end up\nhiding from each other,\neven as we're all constantly connected to each other."
p4484
aS'\nA 50-year-old business man\nlamented to me\nthat he feels he doesn\'t have colleagues anymore at work.\nWhen he goes to work, he doesn\'t stop by to talk to anybody,\nhe doesn\'t call.\nAnd he says he doesn\'t want to interrupt his colleagues\nbecause, he says, "They\'re too busy on their email."\nBut then he stops himself\nand he says, "You know, I\'m not telling you the truth.\nI\'m the one who doesn\'t want to be interrupted.\nI think I should want to,\nbut actually I\'d rather just do things on my Blackberry."'
p4485
aS'\nAcross the generations,\nI see that people can\'t get enough of each other,\nif and only if\nthey can have each other at a distance,\nin amounts they can control.\nI call it the Goldilocks effect:\nnot too close, not too far,\njust right.\nBut what might feel just right\nfor that middle-aged executive\ncan be a problem for an adolescent\nwho needs to develop face-to-face relationships.\nAn 18-year-old boy\nwho uses texting for almost everything\nsays to me wistfully,\n"Someday, someday,\nbut certainly not now,\nI\'d like to learn how to have a conversation."'
p4486
aS'\nWhen I ask people\n"What\'s wrong with having a conversation?"\nPeople say, "I\'ll tell you what\'s wrong with having a conversation.\nIt takes place in real time\nand you can\'t control what you\'re going to say."\nSo that\'s the bottom line.\nTexting, email, posting,\nall of these things\nlet us present the self as we want to be.\nWe get to edit,\nand that means we get to delete,\nand that means we get to retouch,\nthe face, the voice,\nthe flesh, the body --\nnot too little, not too much,\njust right.'
p4487
aS"\nHuman relationships\nare rich and they're messy\nand they're demanding.\nAnd we clean them up with technology.\nAnd when we do,\none of the things that can happen\nis that we sacrifice conversation\nfor mere connection.\nWe short-change ourselves.\nAnd over time,\nwe seem to forget this,\nor we seem to stop caring."
p4488
aS'\nI was caught off guard\nwhen Stephen Colbert\nasked me a profound question,\na profound question.\nHe said, "Don\'t all those little tweets,\ndon\'t all those little sips\nof online communication,\nadd up to one big gulp\nof real conversation?"\nMy answer was no,\nthey don\'t add up.\nConnecting in sips may work\nfor gathering discreet bits of information,\nthey may work for saying, "I\'m thinking about you,"\nor even for saying, "I love you," --\nI mean, look at how I felt\nwhen I got that text from my daughter --\nbut they don\'t really work\nfor learning about each other,\nfor really coming to know and understand each other.\nAnd we use conversations with each other\nto learn how to have conversations\nwith ourselves.\nSo a flight from conversation\ncan really matter\nbecause it can compromise\nour capacity for self-reflection.\nFor kids growing up,\nthat skill is the bedrock of development.'
p4489
aS'\nOver and over I hear,\n"I would rather text than talk."\nAnd what I\'m seeing\nis that people get so used to being short-changed\nout of real conversation,\nso used to getting by with less,\nthat they\'ve become almost willing\nto dispense with people altogether.\nSo for example,\nmany people share with me this wish,\nthat some day a more advanced version of Siri,\nthe digital assistant on Apple\'s iPhone,\nwill be more like a best friend,\nsomeone who will listen\nwhen others won\'t.\nI believe this wish\nreflects a painful truth\nthat I\'ve learned in the past 15 years.\nThat feeling that no one is listening to me\nis very important\nin our relationships with technology.\nThat\'s why it\'s so appealing\nto have a Facebook page\nor a Twitter feed --\nso many automatic listeners.\nAnd the feeling that no one is listening to me\nmake us want to spend time\nwith machines that seem to care about us.'
p4490
aS"\nWe're developing robots,\nthey call them sociable robots,\nthat are specifically designed to be companions --\nto the elderly,\nto our children,\nto us.\nHave we so lost confidence\nthat we will be there for each other?\nDuring my research\nI worked in nursing homes,\nand I brought in these sociable robots\nthat were designed to give the elderly\nthe feeling that they were understood.\nAnd one day I came in\nand a woman who had lost a child\nwas talking to a robot\nin the shape of a baby seal.\nIt seemed to be looking in her eyes.\nIt seemed to be following the conversation.\nIt comforted her.\nAnd many people found this amazing."
p4491
aS'\nBut that woman was trying to make sense of her life\nwith a machine that had no experience\nof the arc of a human life.\nThat robot put on a great show.\nAnd we\'re vulnerable.\nPeople experience pretend empathy\nas though it were the real thing.\nSo during that moment\nwhen that woman\nwas experiencing that pretend empathy,\nI was thinking, "That robot can\'t empathize.\nIt doesn\'t face death.\nIt doesn\'t know life."'
p4492
aS'\nAnd as that woman took comfort\nin her robot companion,\nI didn\'t find it amazing;\nI found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments\nin my 15 years of work.\nBut when I stepped back,\nI felt myself\nat the cold, hard center\nof a perfect storm.\nWe expect more from technology\nand less from each other.\nAnd I ask myself,\n"Why have things come to this?"'
p4493
aS"\nAnd I believe it's because\ntechnology appeals to us most\nwhere we are most vulnerable.\nAnd we are vulnerable.\nWe're lonely,\nbut we're afraid of intimacy.\nAnd so from social networks to sociable robots,\nwe're designing technologies\nthat will give us the illusion of companionship\nwithout the demands of friendship.\nWe turn to technology to help us feel connected\nin ways we can comfortably control.\nBut we're not so comfortable.\nWe are not so much in control."
p4494
aS"\nThese days, those phones in our pockets\nare changing our minds and hearts\nbecause they offer us\nthree gratifying fantasies.\nOne, that we can put our attention\nwherever we want it to be;\ntwo, that we will always be heard;\nand three, that we will never have to be alone.\nAnd that third idea,\nthat we will never have to be alone,\nis central to changing our psyches.\nBecause the moment that people are alone,\neven for a few seconds,\nthey become anxious, they panic, they fidget,\nthey reach for a device.\nJust think of people at a checkout line\nor at a red light.\nBeing alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.\nAnd so people try to solve it by connecting.\nBut here, connection\nis more like a symptom than a cure.\nIt expresses, but it doesn't solve,\nan underlying problem.\nBut more than a symptom,\nconstant connection is changing\nthe way people think of themselves.\nIt's shaping a new way of being."
p4495
aS'\nThe best way to describe it is,\nI share therefore I am.\nWe use technology to define ourselves\nby sharing our thoughts and feelings\neven as we\'re having them.\nSo before it was:\nI have a feeling,\nI want to make a call.\nNow it\'s: I want to have a feeling,\nI need to send a text.\nThe problem with this new regime\nof "I share therefore I am"\nis that, if we don\'t have connection,\nwe don\'t feel like ourselves.\nWe almost don\'t feel ourselves.\nSo what do we do? We connect more and more.\nBut in the process,\nwe set ourselves up to be isolated.'
p4496
aS"\nHow do you get from connection to isolation?\nYou end up isolated\nif you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,\nthe ability to be separate,\nto gather yourself.\nSolitude is where you find yourself\nso that you can reach out to other people\nand form real attachments.\nWhen we don't have the capacity for solitude,\nwe turn to other people in order to feel less anxious\nor in order to feel alive.\nWhen this happens,\nwe're not able to appreciate who they are.\nIt's as though we're using them\nas spare parts\nto support our fragile sense of self.\nWe slip into thinking that always being connected\nis going to make us feel less alone.\nBut we're at risk,\nbecause actually it's the opposite that's true.\nIf we're not able to be alone,\nwe're going to be more lonely.\nAnd if we don't teach our children to be alone,\nthey're only going to know\nhow to be lonely."
p4497
aS'\nWhen I spoke at TED in 1996,\nreporting on my studies\nof the early virtual communities,\nI said, "Those who make the most\nof their lives on the screen\ncome to it in a spirit of self-reflection."\nAnd that\'s what I\'m calling for here, now:\nreflection and, more than that, a conversation\nabout where our current use of technology\nmay be taking us,\nwhat it might be costing us.\nWe\'re smitten with technology.\nAnd we\'re afraid, like young lovers,\nthat too much talking might spoil the romance.\nBut it\'s time to talk.\nWe grew up with digital technology\nand so we see it as all grown up.\nBut it\'s not, it\'s early days.\nThere\'s plenty of time\nfor us to reconsider how we use it,\nhow we build it.\nI\'m not suggesting\nthat we turn away from our devices,\njust that we develop a more self-aware relationship\nwith them, with each other\nand with ourselves.'
p4498
aS"\nI see some first steps.\nStart thinking of solitude\nas a good thing.\nMake room for it.\nFind ways to demonstrate this\nas a value to your children.\nCreate sacred spaces at home --\nthe kitchen, the dining room --\nand reclaim them for conversation.\nDo the same thing at work.\nAt work, we're so busy communicating\nthat we often don't have time to think,\nwe don't have time to talk,\nabout the things that really matter.\nChange that.\nMost important, we all really need to listen to each other,\nincluding to the boring bits.\nBecause it's when we stumble\nor hesitate or lose our words\nthat we reveal ourselves to each other."
p4499
aS"\nTechnology is making a bid\nto redefine human connection --\nhow we care for each other,\nhow we care for ourselves --\nbut it's also giving us the opportunity\nto affirm our values\nand our direction.\nI'm optimistic.\nWe have everything we need to start.\nWe have each other.\nAnd we have the greatest chance of success\nif we recognize our vulnerability.\nThat we listen\nwhen technology says\nit will take something complicated\nand promises something simpler."
p4500
aS'\nSo in my work,\nI hear that life is hard,\nrelationships are filled with risk.\nAnd then there\'s technology --\nsimpler, hopeful,\noptimistic, ever-young.\nIt\'s like calling in the cavalry.\nAn ad campaign promises\nthat online and with avatars,\nyou can "Finally, love your friends\nlove your body, love your life,\nonline and with avatars."\nWe\'re drawn to virtual romance,\nto computer games that seem like worlds,\nto the idea that robots, robots,\nwill someday be our true companions.\nWe spend an evening on the social network\ninstead of going to the pub with friends.'
p4501
aS"\nBut our fantasies of substitution\nhave cost us.\nNow we all need to focus\non the many, many ways\ntechnology can lead us back\nto our real lives, our own bodies,\nour own communities,\nour own politics,\nour own planet.\nThey need us.\nLet's talk about\nhow we can use digital technology,\nthe technology of our dreams,\nto make this life\nthe life we can love."

S"\nWe are losing our listening.\nWe spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening,\nbut we're not very good at it.\nWe retain just 25 percent of what we hear.\nNow not you, not this talk,\nbut that is generally true.\nLet's define listening\nas making meaning from sound.\nIt's a mental process,\nand it's a process of extraction."
p4522
aS'\nWe use some pretty cool techniques to do this.\nOne of them is pattern recognition.\n(Crowd Noise) So in a cocktail party like this,\nif I say, "David, Sara, pay attention,"\nsome of you just sat up.\nWe recognize patterns\nto distinguish noise from signal,\nand especially our name.\nDifferencing is another technique we use.\nIf I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes,\nyou would literally cease to hear it.\nWe listen to differences,\nwe discount sounds that remain the same.'
p4523
aS"\nAnd then there is a whole range of filters.\nThese filters take us from all sound\ndown to what we pay attention to.\nMost people are entirely unconscious\nof these filters.\nBut they actually create our reality in a way,\nbecause they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.\nGive you one example of that:\nIntention is very important in sound, in listening.\nWhen I married my wife,\nI promised her that I would listen to her every day\nas if for the first time.\nNow that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.\n(Laughter)\nBut it's a great intention to have in a relationship."
p4524
aS'\nBut that\'s not all.\nSound places us in space and in time.\nIf you close your eyes right now in this room,\nyou\'re aware of the size of the room\nfrom the reverberation\nand the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces.\nAnd you\'re aware of how many people are around you\nbecause of the micro-noises you\'re receiving.\nAnd sound places us in time as well,\nbecause sound always has\ntime embedded in it.\nIn fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way\nthat we experience the flow of time\nfrom past to future.\nSo, "Sonority is time and meaning" -- a great quote.'
p4525
aS"\nI said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.\nWhy did I say that?\nWell there are a lot of reasons for this.\nFirst of all, we invented ways of recording --\nfirst writing, then audio recording\nand now video recording as well.\nThe premium on accurate and careful listening\nhas simply disappeared.\nSecondly, the world is now so noisy,\n(Noise) with this cacophony going on\nvisually and auditorily,\nit's just hard to listen;\nit's tiring to listen.\nMany people take refuge in headphones,\nbut they turn big, public spaces like this,\nshared soundscapes,\ninto millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.\nIn this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody."
p4526
aS"\nWe're becoming impatient.\nWe don't want oratory anymore,\nwe want sound bites.\nAnd the art of conversation\nis being replaced -- dangerously, I think --\nby personal broadcasting.\nI don't know how much listening there is in this conversation,\nwhich is sadly very common,\nespecially in the U.K.\nWe're becoming desensitized.\nOur media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines\nin order to get our attention.\nAnd that means it's harder for us to pay attention\nto the quiet, the subtle,\nthe understated."
p4527
aS"\nThis is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.\nThis is not trivial.\nBecause listening is our access to understanding.\nConscious listening always creates understanding.\nAnd only without conscious listening\ncan these things happen --\na world where we don't listen to each other at all,\nis a very scary place indeed.\nSo I'd like to share with you\nfive simple exercises, tools you can take away with you,\nto improve your own conscious listening.\nWould you like that?"
p4528
aS'\n(Audience: Yes.) Good.'
p4529
aS"\nThe first one is silence.\nJust three minutes a day of silence\nis a wonderful exercise\nto reset your ears and to recalibrate\nso that you can hear the quiet again.\nIf you can't get absolute silence,\ngo for quiet, that's absolutely fine."
p4530
aS"\nSecond, I call this the mixer.\n(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this --\nand we all spend a lot of time in places like this --\nlisten in the coffee bar\nto how many channels of sound can I hear?\nHow many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?\nYou can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.\nHow many birds am I hearing?\nWhere are they? Where are those ripples?\nIt's a great exercise\nfor improving the quality of your listening."
p4531
aS"\nThird, this exercise I call savoring,\nand this is a beautiful exercise.\nIt's about enjoying mundane sounds.\nThis, for example, is my tumble dryer.\n(Dryer) It's a waltz.\nOne, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.\nI love it.\nOr just try this one on for size.\n(Coffee grinder)\nWow!\nSo mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention.\nI call that the hidden choir.\nIt's around us all the time."
p4532
aS"\nThe next exercise\nis probably the most important of all of these,\nif you just take one thing away.\nThis is listening positions --\nthe idea that you can move your listening position\nto what's appropriate to what you're listening to.\nThis is playing with those filters.\nDo you remember, I gave you those filters at the beginning.\nIt's starting to play with them as levers,\nto get conscious about them and to move to different places.\nThese are just some of the listening positions,\nor scales of listening positions, that you can use.\nThere are many.\nHave fun with that. It's very exciting."
p4533
aS'\nAnd finally, an acronym.\nYou can use this in listening, in communication.\nIf you\'re in any one of those roles --\nand I think that probably is everybody who\'s listening to this talk --\nthe acronym is RASA,\nwhich is the Sanskrit word\nfor juice or essence.\nAnd RASA stands for Receive,\nwhich means pay attention to the person;\nAppreciate, making little noises\nlike "hmm," "oh," "okay";\nSummarize, the word "so" is very important in communication;\nand Ask, ask questions afterward.'
p4534
aS"\nNow sound is my passion, it's my life.\nI wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen.\nThat's too much to ask from most people.\nBut I believe that every human being\nneeds to listen consciously\nin order to live fully --\nconnected in space and in time\nto the physical world around us,\nconnected in understanding to each other,\nnot to mention spiritually connected,\nbecause every spiritual path I know of\nhas listening and contemplation\nat its heart."
p4535
aS"\nThat's why\nwe need to teach listening in our schools\nas a skill.\nWhy is it not taught? It's crazy.\nAnd if we can teach listening in our schools,\nwe can take our listening off that slippery slope\nto that dangerous, scary world that I talked about\nand move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time --\nor at least capable of doing it."
p4536
aS"\nNow I don't know how to do that,\nbut this is TED,\nand I think the TED community is capable of anything.\nSo I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other,\ntake this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools,\nand transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world --\na world of connection,\na world of understanding and a world of peace."

aa(lp4540
S"\nWhat I thought I would do\nis I would start with a simple request.\nI'd like all of you\nto pause for a moment,\nyou wretched weaklings,\nand take stock of your miserable existence.\n(Laughter)"
p4541
aS"\nNow that was the advice\nthat St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers\nin the fifth century.\nIt was the advice that I decided to follow myself\nwhen I turned 40.\nUp until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --\nI was eating too much, I was drinking too much,\nI was working too hard\nand I was neglecting the family.\nAnd I decided that I would try\nand turn my life around.\nIn particular, I decided\nI would try to address the thorny issue\nof work-life balance.\nSo I stepped back from the workforce,\nand I spent a year at home\nwith my wife and four young children.\nBut all I learned about work-life balance\nfrom that year\nwas that I found it quite easy\nto balance work and life\nwhen I didn't have any work.\n(Laughter)\nNot a very useful skill,\nespecially when the money runs out."
p4542
aS"\nSo I went back to work,\nand I've spent these seven years since\nstruggling with, studying\nand writing about work-life balance.\nAnd I have four observations\nI'd like to share with you today.\nThe first is:\nif society's to make any progress on this issue,\nwe need an honest debate.\nBut the trouble is\nso many people talk so much rubbish\nabout work-life balance.\nAll the discussions about flexi-time\nor dress-down Fridays\nor paternity leave\nonly serve to mask the core issue,\nwhich is\nthat certain job and career choices\nare fundamentally incompatible\nwith being meaningfully engaged\non a day-to-day basis\nwith a young family.\nNow the first step in solving any problem\nis acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.\nAnd the reality of the society that we're in\nis there are thousands and thousands\nof people out there\nleading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,\nwhere they work long, hard hours\nat jobs they hate\nto enable them to buy things they don't need\nto impress people they don't like.\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nIt's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt\nisn't really getting to the nub of the issue."
p4543
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4544
aS'\nThe second observation I\'d like to make\nis we need to face the truth\nthat governments and corporations\naren\'t going to solve this issue for us.\nWe should stop looking outside.\nIt\'s up to us as individuals\nto take control and responsibility\nfor the type of lives that we want to lead.\nIf you don\'t design your life,\nsomeone else will design it for you,\nand you may just not like\ntheir idea of balance.\nIt\'s particularly important --\nthis isn\'t on the World Wide Web, is it? I\'m about to get fired --\nit\'s particularly important\nthat you never put the quality of your life\nin the hands of a commercial corporation.\nNow I\'m not talking here just about the bad companies --\nthe "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.\n(Laughter)\nI\'m talking about all companies.\nBecause commercial companies\nare inherently designed\nto get as much out of you [as]\nthey can get away with.\nIt\'s in their nature; it\'s in their DNA;\nit\'s what they do --\neven the good, well-intentioned companies.\nOn the one hand,\nputting childcare facilities in the workplace\nis wonderful and enlightened.\nOn the other hand, it\'s a nightmare --\nit just means you spend more time at the bloody office.\nWe have to be responsible\nfor setting and enforcing\nthe boundaries that we want in our life.'
p4545
aS'\nThe third observation is\nwe have to be careful\nwith the time frame that we choose\nupon which to judge our balance.\nBefore I went back to work\nafter my year at home,\nI sat down\nand I wrote out\na detailed, step-by-step description\nof the ideal balanced day\nthat I aspired to.\nAnd it went like this:\nwake up well rested\nafter a good night\'s sleep.\nHave sex.\nWalk the dog.\nHave breakfast with my wife and children.\nHave sex again.\n(Laughter)\nDrive the kids to school on the way to the office.\nDo three hours\' work.\nPlay a sport with a friend at lunchtime.\nDo another three hours\' work.\nMeet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.\nDrive home for dinner\nwith my wife and kids.\nMeditate for half an hour.\nHave sex.\nWalk the dog. Have sex again.\nGo to bed.\n(Applause)\nHow often do you think I have that day?\n(Laughter)\nWe need to be realistic.\nYou can\'t do it all in one day.\nWe need to elongate the time frame\nupon which we judge the balance in our life,\nbut we need to elongate it\nwithout falling into the trap\nof the "I\'ll have a life when I retire,\nwhen my kids have left home,\nwhen my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,\nI\'ve got no mates or interests left."\n(Laughter)\nA day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.\nThere\'s got to be a middle way.'
p4546
aS'\nA fourth observation:\nWe need to approach balance\nin a balanced way.\nA friend came to see me last year --\nand she doesn\'t mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year\nand said, "Nigel, I\'ve read your book.\nAnd I realize that my life is completely out of balance.\nIt\'s totally dominated by work.\nI work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.\nAll of my relationships have failed.\nThere\'s nothing in my life\napart from my work.\nSo I\'ve decided to get a grip and sort it out.\nSo I joined a gym."\n(Laughter)\nNow I don\'t mean to mock,\nbut being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat\nisn\'t more balanced; it\'s more fit.\n(Laughter)\nLovely though physical exercise may be,\nthere are other parts to life --\nthere\'s the intellectual side; there\'s the emotional side;\nthere\'s the spiritual side.\nAnd to be balanced,\nI believe we have to attend\nto all of those areas --\nnot just do 50 stomach crunches.'
p4547
aS'\nNow that can be daunting.\nBecause people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven\'t got time to get fit.\nYou want me to go to church and call my mother."\nAnd I understand.\nI truly understand how that can be daunting.\nBut an incident that happened a couple of years ago\ngave me a new perspective.\nMy wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,\ncalled me up at the office\nand said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --\nHarry -- "up from school."\nBecause she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.\nSo I left work an hour early that afternoon\nand picked Harry up at the school gates.\nWe walked down to the local park,\nmessed around on the swings, played some silly games.\nI then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,\nand we shared a pizza for two,\nthen walked down the hill to our home,\nand I gave him his bath\nand put him in his Batman pajamas.\nI then read him a chapter\nof Roald Dahl\'s "James and the Giant Peach."\nI then put him to bed, tucked him in,\ngave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"\nand walked out of his bedroom.\nAs I was walking out of his bedroom,\nhe said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"\nHe went, "Dad, this has been the best day\nof my life, ever."\nI hadn\'t done anything,\nhadn\'t taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.'
p4548
aS"\nNow my point is\nthe small things matter.\nBeing more balanced\ndoesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.\nWith the smallest investment\nin the right places,\nyou can radically transform the quality of your relationships\nand the quality of your life.\nMoreover, I think,\nit can transform society.\nBecause if enough people do it,\nwe can change society's definition of success\naway from the moronically simplistic notion\nthat the person with the most money when he dies wins,\nto a more thoughtful and balanced definition\nof what a life well lived looks like.\nAnd that, I think,\nis an idea worth spreading."
p4549
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4550
aa(lp4551
S'\nI\'m going to speak today about the relationship\nbetween science and human values.\nNow, it\'s generally understood that\nquestions of morality --\nquestions of good and evil and right and wrong --\nare questions about which science officially has no opinion.\nIt\'s thought that science can help us\nget what we value,\nbut it can never tell us what we ought to value.\nAnd, consequently, most people -- I think most people\nprobably here -- think that science will never answer\nthe most important questions in human life:\nquestions like, "What is worth living for?"\n"What is worth dying for?"\n"What constitutes a good life?"'
p4552
aS"\nSo, I'm going to argue\nthat this is an illusion -- that the separation between\nscience and human values is an illusion --\nand actually quite a dangerous one\nat this point in human history.\nNow, it's often said that science\ncannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,\nbecause science deals with facts,\nand facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.\nIt's often thought that there's no description\nof the way the world is\nthat can tell us how the world ought to be.\nBut I think this is quite clearly untrue.\nValues are a certain kind of fact.\nThey are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures."
p4553
aS"\nWhy is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?\nWhy don't we feel compassion for rocks?\nIt's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more\nconcerned about our fellow primates\nthan we are about insects, as indeed we are,\nit's because we think they're exposed to a greater range\nof potential happiness and suffering.\nNow, the crucial thing to notice here\nis that this is a factual claim:\nThis is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we\nhave misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity\nand the possibilities of experience\nwell then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects."
p4554
aS"\nAnd there's no notion,\nno version of human morality\nand human values that I've ever come across\nthat is not at some point reducible\nto a concern about conscious experience\nand its possible changes.\nEven if you get your values from religion,\neven if you think that good and evil ultimately\nrelate to conditions after death --\neither to an eternity of happiness with God\nor an eternity of suffering in hell --\nyou are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.\nAnd to say that such changes can persist after death\nis itself a factual claim,\nwhich, of course, may or may not be true."
p4555
aS"\nNow, to speak about the conditions of well-being\nin this life, for human beings,\nwe know that there is a continuum of such facts.\nWe know that it's possible to live in a failed state,\nwhere everything that can go wrong does go wrong --\nwhere mothers cannot feed their children,\nwhere strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,\nwhere people are murdered indiscriminately.\nAnd we know that it's possible to move along this continuum\ntowards something quite a bit more idyllic,\nto a place where a conference like this is even conceivable."
p4556
aS'\nAnd we know -- we know --\nthat there are right and wrong answers\nto how to move in this space.\nWould adding cholera to the water be a good idea?\nProbably not.\nWould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,\nso that when bad things happened to them\nthey immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.\nThere are truths to be known\nabout how human communities flourish,\nwhether or not we understand these truths.\nAnd morality relates to these truths.'
p4557
aS"\nSo, in talking about values we are talking about facts.\nNow, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --\nfrom the level of the genome\non up to the level of economic systems\nand political arrangements.\nBut if we're going to talk about human well-being\nwe are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.\nBecause we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it\nis realized in the brain --"
p4558
aS'\nwhatever happens after death.\nEven if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,\nin this life, his personality --\nhis rather unfortunate personality --\nis the product of his brain.\nSo the contributions of culture --\nif culture changes us, as indeed it does,\nit changes us by changing our brains.\nAnd so therefore whatever cultural variation there is\nin how human beings flourish\ncan, at least in principle, be understood\nin the context of a maturing science of the mind --\nneuroscience, psychology, etc.'
p4559
aS"\nSo, what I'm arguing is that\nvalue's reduced to facts --\nto facts about the conscious experience\nof conscious beings.\nAnd we can therefore visualize a space\nof possible changes in the experience of these beings.\nAnd I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,\nwith peaks and valleys that correspond\nto differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,\nboth personal and collective.\nAnd one thing to notice is that perhaps\nthere are states of human well-being\nthat we rarely access, that few people access.\nAnd these await our discovery.\nPerhaps some of these states can be appropriately called\nmystical or spiritual.\nPerhaps there are other states that we can't access\nbecause of how our minds are structured\nbut other minds possibly could access them."
p4560
aS"\nNow, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying\nthat science is guaranteed to map this space,\nor that we will have scientific answers to every\nconceivable moral question.\nI don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult\na supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,\nor whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,\nor whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.\n(Laughter)\nBut if questions affect human well-being\nthen they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.\nAnd just admitting this --\njust admitting that there are right and wrong answers\nto the question of how humans flourish --\nwill change the way we talk about morality,\nand will change our expectations\nof human cooperation in the future."
p4561
aS"\nFor instance, there are 21 states in our country\nwhere corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,\nwhere it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,\nand raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.\nAnd hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,\nare subjected to this every year.\nThe locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.\nWe're not talking about Connecticut."
p4562
aS'\nAnd the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.\nThe creator of the universe himself\nhas told us not to spare the rod,\nlest we spoil the child --\nthis is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.\nBut we can ask the obvious question:\nIs it a good idea, generally speaking,\nto subject children to pain\nand violence and public humiliation\nas a way of encouraging healthy emotional development\nand good behavior?\n(Laughter)\nIs there any doubt\nthat this question has an answer,\nand that it matters?'
p4563
aS"\nNow, many of you might worry\nthat the notion of well-being is truly undefined,\nand seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.\nAnd so, how therefore can there be an\nobjective notion of well-being?\nWell, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.\nThe concept of physical health is undefined.\nAs we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.\nWhen this statue was carved\nthe average life expectancy was probably 30.\nIt's now around 80 in the developed world.\nThere may come a time when we meddle with our genomes\nin such a way that not being able to run a marathon\nat age 200 will be considered a profound disability.\nPeople will send you donations when you're in that condition.\n(Laughter)"
p4564
aS'\nNotice that the fact that the concept of health\nis open, genuinely open for revision,\ndoes not make it vacuous.\nThe distinction between a healthy person\nand a dead one\nis about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.\nAnother thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:\nThere may be equivalent ways to thrive;\nthere may be equivalent ways to organize a human society\nso as to maximize human flourishing.'
p4565
aS'\nNow, why wouldn\'t this\nundermine an objective morality?\nWell think of how we talk about food:\nI would never be tempted to argue to you\nthat there must be one right food to eat.\nThere is clearly a range of materials\nthat constitute healthy food.\nBut there\'s nevertheless a clear distinction\nbetween food and poison.\nThe fact that there are many right answers\nto the question, "What is food?"\ndoes not tempt us\nto say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.\nMany people worry\nthat a universal morality would require\nmoral precepts that admit of no exceptions.'
p4566
aS'\nSo, for instance, if it\'s really wrong to lie,\nit must always be wrong to lie,\nand if you can find an exception,\nwell then there\'s no such thing as moral truth.\nWhy would we think this?\nConsider, by analogy, the game of chess.\nNow, if you\'re going to play good chess,\na principle like, "Don\'t lose your Queen,"\nis very good to follow.\nBut it clearly admits some exceptions.\nThere are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.\nThere are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.\nAnd yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.\nThe fact that there are exceptions here does not\nchange that at all.'
p4567
aS'\nNow, this brings us to the sorts of moves\nthat people are apt to make in the moral sphere.\nConsider the great problem of women\'s bodies:\nWhat to do about them?\nWell this is one thing you can do about them:\nYou can cover them up.\nNow, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community\nthat while we may not like this,\nwe might think of this as "wrong"\nin Boston or Palo Alto,\nwho are we to say\nthat the proud denizens of an ancient culture\nare wrong to force their wives and daughters\nto live in cloth bags?\nAnd who are we to say, even, that they\'re wrong\nto beat them with lengths of steel cable,\nor throw battery acid in their faces\nif they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?'
p4568
aS"\nWell, who are we not to say this?\nWho are we to pretend\nthat we know so little about human well-being\nthat we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?\nI'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --\nwomen should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.\nBut what does voluntary mean\nin a community where,\nwhen a girl gets raped,\nher father's first impulse,\nrather often, is to murder her out of shame?"
p4569
aS'\nJust let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:\nYour daughter gets raped,\nand what you want to do is kill her.\nWhat are the chances that represents\na peak of human flourishing?'
p4570
aS'\nNow, to say this is not to say that we have got the\nperfect solution in our own society.\nFor instance,\nthis is what it\'s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere\nin the civilized world.\nNow, granted, for many men\nit may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.\n(Laughter)\nBut if we are in a reflective mood,\nwe can ask,\n"Is this the perfect expression\nof psychological balance\nwith respect to variables like youth and beauty and women\'s bodies?"\nI mean, is this the optimal environment\nin which to raise our children?\nProbably not. OK, so perhaps there\'s some place\non the spectrum\nbetween these two extremes\nthat represents a place of better balance.\n(Applause)\nPerhaps there are many such places --'
p4571
aS'\nagain, given other changes in human culture\nthere may be many peaks on the moral landscape.\nBut the thing to notice is that there will be\nmany more ways not to be on a peak.\nNow the irony, from my perspective,\nis that the only people who seem to generally agree with me\nand who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions\nare religious demagogues of one form or another.'
p4572
aS'\nAnd of course they think they have right answers to moral questions\nbecause they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,\nnot because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes\nand condition of human and animal well-being.\nIn fact, the endurance of religion\nas a lens through which most people view moral questions\nhas separated most moral talk\nfrom real questions of human and animal suffering.\nThis is why we spend our time\ntalking about things like gay marriage\nand not about genocide or nuclear proliferation\nor poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.\nBut the demagogues are right about one thing: We need\na universal conception of human values.'
p4573
aS"\nNow, what stands in the way of this?\nWell, one thing to notice is that we\ndo something different when talking about morality --\nespecially secular, academic, scientist types.\nWhen talking about morality we value differences of opinion\nin a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.\nSo, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning\nmeditating on compassion,\nand he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component\nof human happiness.\nOn the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;\nTed Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping\nand torturing and killing young women."
p4574
aS'\nSo, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion\nabout how to profitably use one\'s time.\n(Laughter)\nMost Western intellectuals\nlook at this situation\nand say, "Well, there\'s nothing for the Dalai Lama\nto be really right about -- really right about --\nor for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about\nthat admits of a real argument\nthat potentially falls within the purview of science.\nHe likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.\nThere\'s nothing that one should be able to say to the other\nthat should persuade the other."\nNotice that we don\'t do this in science.'
p4575
aS'\nOn the left you have Edward Witten.\nHe\'s a string theorist.\nIf you ask the smartest physicists around\nwho is the smartest physicist around,\nin my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.\nThe other half will tell you they don\'t like the question.\n(Laughter)\nSo, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference\nand said,"String theory is bogus.\nIt doesn\'t resonate with me. It\'s not how I chose to\nview the universe at a small scale.\nI\'m not a fan."\n(Laughter)\nWell, nothing would happen because I\'m not a physicist;\nI don\'t understand string theory.\nI\'m the Ted Bundy of string theory.\n(Laughter)\nI wouldn\'t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.'
p4576
aS'\nBut this is just the point.\nWhenever we are talking about facts\ncertain opinions must be excluded.\nThat is what it is to have a domain of expertise.\nThat is what it is for knowledge to count.\nHow have we convinced ourselves\nthat in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,\nor moral talent, or moral genius even?\nHow have we convinced ourselves\nthat every opinion has to count?\nHow have we convinced ourselves\nthat every culture has a point of view\non these subjects worth considering?\nDoes the Taliban\nhave a point of view on physics\nthat is worth considering? No.\n(Laughter)\nHow is their ignorance any less obvious\non the subject of human well-being?\n(Applause)'
p4577
aS"\nSo, this, I think, is what the world needs now.\nIt needs people like ourselves to admit\nthat there are right and wrong answers\nto questions of human flourishing,\nand morality relates\nto that domain of facts.\nIt is possible\nfor individuals, and even for whole cultures,\nto care about the wrong things,\nwhich is to say that it's possible for them\nto have beliefs and desires that reliably lead\nto needless human suffering.\nJust admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.\nWe live in a world in which\nthe boundaries between nations mean less and less,\nand they will one day mean nothing."
p4578
aS'\nWe live in a world filled with destructive technology,\nand this technology cannot be uninvented;\nit will always be easier\nto break things than to fix them.\nIt seems to me, therefore, patently obvious\nthat we can no more\nrespect and tolerate\nvast differences in notions of human well-being\nthan we can respect or tolerate vast differences\nin the notions about how disease spreads,\nor in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.\nWe simply must converge\non the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.\nAnd to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause)'

aS'\nLanguage seems to be really important here.\nWhen you\'re talking about the veil,\nyou\'re talking about women dressed in cloth bags.\nI\'ve lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.\nAnd some of them would say something else. They would say,\n"No, you know, this is a celebration\nof female specialness,\nit helps build that and it\'s a result of the fact that" --\nand this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --\n"that male lust is not to be trusted."\nI mean, can you engage in a conversation\nwith that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?'
p4581
aS"\nSam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,\nwatching the clock ticking,\nbut the question is:\nWhat is voluntary in a context\nwhere men have certain expectations,\nand you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way\nif you don't veil yourself?\nAnd so, if anyone in this room\nwanted to wear a veil,\nor a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --\nI think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,\nbut we have to be honest about\nthe constraints that these women are placed under.\nAnd so I think we shouldn't be so eager\nto always take their word for it,\nespecially when it's 120 degrees out\nand you're wearing a full burqa."
p4582
aS"\nCA: A lot of people want to believe in this\nconcept of moral progress.\nBut can you reconcile that?\nI think I understood you to say that you could\nreconcile that with a world that doesn't become\none dimensional, where we all have to think the same.\nPaint your picture of what\nrolling the clock 50 years forward,\n100 years forward, how you would like to think of\nthe world, balancing moral progress\nwith richness."
p4583
aS"\nSH: Well, I think once you admit\nthat we are on the path toward understanding our minds\nat the level of the brain in some important detail,\nthen you have to admit\nthat we are going to understand all of the positive\nand negative qualities\nof ourselves in much greater detail.\nSo, we're going to understand positive social emotion\nlike empathy and compassion,\nand we're going to understand the factors\nthat encourage it -- whether they're genetic,\nwhether they're how people talk to one another,\nwhether they're economic systems,\nand insofar as we begin to shine light on that\nwe are inevitably going to converge\non that fact space."
p4584
aS"\nSo, everything is not going to be up for grabs.\nIt's not going to be like\nveiling my daughter from birth\nis just as good as teaching her\nto be confident and well-educated\nin the context of men who do desire women.\nI mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know\nthat compulsory veiling is a bad idea --\nbut at a certain point\nwe're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved\nand actually interrogate them.\nDo people love their daughters\njust as much in these systems?\nAnd I think there are clearly right answers to that."

S'\nSo my name is Taylor Wilson.\nI am 17 years old\nand I am a nuclear physicist,\nwhich may be a little hard to believe, but I am.\nAnd I would like to make the case\nthat nuclear fusion\nwill be that point,\nthat the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about\nwill get us to.\nSo nuclear fusion is our energy future.\nAnd the second point,\nmaking the case that kids can really change the world.'
p4591
aS'\nSo you may ask --\n(Applause)\nYou may ask me,\nwell how do you know what our energy future is?\nWell I built a fusion reactor\nwhen I was 14 years old.\nThat is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.\nI started building this project\nwhen I was about 12 or 13 years old.\nI decided I wanted to make a star.'
p4592
aS"\nNow most of you are probably saying,\nwell there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.\nI don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.\nWell it doesn't break even.\nIt doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,\nbut it still does some pretty cool stuff.\nAnd I assembled this in my garage,\nand it now lives in the physics department\nof the University of Nevada, Reno.\nAnd it slams together deuterium,\nwhich is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.\nSo this is similar to the reaction\nof the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.\nAnd I'm slamming it together so hard\nthat that hydrogen fuses together,\nand in the process it has some byproducts,\nand I utilize those byproducts."
p4593
aS"\nSo this previous year,\nI won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.\nI developed a detector that replaces the current detectors\nthat Homeland Security has.\nFor hundreds of dollars,\nI've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity\nof detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nI built this in my garage."
p4594
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4595
aS"\nAnd I've developed a system\nto produce medical isotopes.\nInstead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities\nI've developed a device that, on a very small scale,\ncan produce these isotopes."
p4596
aS"\nSo that's my fusion reactor in the background there.\nThat is me at the control panel\nof my fusion reactor.\nOh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,\nso my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.\nSo maybe I don't want to admit to that.\nThis is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,\nwhich is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.\nAnd this is me with President Obama,\nshowing him my Homeland Security research."

S'\nWe all make decisions every day; we want to know\nwhat the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial\nto the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.\nAnd surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do\nexactly the right thing at all possible times,\nthat would be a tremendous gift.'
p4602
aS"\nIt turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738\nby a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.\nAnd what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,\nand I also want to explain to you why it is\nthat it hasn't made a damn bit of difference."
p4603
aS"\nNow, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.\nAnd if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.\nBut the simple English translation -- much less precise,\nbut it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:\nThe expected value of any of our actions --\nthat is, the goodness that we can count on getting --\nis the product of two simple things:\nthe odds that this action will allow us to gain something,\nand the value of that gain to us."
p4604
aS'\nIn a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,\nif we can estimate and multiply these two things,\nwe will always know precisely how we should behave.'
p4605
aS"\nNow, this simple equation, even for those of you\nwho don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.\nHere's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play\na little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,\nand if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,\nbut you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,\nmost of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know\nthat the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,\nthat multiplies to five, and that's more\nthan I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.\nThis is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet."
p4606
aS"\nNow, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,\nbut in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.\nPeople are horrible at estimating both of these things,\nand that's what I want to talk to you about today."
p4607
aS"\nThere are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide\nwhat the right thing is to do, and those are\nerrors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,\nand errors in estimating the value of their own success.\nNow, let me talk about the first one first.\nCalculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:\nthere are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.\nYou all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades\nor of flipping a heads.\nBut as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply\nin everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --\nI should say, lose more -- gambling\nthan on all other forms of entertainment combined.\nThe reason is, this isn't how people do odds."
p4608
aS"\nThe way people figure odds\nrequires that we first talk a bit about pigs.\nNow, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think\nthere are more dogs or pigs on leashes\nobserved in any particular day in Oxford.\nAnd of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.\nAnd the way that you know that the answer is dogs is\nyou quickly reviewed in memory the times\nyou've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.\nIt was very easy to remember seeing dogs,\nnot so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed\nthat if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,\nthen dogs on leashes are more probable.\nThat's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is."
p4609
aS"\nSo, for example, here's a word puzzle.\nAre there more four-letter English words\nwith R in the third place or R in the first place?\nWell, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,\nand it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,\nand very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.\nBut in fact, there are many more words in the English language\nwith R in the third than the first place.\nThe reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind\nisn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.\nIt's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.\nYou kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.\nIt's like the dictionary;\nit's hard to look things up by the third letter.\nSo, this is an example of how this idea that\nthe quickness with which things come to mind\ncan give you a sense of their probability --"
p4610
aS"\nhow this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.\nFor example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds\nthat they will die in a variety of interesting ways --\nthese are estimates of number of deaths per year\nper 200 million U.S. citizens.\nAnd these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked\nto guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.\nCompare these to the actual numbers."
p4611
aS'\nNow, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,\ntwo things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.\nTwo things are vastly underestimated:\ndying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?\nWhen was the last time that you picked up a newspaper\nand the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"\nIt\'s not interesting because it\'s so common.\nIt\'s very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances\nof news stories or newsreels where we\'ve seen\ntornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck\nwho\'s blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.\nDrownings and asthma deaths don\'t get much coverage.\nThey don\'t come quickly to mind, and as a result,\nwe vastly underestimate them.'
p4612
aS'\nIndeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game\nof "Which thing doesn\'t belong?" And you\'re right to say\nit\'s the swimming pool that doesn\'t belong, because the swimming pool\nis the only thing on this slide that\'s actually very dangerous.\nThe way that more of you are likely to die than the combination\nof all three of the others that you see on the slide.'
p4613
aS"\nThe lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case\nof people's ability to compute probabilities.\nAnd economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --\nbut economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery\nas a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff\nby investing your money in a lottery ticket\nare approximately equivalent to flushing the money\ndirectly down the toilet -- which, by the way,\ndoesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything."
p4614
aS'\nWhy in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?\nWell, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,\nwe see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,\nor Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --\nhow the hell do you cash things that size, I don\'t know.\nWe see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.\nWhen was the last time that you saw extensive interviews\nwith everybody who lost?\nIndeed, if we required that television stations run\na 30-second interview with each loser\nevery time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers\nin the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years\nof your undivided attention just to watch them say,\n"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."\nNow, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --\nno sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,\nand then at the end there\'s 30 seconds of, "and I won,"\nthe likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.'
p4615
aS'\nLook, I can prove this to you: here\'s a little lottery.\nThere\'s 10 tickets in this lottery.\nNine of them have been sold to these individuals.\nIt costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,\nyou get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?\nWell, Bernoulli tells us it is.\nThe expected value of this lottery is two dollars;\nthis is a lottery in which you should invest your money.\nAnd most people say, "OK, I\'ll play."'
p4616
aS'\nNow, a slightly different version of this lottery:\nimagine that the nine tickets are all owned\nby one fat guy named Leroy.\nLeroy has nine tickets; there\'s one left.\nDo you want it? Most people won\'t play this lottery.\nNow, you can see the odds of winning haven\'t changed,\nbut it\'s now fantastically easy to imagine who\'s going to win.\nIt\'s easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?\nYou can\'t say to yourself, "I\'m as likely to win as anybody,"\nbecause you\'re not as likely to win as Leroy.\nThe fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy\nchanges your decision to play,\neven though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.'
p4617
aS"\nNow, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake\ncompared to trying to estimate value:\ntrying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,\nhow much pleasure it will give us.\nI want to talk now about errors in value.\nHow much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?\nMost of you have the intuition that it's not --\nyou wouldn't pay that for it."
p4618
aS"\nBut in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires\nthat you ask one, and only one question, which is:\nWhat else can I do with 25 dollars?\nIf you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia\nand realized that they're not going to serve you any food,\nbut somebody in the row in front of you has just opened\nthe McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches\nis wafting over the seat, you think,\nI can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.\nI can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!\nSuddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal."
p4619
aS'\nOn the other hand, if you\'re visiting an underdeveloped country,\nand 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it\'s exorbitant for a Big Mac.\nWhy were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,\nbefore I\'d even told you anything about the context?\nBecause most of you compared the price of this Big Mac\nto the price you\'re used to paying. Rather than asking,\n"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment\nto other possible investments, you compared to the past.\nAnd this is a systematic error people make.\nWhat you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.'
p4620
aS"\nThis is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing\nthe kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.\nFor example, this is, of course,\none of the most delicious tricks in marketing,\nis to say something used to be higher,\nand suddenly it seems like a very good deal.\nWhen people are asked about these two different jobs:\na job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,\na job where you're getting a salary cut each year,\nand one in which you're getting a salary increase,\npeople like the second job better than the first, despite the fact\nthey're all told they make much less money. Why?\nBecause they had the sense that declining wages are worse\nthan rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher\nin the declining period. Here's another nice example."
p4621
aS"\nHere's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.\nAssuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?\nMost people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:\n$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,\nso you decide to mull it over for a week.\nBy the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --\nthe package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.\nWhy? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500\nfor something that was 700 last week."
p4622
aS'\nThis tendency to compare to the past\nis causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,\na good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good\nas an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.'
p4623
aS"\nHere's another example of how comparing to the past\ncan befuddle our decisions.\nImagine that you're going to the theater.\nYou're on your way to the theater.\nIn your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.\nYou also have a 20-dollar bill.\nWhen you arrive at the theater,\nyou discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.\nWould you spend your remaining money on replacing it?\nMost people answer, no.\nNow, let's just change one thing in this scenario.\nYou're on your way to the theater,\nand in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.\nWhen you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.\nWould you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?\nWell, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.\nWhat does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?"
p4624
aS"\nNow, just in case you're not getting it,\nhere's a schematic of what happened, OK?\n(Laughter)\nAlong the way, you lost something.\nIn both cases, it was a piece of paper.\nIn one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.\nWhat the hell difference should it make?\nThe difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,\nI'm not paying twice for the same thing.\nYou compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --\nto the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.\nComparing with the past causes many of the problems\nthat behavioral economists and psychologists identify\nin people's attempts to assign value.\nBut even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,\nwe still make certain kinds of mistakes.\nAnd I'm going to show you one or two of them."
p4625
aS"\nOne of the things we know about comparison:\nthat when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.\nSo in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were\nkind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,\ndidn't seem like such a great guy.\nSuddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.\n(Laughter)\nThe comparison changes how we evaluate him."
p4626
aS"\nNow, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,\nand they use this wisdom to help you --\nspare you the undue burden of money.\nAnd so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop\nand you had to buy a bottle of wine,\nand you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?\nMost people don't want the most expensive,\nthey don't want the least expensive.\nSo, they will opt for the item in the middle.\nIf you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item\nthat nobody will ever buy on the shelf,\nbecause suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison."
p4627
aS"\nSo I'm telling you something you already knew:\nnamely, that comparison changes the value of things.\nHere's why that's a problem:\nthe problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,\nit won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.\nThe comparisons we make when we are appraising value,\nwhere we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,\nare not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.\nThis problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil\nour attempts to make rational decisions."
p4628
aS"\nLet me just give you an example.\nI have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.\nThese are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked\nthe simplest of all questions:\nHow much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?\nThey're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.\nFor some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room\nis a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.\nIn fact, these items that are sitting in the room change\nhow much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.\nNamely, those who are looking at Spam\nthink potato chips are going to be quite tasty;\nthose who are looking at Godiva chocolate\nthink they won't be nearly so tasty.\nOf course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?\nWell, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that\nwhen you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,\nwhat's sitting in the corner of the room\nmakes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.\nNonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison\nthat then does not carry through and change their experience."
p4629
aS"\nYou've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come\ninto our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:\nYou want to buy a car stereo.\nThe dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,\nbut if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.\nSo would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?\nMost people say they would.\nThey can't imagine buying it for twice the price\nwhen, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off."
p4630
aS"\nNow, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,\nand the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.\nBut if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.\nWould you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.\nMost people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town\nto save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?"
p4631
aS"\nThis kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.\nBecause this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --\ndoesn't know where it came from.\nIt doesn't know what you saved it on.\nWhen you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,\nI'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,\nI'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.\nAnd if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks\nno matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.\nThat's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager\nis taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,\nbut they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste."
p4632
aS"\nNow, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,\nbecause what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks\nto the purchase that you're making,\nbut when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.\nYou've all had this experience."
p4633
aS'\nIf you\'re an American, for example, you\'ve probably traveled in France.\nAnd at some point you may have met a couple\nfrom your own hometown, and you thought,\n"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They\'re so nice to me.\nI mean, compared to all these people who hate me\nwhen I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don\'t,\nthese people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,\nand then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,\nand what do you find?\nCompared to your regular friends,\nthey are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,\nthe comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself\ndisliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.'
p4634
aS'\nNow, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.\nYou go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --\nthese big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,\nand you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:\nthe big ones sound a little better.\nAnd so you buy them, and you bring them home,\nand you entirely violate the dcor of your house.\nAnd the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store\nis a comparison you\'ll never make again.\nWhat are the odds that years later you\'ll turn on the stereo and go,\n"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"\nwhich you can\'t even remember hearing.'
p4635
aS'\nThe problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult\nwhen these choices are arrayed over time.\nPeople have a lot of trouble making decisions\nabout things that will happen at different points in time.\nAnd what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered\nis that by and large people use two simple rules.\nSo let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem\nand then a third, hard, problem.'
p4636
aS"\nHere's the first easy problem:\nYou can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?\nThis is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?\nAll of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,\nwe believe more is better than less."

aS"\nHere's the second problem:\nYou can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?\nAgain, an easy decision,\nbecause we all know that now is better than later.\nWhat's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.\nFor example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.\nThis typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain\nby waiting, but you have to be patient.\nWhat do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?\nWell, by and large people are enormously impatient.\nThat is, they require interest rates in the hundred\nor thousands of percents in order to delay gratification\nand wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.\nMaybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is\nhow easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing\nwhen the delivery of these monetary units will happen.\nImagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --\nor 60 dollars in 13 months.\nWhat do we find now?\nPeople are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,\nthey might as well wait 13."
p4638
aS'\nWhat makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?\nComparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.'
p4639
aS"\nThis is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested\nyou would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,\npeople find that the subjective value of 50 is higher\nthan the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now\nor one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --\nbut they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision\noff into the future a year.\nNow, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?"
p4640
aS"\nThese guys can tell us.\nWhat you see here are two lads,\none of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.\nThey are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,\nand I want you to notice two things.\nAt no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.\nHowever, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.\nFirst it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,\nthen a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth."
p4641
aS'\nHere are the results of what I just showed you.\nThis is the subjective height --\nthe height you saw of these guys at various points.\nAnd I want you to see that two things are true.\nOne, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;\nand two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.\nBut watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.\nAt a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,\nbut at a far distance\ntheir normal, their true, relations are preserved.\nAs Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.\nThese are the results of the hard problem I gave you:\n60 now or 50 in a month?\nAnd these are subjective values,\nand what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.'
p4642
aS"\nPeople always think more is better than less:\n60 is always better than 50,\nand they always think now is better than later:\nthe bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.\nWatch what happens when we drop some out.\nSuddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.\nWe have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now\nover waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.\nNotice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that\nwhen people get to the future, they will change their minds.\nThat is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,\nwhat was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?\nI'll take the 50 dollars now."
p4643
aS"\nWell, the question with which I'd like to end is this:\nIf we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?\nBecause I could go on for about two hours with evidence\nof people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value."
p4644
aS"\nThe answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard\nin some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:\nnamely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world\nthan the one in which we are living.\nThey were evolved for a world\nin which people lived in very small groups,\nrarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,\nhad rather short lives in which there were few choices\nand the highest priority was to eat and mate today."
p4645
aS"\nBernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us\nhow we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.\nThat explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains\nwhy it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.\nWe are the only species on this planet\nthat has ever held its own fate in its hands.\nWe have no significant predators,\nwe're the masters of our physical environment;\nthe things that normally cause species to become extinct\nare no longer any threat to us.\nThe only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us\nare our own decisions.\nIf we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because\nwe could not take advantage of the gift given to us\nby a young Dutch fellow in 1738,\nbecause we underestimated the odds of our future pains\nand overestimated the value of our present pleasures."

p4648
aS'\nBill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism\nis in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,\nand is there some way that we could counteract that?'
p4649
aS"\nDan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently\nwith the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes\nthat American security dollars should go to making borders safer.\nI tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name\nbased on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,\nand that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask\nwhat causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,\nrather than -- not rather than, but in addition to\nstopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.\nSurely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --\nand forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.\nWe already know, for example, in the United States,\nmore people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --\nbecause they were scared -- and driving on highways,\nthan were killed in 9/11. OK?\nIf I told you that there was a plague\nthat was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,\nyou might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.\nThese are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering\nwhether they should get the kind of play,\nthe kind of coverage, that they do.\nSurely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood\nthat they'll be hurt in these various ways,\nand gives power to the very people who want to frighten us."
p4650
aS"\nCA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying\nthat our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?\nTalk more about it."
p4651
aS"\nDG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.\nIf Australia disappears tomorrow,\nterror is probably the right response.\nThat's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,\nwhen a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,\nmore people than that were killed\nby not using their seatbelts in the same country.\nIs terror the right response?"
p4652
aS"\nCA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --\nthat it's so spectacular?\nIs it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?\nWhat is it?"
p4653
aS"\nDG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.\nFirst, it's a human agent trying to kill us --\nit's not a tree falling on us by accident.\nSecond, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.\nPeople are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --\nas if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.\nSo there are a number of things that together\nmake this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down\nthe fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it\nthey want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,\nwho want these things to be\nas spectacular as they possibly can."
p4654
aS'\nCA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?'
p4655
aS'\nDG: Well, go to Israel. You know,\ngo to Israel. And a mall blows up,\nand then everybody\'s unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --\nat least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall\nwhen it blew up -- I went back to my hotel\nand the wedding that was planned was still going on.\nAnd as the Israeli mother said,\nshe said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."\nI mean, this is a society that has learned --\nand there are others too -- that has learned to live\nwith a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,\nshall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.'
p4656
aS"\nCA: But is there a rational fear that actually,\nthe reason we're frightened about this is because we think that\nthe Big One is to come?"
p4657
aS'\nDG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack\nthere would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --\nwe would probably not be nearly so frightened.\nI don\'t want to say -- please, I\'m going to get quoted somewhere\nas saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn\'t be so distressed."\nThat\'s not my point at all.\nWhat I\'m saying is that, surely, rationally,\nour distress about things that happen, about threats,\nshould be roughly proportional to the size of those threats\nand threats to come.\nI think in the case of terrorism, it isn\'t.\nAnd many of the things we\'ve heard about from our speakers today --\nhow many people do you know got up and said,\nPoverty! I can\'t believe what poverty is doing to us.\nPeople get up in the morning; they don\'t care about poverty.\nIt\'s not making headlines, it\'s not making news, it\'s not flashy.\nThere are no guns going off.\nI mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,\nwhich would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nThat\'s a tough one.'
p4658
aS"\nCA: There's no question.\nPoverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,\nunless someone can show that there's, you know,\nterrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.\nThe latest I've read, seen, thought\nis that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.\nIf that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,\nbut with poverty it's a bit --"
p4659
aS'\nDG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.'
p4660
aS"\nCA: We've evolved to get all excited\nabout these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,\nin the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease\nand systems that cause poverty and so forth,\nand so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy\ninto worrying about those things?\nPeople died; so be it.\nBut if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.\nAnd so we evolved these responses.\nIs that what happened?"
p4661
aS"\nDG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical\nabout leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything\nare the evolutionary psychologists themselves.\nMy guess is that there's nothing quite that specific\nin our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for\nan evolutionary explanation, you might say\nthat most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared\nof stuff that's new and different.\nAnd there's a good reason to be,\nbecause old stuff didn't eat you. Right?\nAny animal you see that you've seen before is less likely\nto be a predator than one that you've never seen before.\nSo, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,\nour general tendency is to orient towards\nthat which is new and novel is activated.\nI don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism\nas the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it."
p4662
aS"\nJay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about\nthe stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect\nyou're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,\nwhich is the error of value.\nI know, because I've interviewed\nabout 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.\nIt turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.\nThat's what you think it is. All right?\nThe average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,\nso the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,\nand yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?\nIt's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.\nIt's because the anticipation of possibly winning\nreleases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling\nuntil the drawing indicates you've lost.\nOr, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,\nyou can have a much better feeling than flushing the money\ndown the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.\nNow, economists tend to --\n(Applause)\n-- economists tend to view the world\nthrough their own lenses, which is:\nthis is just a bunch of stupid people.\nAnd as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.\nAnd so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,\nwe didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.\n(Applause)"
p4663
aS"\nDG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen\nwhether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled\nby the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,\npeople who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,\neven though they don't feel great during the drawing.\nI would disagree that people know they're not going to win.\nI think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,\nwhich is why they prefer that to the flushing.\nBut certainly I see your point: that there can be\nsome utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.\nNow, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.\nThat isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others."

p4666
aS'\nDG: For you or for them?'
p4667
aS'\nAdG: In persuading them.'
p4668
aS'\nDG: Ah, for you in persuading them.\nWell, it\'s notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.\nBut one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work\nis to get people to imagine the future more vividly.\nOne of the problems with making decisions about the far future\nand the near future is that we imagine the near future\nmuch more vividly than the far future.\nTo the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail\nthat people put into the mental representations\nof near and far future, people begin to make decisions\nabout the two in the same way.\nSo, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you\'re 65\nis a question that\'s very different than,\nimagine who you\'ll be when you\'re 65: will you be living,\nwhat will you look like, how much hair will you have,\nwho will you be living with.\nOnce we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,\nsuddenly we feel like it might be important to save\nso that that guy has a little retirement money.\nBut these are tricks around the margins.\nI think in general you\'re battling a very fundamental human tendency,\nwhich is to say, "I\'m here today,\nand so now is more important than later."'

p4714
aS"\nSound familiar?\nDid you know that we Americans\nhave about three times the amount of space\nwe did 50 years ago?\nThree times.\nSo you'd think, with all this extra space,\nwe'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.\nNope.\nThere's a new industry in town,\na 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry:\nthat of personal storage.\nSo we've got triple the space,\nbut we've become such good shoppers\nthat we need even more space.\nSo where does this lead?\nLots of credit card debt,\nhuge environmental footprints,\nand perhaps not coincidentally,\nour happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years."
p4715
aS"\nWell I'm here to suggest there's a better way,\nthat less might actually equal more.\nI bet most of us have experienced at some point\nthe joys of less:\ncollege -- in your dorm,\ntraveling -- in a hotel room,\ncamping -- rig up basically nothing,\nmaybe a boat.\nWhatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,\nthis gave you a little more freedom,\na little more time.\nSo I'm going to suggest\nthat less stuff and less space\nare going to equal a smaller footprint.\nIt's actually a great way to save you some money.\nAnd it's going to give you a little more ease in your life."
p4716
aS"\nSo I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org\nto further this conversation\nand to find some great solutions in this area.\nFirst up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan\nwith partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.\nI wanted it all --\nhome office, sit down dinner for 10,\nroom for guests,\nand all my kite surfing gear.\nWith over 300 entries from around the world,\nI got it, my own little jewel box.\nBy buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.\ninstead of 600,\nimmediately I'm saving 200 grand.\nSmaller space is going to make for smaller utilities --\nsave some more money there,\nbut also a smaller footprint.\nAnd because it's really designed\naround an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff --\nand really designed for me,\nI'm really excited to be there."
p4717
aS'\nSo how can you live little?\nThree main approaches.\nFirst of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.\nWe\'ve got to clear the arteries of our lives.\nAnd that shirt that I hadn\'t worn in years?\nIt\'s time for me to let it go.\nWe\'ve got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,\nand we\'ve got to learn to stem the inflow.\nWe need to think before we buy.\nAsk ourselves,\n"Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"\nBy all means,\nwe should buy and own some great stuff.\nBut we want stuff that we\'re going to love for years,\nnot just stuff.'
p4718
aS"\nSecondly, our new mantra:\nsmall is sexy.\nWe want space efficiency.\nWe want things that are designed\nfor how they're used the vast majority of the time,\nnot that rare event.\nWhy have a six burner stove\nwhen you rarely use three?\nSo we want things that nest,\nwe want things that stack, and we want it digitized.\nYou can take paperwork,\nbooks, movies,\nand you can make it disappear -- it's magic."
p4719
aS'\nFinally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares --\na sink combined with a toilet,\na dining table becomes a bed --\nsame space,\na little side table\nstretches out to seat 10.\nIn the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here,\nwe combine a moving wall with transformer furniture\nto get a lot out of the space.\nLook at the coffee table --\nit grows in height and width\nto seat 10.\nMy office folds away,\neasily hidden.\nMy bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.\nGuests? Move the moving wall,\nhave some fold-down guest beds.\nAnd of course, my own movie theater.'
p4720
aS'\nSo I\'m not saying that we all need to live\nin 420 sq. ft.\nBut consider the benefits of an edited life.\nGo from 3,000 to 2,000,\nfrom 1,500 to 1,000.\nMost of us, maybe all of us,\nare here pretty happily for a bunch of days\nwith a couple of bags,\nmaybe a small space, a hotel room.\nSo when you go home and you walk through your front door,\ntake a second and ask yourselves,\n"Could I do with a little life editing?\nWould that give me a little more freedom?\nMaybe a little more time?"'
p4721
aS"\nWhat's in the box?\nIt doesn't really matter.\nI know I don't need it.\nWhat's in yours?\nMaybe, just maybe,\nless might equal more.\nSo let's make room\nfor the good stuff."

S"\nThere's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.\nSo let's start talking about that.\nI wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.\nThat's what I have behind myself."
p4726
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4727
aS"\nBut of course what we have to remember is this.\nAnd what you have to think about is,\nwhen you're dancing in the flames, what's next?\nSo what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes\nis I'm going to talk first about the flames --\nwhere we are in the economy --\nand then I'm going to take three trends\nthat have taken place at TED over the last 25 years\nand that will take place in this conference\nand I will try and bring them together.\nAnd I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.\nThose three trends are\nthe ability to engineer cells,\nthe ability to engineer tissues,\nand robots.\nAnd somehow it will all make sense."
p4728
aS"\nBut anyway, let's start with the economy.\nThere's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.\nOne is leverage.\nAnd the problem with leverage is\nit makes the U.S. financial system look like this."
p4729
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4730
aS"\nSo, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.\nThat means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.\nA normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,\nit's an investment bank;\nit has 15 to 20 times.\nIt turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.\nAnd your friendly Citibank had 47 times.\nOops.\nThat means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.\nAnd that, of course, is the reason why all of you\nare making such generous and wonderful donations\nto these nice folks.\nAnd as you think about that,\nyou've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?\n(Laughter)\nIt ain't pretty."
p4731
aS'\nThe government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.\nWe all love Santa Claus, right?\nBut the problem with Santa Clause is,\nif you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing\nand promising folks,\nit turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending\non what we call "entitlements."\nAnd then by 2007 it was 68 percent.\nAnd we weren\'t supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.\nExcept we\'ve been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,\nthat we\'ve brought that date of reckoning forward\nto about 2017.\nAnd we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,\nbut, guess what?\nWe\'re going to start to pay them.\nAnd the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill\'s come due,\nit turns out Santa isn\'t quite as cute when it\'s summertime.\nRight?'

aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4733
aS"\nHere's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.\nThis guy runs the China Investment Corporation.\nHe is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.\nAnd he gave an interview in December.\nHere's his first bit of advice.\nAnd here's his second bit of advice.\nAnd, by the way,\nthe Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.\nThis stuff is getting serious enough\nthat if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,\nwe're going to end up losing the dollar.\nAnd then all bets are off."
p4734
aS'\nLet me show you what it looks like.\nI think I can safely say\nthat I\'m the only trillionaire in this room.\nThis is an actual bill.\nAnd it\'s 10 triliion dollars.\nThe only problem with this bill is it\'s not really worth very much.\nThat was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,\na buck next week.\nAnd that\'s what happens to currencies when you don\'t stand behind them.\nSo the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,\nand sometimes this creature\'s called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --\nyou\'ve just got to say no.\nAnd you\'ve got to start banishing a word that\'s called "entitlement."\nAnd the reason we have to do that in the short term\nis because we have just run out of cash.'
p4735
aS"\nIf you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.\nThe orange slice is what's discretionary.\nEverything else is mandated.\nIt makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.\nSo what we have to start thinking about doing\nis capping our medical spending\nbecause that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.\nWe've got to start thinking about asking people\nto retire a little bit later.\nIf you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.\nYour 401(k) just got nailed.\nIf you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.\nIf you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.\nThe reason why that's reasonable is,\nwhen your grandparents were given Social Security,\nthey got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.\nSixty-eight is young today.\nWe've also got to cut the military about three percent a year."
p4736
aS"\nWe've got to limit other mandatory spending.\nWe've got to quit borrowing as much,\nbecause otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.\nAnd we've got to end up with a smaller government.\nAnd if we don't start changing this trend line,\nwe are going to lose the dollar\nand start to look like Iceland.\nI got what you're thinking.\nThis is going to happen when hell freezes over.\nBut let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas."

aS"\nHere's what happens if you don't address this stuff.\nSo, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis\nback in the late '80s.\nAnd its 225 largest companies today\nare worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.\nWe don't fix this now,\nhow would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?\nBecause that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.\nAnd unless you want this person\nto not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,\nwe'd better deal with this stuff.\nThat's the short term. That's the flame part.\nThat's the financial crisis."
p4739
aS"\nNow, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave\nthat we need to talk about.\nThat wave is much larger, much more powerful,\nand that's of course the wave of technology.\nAnd what's really important in this stuff is,\nas we cut, we also have to grow.\nAmong other things, because startup companies\nare .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm\nand they're about 17.8 percent of output.\nIt's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.\nAnd that's what we've got to keep growing.\nWe don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.\nSo let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.\nAnd that's where these three trends come together.\nThat's where the ability to engineer microbes,\nthe ability to engineer tissues,\nand the ability to engineer robots\nbegin to lead to a reboot.\nAnd let me recap some of the stuff you've seen."
p4740
aS'\nCraig Venter showed up last year\nand showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware\nwhere you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.\nIn parallel, the folks at MIT\nhave been building a standard registry of biological parts.\nSo think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.\nYou can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.\nAnd start building stuff.\nIn 2006 they brought together high school students and college students\nand started to build these little odd creatures.\nThey just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.'
p4741
aS"\nHere was one of the first things they built.\nSo, cells have this cycle.\nFirst they don't grow.\nThen they grow exponentially.\nThen they stop growing.\nGraduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.\nSo they engineered these cells\nso that when they're growing in the exponential phase,\nthey would smell like wintergreen.\nAnd when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.\nAnd you could tell very easily when your experiment was working\nand wasn't, and where it was in the phase."
p4742
aS'\nThis got a bit more complicated two years later.\nTwenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.\nThey started competing.\nThe team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine\nthat makes red wine good for you\ninto beer.\nSo you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.\nOf course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,\n"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."'
p4743
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4744
aS"\nThe team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.\nThey tried to engineer bacterias in such a way\nthat they would act as your kidneys.\nFour years ago, I showed you this picture.\nAnd people oohed and ahhed,\nbecause Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.\nAnd that was very cool stuff back then.\nBut now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,\nlet me show you what's happened in that period of time."
p4745
aS"\nTwo years ago, you saw this creature.\nAn almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico\ncalled an axolotl\nthat can re-generate its limbs.\nYou can freeze half its heart. It regrows.\nYou can freeze half the brain. It regrows.\nIt's almost like leaving Congress.\n(Laughter)\nBut now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,\nbecause you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.\nAnd, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,\nyou can grow human molars in Petri dishes.\nThis should not surprise you, right?\nI mean, you're born with no teeth.\nYou give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.\nYou re-grow a set of teeth.\nBut then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,\nunless, if you're a lawyer."
p4746
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4747
aS"\nBut, of course, for most of us,\nwe know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,\nput them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,\nand simply implant it.\nAnd we can do it with other things.\nSo, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,\nthey took all the cells off the trachea,\nthey spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.\nShe regrew her own trachea,\nand 72 hours later it was implanted.\nShe's now running around with her kids.\nThis is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest\nwhere he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,\nand he's also re-growing bladders.\nSo there are now nine women walking around Boston\nwith re-grown bladders,\nwhich is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags\nfor the rest of your life."
p4748
aS"\nThis is kind of getting boring, right?\nI mean, you understand where this story's going.\nBut, I mean it gets more interesting.\nLast year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,\nleaving just the cartilage.\nThen, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.\nThose stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.\nLife happens."
p4749
aS"\nThis may be one of the ultimate papers.\nThis was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,\nand it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.\nThat meant that you can take the stuff right here,\nand turn it into almost anything in your body.\nAnd this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,\nit's moving in a whole series of places."
p4750
aS'\nThird trend: robots.\nThose of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now\nwe would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.\nAnd all we\'ve got is a Roomba.\n(Laughter)\nWe also thought we\'d have this robot to warn us of danger.\nDidn\'t happen.\nAnd these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?\nSo, Rosie runs around on skates\nand the other one ran on flat threads.\nIf you don\'t have a flat world, that\'s not good,\nwhich is why the robot\'s we\'re designing today are a little different.'
p4751
aS'\nThis is Boston Dynamics\' "BigDog."\nAnd this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.\nO.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you\'ve got a wall,\nyou\'re talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,\nand when you don\'t know if that thing is human or animal --\nthat\'s when computers have reached human intelligence.\nThis is not an intelligence Turing rest,\nbut this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.\nAnd this stuff is moving very quickly,\nand by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.\nThese are not the only interesting robots.\nYou\'ve also got flies, the size of flies,\nthat are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.\nYou\'ve got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.\nAnd as you bring these things together,\nas you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,\nyou begin to get some really odd questions.'
p4752
aS"\nIn the last Olympics, this gentleman,\nwho had several world records in the Special Olympics,\ntried to run in the normal Olympics.\nThe only issue with Oscar Pistorius\nis he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.\nHe came within about a second of qualifying.\nHe sued to be allowed to run,\nand he won the suit,\nbut didn't qualify by time.\nNext Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,\nis going to make the time.\nAnd two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable."
p4753
aS"\nAnd as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means\nto take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --\nI mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?\nI mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,\nand then your parents had these odd boxes\nthat would squawk at odd times during dinner,\nand now we have these little buds that nobody sees.\nAnd now you have cochlear implants\nthat go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.\nNow, they can't hear as well as you and I can.\nBut, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,\nand these are machine generations, not human generations.\nAnd about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,\nthey'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,\nor how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.\nThey'll be able to focus their hearing,\nthey'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,\ndo a series of things that we can't do."
p4754
aS"\nAnd the same thing is happening in eyes.\nThis is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes\nso that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.\nVery primitive.\nAnd then they'll be able to see shape.\nAnd then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,\nand one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.\nAnd a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,\nthey'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,\nthey'll be able to come into a microfocus.\nThey'll do stuff you and I can't do.\nAll of these things are coming together,\nand it's a particularly important thing to understand,\nas we worry about the flames of the present,\nto keep an eye on the future."
p4755
aS'\nAnd, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,\nbecause next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin\'s birth.\nAnd it\'s the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."\nAnd Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.\nIt is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.\nThere have actually been 22 species of hominids\nthat have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,\nhave gone extinct.\nIt is common for hominids to evolve.\nAnd that\'s the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,\nerectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,\nand Homo sapiens, all overlap.\nThe common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,\nnot one.'
p4756
aS"\nAnd as you think of the implications of that,\nhere's a brief history of the universe.\nThe universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,\nand then you created all the stars, and all the planets,\nand all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.\nAnd then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,\nand then you got life about four billion years ago,\nand then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,\nand then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.\nTa-dah!\nMaybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,\nand all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,\nand all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff\nis to create what's in this room.\nMaybe not.\nThat would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.\n(Laughter)\nSo, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?\n(Laughter)"
p4757
aS"\nI think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.\nI think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.\nAnd I think this isn't 1,000 years out.\nI think most of us are going to glance at it,\nand our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.\nAnd a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends\ninto a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control\nover the evolution of his species, her species and other species.\nAnd that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot."

S"\nI've always had a fascination for computers and technology,\nand I made a few apps for the iPhone,\niPod Touch, and iPad.\nI'd like to share a couple with you today.\nMy first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune\nthat would display different colors of earth\ndepending on what your fortune was.\nMy favorite and most successful app is\nBustin Jieber, which is  (Laughter) \nwhich is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole.\nI created it because a lot of people at school\ndisliked Justin Bieber a little bit,\nso I decided to make the app.\nSo I went to work programming it,\nand I released it just before the holidays in 2010.\nA lot of people ask me, how did I make these?\nA lot of times it's because the person who asked\nthe question wants to make an app also.\nA lot of kids these days like to play games,\nbut now they want to make them,\nand it's difficult,\nbecause not many kids know where to go\nto find out how to make a program.\nI mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team.\nFor violin, you could get lessons for a violin.\nBut what if you want to make an app?\nAnd their parents, the kid's parents might have done\nsome of these things when they were young,\nbut not many parents have written apps. (Laughter)\nWhere do you go to find out how to make an app?\nWell, this is how I approached it. This is what I did.\nFirst of all, I've been programming in multiple\nother programming languages to get the basics down,\nsuch as Python, C, Java, etc.\nAnd then Apple released the iPhone,\nand with it, the iPhone software development kit,\nand the software development kit is a suite of tools\nfor creating and programming an iPhone app.\nThis opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me,\nand after playing with the software development kit\na little bit, I made a couple apps, I made some test apps.\nOne of them happened to be Earth Fortune, and I was\nready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store,\nand so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee\nto be able to put my apps on the App Store.\nThey agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store.\nI've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement\nfrom my family, friends, teachers\nand even people at the Apple Store,\nand that's been a huge help to me.\nI've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs,\nand I've started an app club at school, and a teacher\nat my school is kindly sponsoring my app club.\nAny student at my school can come and\nlearn how to design an app.\nThis is so I can share my experiences with others.\nThere's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program,\nand some districts have them.\nI'm fortunate enough to be part of one.\nA big challenge is, how should the iPads be used,\nand what apps should we put on the iPads?\nSo we're getting feedback from teachers at the school\nto see what kind of apps they'd like.\nWhen we design the app and we sell it,\nit will be free to local districts and other districts\nthat we sell to, all the money from that will go into\nthe local ed foundations.\nThese days, students usually know a little bit more\nthan teachers with the technology. (Laughter)\nSo -- (Laughter) --\nsorry -- (Laughter) --\nso this is a resource to teachers, and educators\nshould recognize this resource and make good use of it.\nI'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.\nFirst of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.\nI'm working with a third party company to make an app.\nI'd like to get into Android programming and development,\nand I'd like to continue my app club,\nand find other ways for students\nto share knowledge with others.

S'\nSo why do we learn mathematics?\nEssentially, for three reasons:\ncalculation,\napplication,\nand last, and unfortunately least\nin terms of the time we give it,\ninspiration.'
p4763
aS'\nMathematics is the science of patterns,\nand we study it to learn how to think logically,\ncritically and creatively,\nbut too much of the mathematics\nthat we learn in school\nis not effectively motivated,\nand when our students ask,\n"Why are we learning this?"\nthen they often hear that they\'ll need it\nin an upcoming math class or on a future test.\nBut wouldn\'t it be great\nif every once in a while we did mathematics\nsimply because it was fun or beautiful\nor because it excited the mind?\nNow, I know many people have not\nhad the opportunity to see how this can happen,\nso let me give you a quick example\nwith my favorite collection of numbers,\nthe Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)'
p4764
aS"\nYeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.\nThat's great."
p4765
aS'\nNow these numbers can be appreciated\nin many different ways.\nFrom the standpoint of calculation,\nthey\'re as easy to understand\nas one plus one, which is two.\nThen one plus two is three,\ntwo plus three is five, three plus five is eight,\nand so on.\nIndeed, the person we call Fibonacci\nwas actually named Leonardo of Pisa,\nand these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,"\nwhich taught the Western world\nthe methods of arithmetic that we use today.\nIn terms of applications,\nFibonacci numbers appear in nature\nsurprisingly often.\nThe number of petals on a flower\nis typically a Fibonacci number,\nor the number of spirals on a sunflower\nor a pineapple\ntends to be a Fibonacci number as well.'
p4766
aS"\nIn fact, there are many more\napplications of Fibonacci numbers,\nbut what I find most inspirational about them\nare the beautiful number patterns they display.\nLet me show you one of my favorites.\nSuppose you like to square numbers,\nand frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)"
p4767
aS"\nLet's look at the squares\nof the first few Fibonacci numbers.\nSo one squared is one,\ntwo squared is four, three squared is nine,\nfive squared is 25, and so on.\nNow, it's no surprise\nthat when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,\nyou get the next Fibonacci number. Right?\nThat's how they're created.\nBut you wouldn't expect anything special\nto happen when you add the squares together.\nBut check this out.\nOne plus one gives us two,\nand one plus four gives us five.\nAnd four plus nine is 13,\nnine plus 25 is 34,\nand yes, the pattern continues."
p4768
aS"\nIn fact, here's another one.\nSuppose you wanted to look at\nadding the squares of\nthe first few Fibonacci numbers.\nLet's see what we get there.\nSo one plus one plus four is six.\nAdd nine to that, we get 15.\nAdd 25, we get 40.\nAdd 64, we get 104.\nNow look at those numbers.\nThose are not Fibonacci numbers,\nbut if you look at them closely,\nyou'll see the Fibonacci numbers\nburied inside of them."
p4769
aS"\nDo you see it? I'll show it to you.\nSix is two times three, 15 is three times five,\n40 is five times eight,\ntwo, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?"
p4770
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4771
aS'\nFibonacci! Of course.'
p4772
aS"\nNow, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,\nit's even more satisfying to understand\nwhy they are true.\nLet's look at that last equation.\nWhy should the squares of one, one,\ntwo, three, five and eight\nadd up to eight times 13?\nI'll show you by drawing a simple picture.\nWe'll start with a one-by-one square\nand next to that put another one-by-one square.\nTogether, they form a one-by-two rectangle.\nBeneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,\nand next to that, a three-by-three square,\nbeneath that, a five-by-five square,\nand then an eight-by-eight square,\ncreating one giant rectangle, right?"
p4773
aS"\nNow let me ask you a simple question:\nwhat is the area of the rectangle?\nWell, on the one hand,\nit's the sum of the areas\nof the squares inside it, right?\nJust as we created it.\nIt's one squared plus one squared\nplus two squared plus three squared\nplus five squared plus eight squared. Right?\nThat's the area.\nOn the other hand, because it's a rectangle,\nthe area is equal to its height times its base,\nand the height is clearly eight,\nand the base is five plus eight,\nwhich is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?\nSo the area is also eight times 13.\nSince we've correctly calculated the area\ntwo different ways,\nthey have to be the same number,\nand that's why the squares of one,\none, two, three, five and eight\nadd up to eight times 13."
p4774
aS"\nNow, if we continue this process,\nwe'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,\n21 by 34, and so on."
p4775
aS'\nNow check this out.\nIf you divide 13 by eight,\nyou get 1.625.\nAnd if you divide the larger number\nby the smaller number,\nthen these ratios get closer and closer\nto about 1.618,\nknown to many people as the Golden Ratio,\na number which has fascinated mathematicians,\nscientists and artists for centuries.'
p4776
aS"\nNow, I show all this to you because,\nlike so much of mathematics,\nthere's a beautiful side to it\nthat I fear does not get enough attention\nin our schools.\nWe spend lots of time learning about calculation,\nbut let's not forget about application,\nincluding, perhaps, the most\nimportant application of all,\nlearning how to think."

S'\nI grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me\nwhen I was between seven and 10 years old.\nAnd I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew\nwere able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --\nhow few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,\nsatisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security\nwas destroyed by the war.\nSo I became interested in understanding\nwhat contributed to a life that was worth living.\nAnd I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy\nand to get involved in art and religion and many other ways\nthat I could see as a possible answer to that question.\nAnd finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.'
p4782
aS"\nI was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money\nto actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and\nI didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --\nI read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation\nby someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,\nand it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.\nAnd I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,\nat least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.\nAnd the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.\nInstead of talking about little green men,\nhe talked about how the psyche of the Europeans\nhad been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting\nflying saucers into the sky.\nHe talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion\nwere kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain\nsome sense of order after the chaos of war.\nAnd this seemed very interesting to me.\nAnd I started reading his books after that lecture.\nAnd that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about."
p4783
aS"\nThen I came to this country to study psychology\nand I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.\nThis is a typical result that many people have presented,\nand there are many variations on it.\nBut this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people\nsurveyed in the United States since 1956\nsay that their life is very happy.\nAnd that hasn't changed at all.\nWhereas the personal income,\non a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,\nhas more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.\nBut you find essentially the same results,\nnamely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less\nto just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --\nincreases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.\nIn fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,\nmaterial resources, contributes to unhappiness,\nbut the increase in material resources does not increase happiness."
p4784
aS"\nSo my research has been focused more on --\nafter finding out these things that actually corresponded\nto my own experience, I tried to understand:\nwhere -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --\ndo we feel really happy?\nAnd to start\nthose studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --\nfirst artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand\nwhat made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life\ndoing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,\nbut which made their life meaningful and worth doing."

aS"\nThis was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.\nAnd the interview was 40 pages long.\nBut this little excerpt is a very good summary\nof what he was saying during the interview.\nAnd it describes how he feels when composing is going well.\nAnd he says by describing it as an ecstatic state."
p4786
aS'\nNow, "ecstasy" in Greek meant\nsimply to stand to the side of something.\nAnd then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state\nwhere you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.\nSo ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.\nAnd it\'s interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about\nthe civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --\nwhether it\'s China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,\nor the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them\nis really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.\nWe know the temples they built, where people could come\nto experience a different reality.\nWe know about the circuses,\nthe arenas, the theaters.\nThese are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went\nto experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.'
p4787
aS"\nNow, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,\nwhich is also -- this place, this arena, which is built\nlike a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.\nWe are participating in a reality that is different\nfrom that of the everyday life that we're used to.\nBut this man doesn't need to go there.\nHe needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,\nand as he does that, he can imagine sounds\nthat had not existed before in that particular combination.\nSo once he gets to that point of beginning to create,\nlike Jennifer did in her improvisation,\na new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --\nhe enters that different reality.\nNow he says also that this is so intense an experience\nthat it feels almost as if he didn't exist.\nAnd that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.\nBut actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing\nmore than about 110 bits of information per second.\nAnd in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,\nyou need to process about 60 bits per second.\nThat's why you can't hear more than two people.\nYou can't understand more than two people talking to you."
p4788
aS"\nWell, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process\nof creating something new, as this man is,\nhe doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor\nhow his body feels, or his problems at home.\nHe can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.\nHis body disappears,\nhis identity disappears from his consciousness,\nbecause he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,\nto really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,\nand at the same time to feel that he exists.\nSo existence is temporarily suspended.\nAnd he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.\nNow, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel\nany awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)"
p4789
aS'\nSo what it\'s telling you here\nis that obviously this automatic,\nspontaneous process that he\'s describing can only happen to someone\nwho is very well trained and who has developed technique.\nAnd it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity\nthat you can\'t be creating anything with less than 10 years\nof technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.\nWhether it\'s mathematics or music, it takes that long\nto be able to begin to change something in a way that it\'s better\nthan what was there before.\nNow, when that happens,\nhe says the music just flows out.\nAnd because all of these people I started interviewing --\nthis was an interview which is over 30 years old --\nso many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow\nthat I called this type of experience the "flow experience."\nAnd it happens in different realms.'
p4790
aS"\nFor instance, a poet describes it in this form.\nThis is by a student of mine who interviewed\nsome of the leading writers and poets in the United States.\nAnd it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling\nthat you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.\nThis poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --\na very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave\nas to how he imagined the forces of relativity,\nwhen he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.\nBut it happens in other activities.\nFor instance, this is another student of mine,\nSusan Jackson from Australia, who did work\nwith some of the leading athletes in the world.\nAnd you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,\nthe same essential description of the phenomenology\nof the inner state of the person.\nYou don't think; it goes automatically,\nif you merge yourself with the music, and so forth."
p4791
aS'\nIt happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,\ncalled "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs\nwho had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful\nand very ethical, very socially responsible.\nYou see that these people define success\nas something that helps others and at the same time\nmakes you feel happy as you are working at it.\nAnd like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,\nyou can\'t have just one of these things be successful\nif you want a meaningful and successful job.\nAnita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.\nShe is the founder of Body Shop,\nthe natural cosmetics king.\nIt\'s kind of a passion that comes\nfrom doing the best and having flow while you\'re working.'
p4792
aS"\nThis is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,\nwho was at that time starting out Sony without any money,\nwithout a product -- they didn't have a product,\nthey didn't have anything, but they had an idea.\nAnd the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers\ncan feel the joy of technological innovation,\nbe aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.\nI couldn't improve on this as a good example\nof how flow enters the workplace."
p4793
aS"\nNow, when we do studies --\nwe have, with other colleagues around the world,\ndone over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,\nto blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --\nwho enjoy their work.\nAnd regardless of the culture,\nregardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions\nthat seem to be there when a person is in flow.\nThere's this focus that, once it becomes intense,\nleads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:\nyou know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;\nyou get immediate feedback.\nYou know that what you need to do\nis possible to do, even though difficult,\nand sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,\nyou feel part of something larger.\nAnd once the conditions are present,\nwhat you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake."
p4794
aS"\nIn our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.\nAnd we can measure this very precisely, actually,\nbecause we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,\nand whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,\nwhere you are, what you're thinking about.\nAnd two things that we measure is the amount of challenge\npeople experience at that moment and the amount of skill\nthat they feel they have at that moment.\nSo for each person we can establish an average,\nwhich is the center of the diagram.\nThat would be your mean level of challenge and skill,\nwhich will be different from that of anybody else.\nBut you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle."
p4795
aS'\nIf we know what that set point is,\nwe can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,\nand it will be when your challenges are higher than average\nand skills are higher than average.\nAnd you may be doing things very differently from other people,\nbut for everyone that flow channel, that area there,\nwill be when you are doing what you really like to do --\nplay the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,\nif work is what provides flow for you.\nAnd then the other areas become less and less positive.'
p4796
aS"\nArousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.\nYour skills are not quite as high as they should be,\nbut you can move into flow fairly easily\nby just developing a little more skill.\nSo, arousal is the area where most people learn from,\nbecause that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone\nand to enter that -- going back to flow --\nthen they develop higher skills.\nControl is also a good place to be,\nbecause there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.\nIt's not very challenging any more.\nAnd if you want to enter flow from control,\nyou have to increase the challenges.\nSo those two are ideal and complementary areas\nfrom which flow is easy to go into."
p4797
aS"\nThe other combinations of challenge and skill\nbecome progressively less optimal.\nRelaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.\nBoredom begins to be very aversive\nand apathy becomes very negative:\nyou don't feel that you're doing anything,\nyou don't use your skills, there's no challenge.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.\nThe largest single contributor to that experience\nis watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.\nEven though sometimes watching television\nabout seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,\nbut that's when you choose a program you really want to watch\nand you get feedback from it."
p4798
aS"\nSo the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --\nis how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.\nAnd that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.\nAnd some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously\nwithout any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.\nAnd that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do."

S"\nI started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago\nwhen I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.\nBecause I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,\nso I decided to create my own in public places."
p4828
aS'\nSo the first project we\'re going to take a look at\nis the very first No Pants Subway Ride.\nNow this took place in January of 2002.\nAnd this woman is the star of the video.\nShe doesn\'t know she\'s being filmed.\nShe\'s being filmed with a hidden camera.\nThis is on the 6 train in New York City.\nAnd this is the first stop along the line.\nThese are two Danish guys\nwho come out and sit down next to the hidden camera.\nAnd that\'s me right there in a brown coat.\nIt\'s about 30 degrees outside.\nI\'m wearing a hat. I\'m wearing a scarf.\nAnd the girl\'s going to notice me right here.\n(Laughter)\nAnd as you\'ll see now, I\'m not wearing pants.\n(Laughter)\nSo at this point --\nat this point she\'s noticed me,\nbut in New York there\'s weirdos on any given train car.\nOne person\'s not that unusual.\nShe goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."\n(Laughter)\nSo she\'s noticed the unusual thing,\nbut she\'s gone back to her normal life.'
p4829
aS"\nNow in the meantime, I have six friends\nwho are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.\nThey're going to be entering this car one by one.\nWe'll act as though we don't know each other.\nAnd we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made,\nforgetting our pants on this cold January day.\n(Laughter)\nSo at this point,\nshe decides to put the rape book away.\n(Laughter)\nAnd she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings."
p4830
aS"\nNow in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,\nthey're cracking up.\nThey think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.\nAnd watch her make eye contact with them right about now.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I love that moment in this video,\nbecause before it became a shared experience,\nit was something that was maybe a little bit scary,\nor something that was at least confusing to her.\nAnd then once it became a shared experience,\nit was funny and something that she could laugh at."
p4831
aS'\nSo the train is now pulling into\nthe third stop along the 6 line.\n(Laughter)\nSo the video won\'t show everything.\nThis goes on for another four stops.\nA total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.\nAt the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag\nand announced she had pants for sale for a dollar --\nlike you might sell batteries or candy on the train.\nWe all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them on\nand said, "Thank you. That\'s exactly what I needed today,"\nand then exited without revealing what had happened\nand went in all different directions.'
p4832
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4833
aS'\nThank you.'
p4834
aS"\nSo that's a still from the video there.\nAnd I love that girl's reaction so much.\nAnd watching that videotape later that day\ninspired me to keep doing what I do.\nAnd really one of the points of Improv Everywhere\nis to cause a scene in a public place\nthat is a positive experience for other people.\nIt's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.\nAnd her reaction inspired me\nto do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.\nAnd we've continued to do it every year.\nThis January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride\nwhere a diverse group of 3,500 people\nrode the train in their underwear in New York --\nalmost every single train line in the city.\nAnd also in 50 other cities around the world,\npeople participated."
p4835
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4836
aS"\nAs I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater\nand meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,\nI started amassing a mailing list\nof people who wanted to do these types of projects.\nSo I could do more large-scale projects.\nWell one day I was walking through Union Square,\nand I saw this building,\nwhich had just been built in 2005.\nAnd there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.\nAnd it was very peculiar,\nbecause it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting,\nand she was very much onstage,\nand I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.\nAfter about 15 seconds, her friend appeared --\nshe had been hiding behind a display --\nand they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.\nSo it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.\nSo I got inspired by that.\nLooking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows --\nand I knew what I had to do."
p4837
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4838
aS'\nSo this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.\nThis was completely unauthorized.\nWe didn\'t let the stores know we were coming.\nAnd I stood in the park giving signals.\nThe first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters\nthat spelled out "Look Up More,"\nthe name of the project.\nThe second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together.\nYou\'ll see that start right here.\n(Laughter)\nAnd then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.\nAnd then we had dance solos where only one person would dance\nand everybody would point to them.\n(Laughter)\nSo then I gave a new hand signal,\nwhich signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,\nand he danced.\nThere were several other activities.\nWe had people jumping up and down,\npeople dropping to the ground.\nAnd I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,\nputting my hand on and off of a trashcan\nto signal the advancement.\nAnd because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,\nthere were hundreds of people by the end\nwho stopped and looked up\nand watched what we were doing.\nThere\'s a better photo of it.'
p4839
aS'\nSo that particular event\nwas inspired by a moment\nthat I happened to stumble upon.\nThe next project I want to show\nwas given to me in an email from a stranger.\nA high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006\nand said, "You should get as many people as possible\nto put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants\nand go into a Best Buy and stand around."\n(Laughter)\n(Applause)\nSo I wrote this high school kid back immediately,\nand I said, "Yes, you are correct.\nI think I\'ll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."\nSo here\'s the video.'
p4840
aS'\nSo again, this is 2005.\nThis is the Best Buy in New York City.\nWe had about 80 people show up to participate,\nentering one-by-one.\nThere was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl.\nThere was also a 65 year-old man\nwho participated.\nSo a very diverse group of people.\nAnd I told people, "Don\'t work. Don\'t actually do work.\nBut also, don\'t shop.\nJust stand around and don\'t face products."\nNow you can see the regular employees\nby the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.\nEverybody else is one of our actors.\n(Laughter)\nThe lower level employees thought it was very funny.\nAnd in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room\nand took photos with us.\nA lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back\nto get heavy television sets for customers.\nThe managers and the security guards, on the other hand,\ndid not find it particularly funny.\nYou can see them in this footage.\nThey\'re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.\nAnd we were there probably 10 minutes\nbefore the managers decided to dial 911.'
p4841
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4842
aS"\nSo they started running around\ntelling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.\nAnd you can see the cops in this footage right here.\nThat's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.\nUltimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management\nthat it was not, in fact, illegal\nto wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants."
p4843
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4844
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4845
aS'\nThank you.'
p4846
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4847
aS'\nSo we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.\nOne thing the managers were trying to do\nwas to track down our cameras.\nAnd they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.\nBut the one camera guy they never caught\nwas the guy that went in just with a blank tape\nand went over to the Best Buy camera department\nand just put his tape in one of their cameras\nand pretended to shop.\nSo I like that concept of using their own technology against them.'
p4848
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4849
aS"\nI think our best projects are ones that are site specific\nand happen at a particular place for a reason.\nAnd one morning, I was riding the subway.\nI had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop\nwhere there are these two giant escalators.\nAnd it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.\nSo I decided to try and stage something\nthat could make it as happy as possible for one morning.\nSo this was in the winter of 2009 --\n8:30 in the morning.\nIt's morning rush hour.\nIt's very cold outside.\nPeople are coming in from Queens,\ntransferring from the E train to the 6 train.\nAnd they're going up these giant escalators\non their way to their jobs."
p4850
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4851
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4852
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4853
aS"\nThank you.\nSo there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.\nHe gave 2,000 high fives that day,\nand he washed his hands before and afterward\nand did not get sick.\nAnd that was done also without permission,\nalthough no one seemed to care."
p4854
aS'\nSo I\'d say over the years,\none of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere\nleft anonymously on YouTube comments\nis: "These people have too much time on their hands."\nAnd you know, not everybody\'s going to like everything you do,\nand I\'ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,\nbut that one\'s always bothered me,\nbecause we don\'t have too much time on our hands.\nThe participants at Improv Everywhere events\nhave just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,\nthey just occasionally choose\nto spend it in an unusual way.'
p4855
aS'\nYou know, every Saturday and Sunday,\nhundreds of thousands of people each fall\ngather in football stadiums to watch games.\nAnd I\'ve never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,\nsaying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."\nAnd of course they don\'t.\nIt\'s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,\nwatching a football game in a stadium.\nBut I think it\'s also a perfectly valid way\nto spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people\nin the Grand Central terminal\nor dressing up like a ghostbuster\nand running through the New York Public Library.\n(Laughter)\nOr listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people\nand dancing silently in a park,\nor bursting into song in a grocery store\nas part of a spontaneous musical,\nor diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.'
p4856
aS"\nYou know, as kids, we're taught to play.\nAnd we're never given a reason why we should play.\nIt's just acceptable that play is a good thing.\nAnd I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.\nIt's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.\nWe don't need a reason.\nAs long as it's fun\nand it seems like it's going to be a funny idea\nand it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time,\nthen that's enough for us.\nAnd I think, as adults, we need to learn\nthat there's no right or wrong way to play."

p4863
aS"\nI don't even think of it"
p4864

p4867
aS'\nTheres no misdirected intention'
p4868
aS'\nPay attention'

aS'\nYo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples'
p4879
aS'\nYes, I have decided to treat\nall three of my languages as equals'
p4880
aS'\nBecause Im articulate'
p4881
aS'\nBut who controls articulation?'
p4882
aS'\nBecause the English language\nis a multifaceted oration'

p4885

aS'\nI stop him and say Noooo '
p4888
aS'\nYoure being inarticulate \nthe proper way is to say whats good'
p4889
aS'\nNow you may think thats too hood, thats not cool'
p4890
aS'\nBut Im here to tell you that\neven our language has rules'
p4891
aS'\nSo when Mommy mocks me and says\nyall-be-madd-going-to-the-store'
p4892
aS'\nI say Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law'
p4893
aS'\nNever does the word "madd" go \nbefore a present participle'

aS'\nThats simply the principle of this English'
p4895
aS'\nIf I had the vocal capacity I would\nsing this from every mountaintop,'
p4896

aS'\nBut do not judge me by my language and assume'
p4901
aS'\nThat Im too ignorant to teach'
p4902

S"\nThe recent debate over copyright laws\nlike SOPA in the United States\nand the ACTA agreement in Europe\nhas been very emotional.\nAnd I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning\ncould really bring a great deal to the debate.\nI'd therefore like to propose\nthat we employ, we enlist,\nthe cutting edge field of copyright math\nwhenever we approach this subject."
p4942
aS"\nFor instance, just recently\nthe Motion Picture Association revealed\nthat our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year\nto copyright theft.\nNow rather than just argue about this number,\na copyright mathematician will analyze it\nand he'll soon discover that this money\ncould stretch from this auditorium\nall the way across Ocean Boulevard\nto the Westin, and then to Mars ...\n(Laughter)\n... if we use pennies."
p4943
aS"\nNow this is obviously a powerful,\nsome might say dangerously powerful, insight.\nBut it's also a morally important one.\nBecause this isn't just the hypothetical retail value\nof some pirated movies that we're talking about,\nbut this is actual economic losses.\nThis is the equivalent\nto the entire American corn crop failing\nalong with all of our fruit crops,\nas well as wheat, tobacco,\nrice, sorghum --\nwhatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum."
p4944
aS"\nBut identifying the actual losses to the economy\nis almost impossible to do\nunless we use copyright math.\nNow music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year\nsince Napster first came on the scene.\nSo that's a chunk of what we're looking for.\nBut total movie revenues\nacross theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.\nAnd TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.\nOther content markets like book publishing and radio\nare also up.\nSo this small missing chunk here\nis puzzling."
p4945
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4946
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4947
aS"\nSince the big content markets\nhave grown in line with historic norms,\nit's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,\nbut copyright math tells us\nit must therefore be foregone growth\nin a market that has no historic norms --\none that didn't exist in the 90's.\nWhat we're looking at here\nis the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.\n(Laughter)\n50 billion dollars of it a year,\nwhich is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,\nthat could stretch from here\nto Neanderthal times.\n(Laughter)\nIt's true.\n(Applause)\nI have Excel."
p4948
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4949
aS"\nThe movie folks also tell us\nthat our economy loses\nover 370,000 jobs to content theft,\nwhich is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated\nthat the motion picture and video industries\nwere employing 270,000 people.\nOther data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.\nAnd so the job losses that came with the Internet\nand all that content theft,\nhave therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.\nAnd this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics\nthat copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.\nAnd some people think that string theory is tough."
p4950
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4951
aS"\nNow this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.\nIt's the precise amount of harm\nthat comes to media companies\nwhenever a single copyrighted song or movie\ngets pirated.\nHollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically\nback when they last sat down to improve copyright damages\nand made this law.\nSome people think this number's a little bit large,\nbut copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts\nare merely surprised\nthat it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year."
p4952
aS"\nNow when this law first passed,\nthe world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.\nAnd it was a big Christmas hit.\nBecause what little hoodlum wouldn't want\na million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket."
p4953
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4954
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4955
aS'\nThese days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,\nwhich is to say eight billion dollars-worth\nof stolen media.\n(Applause)\nOr about 75,000 jobs.'

p4957

p4958
aS"\nNow you might find copyright math strange,\nbut that's because it's a field\nthat's best left to experts.\nSo that's it for now.\nI hope you'll join me next time\nwhen I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry\ninto the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy."

S'\nI was born in Den Bosch,\nwhere the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after.\nAnd so I\'ve always been very fond of this painter\nwho lived and worked in the 15th century.\nAnd what is interesting about him in relation to morality\nis that he lived at a time where religion\'s influence was waning,\nand he was sort of wondering, I think,\nwhat would happen with society\nif there was no religion or if there was less religion.\nAnd so he painted this famous painting, "The Garden of Earthly Delights,"\nwhich some have interpreted\nas being humanity before the Fall,\nor being humanity without any Fall at all.\nAnd so it makes you wonder,\nwhat would happen if we hadn\'t tasted the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,\nand what kind of morality would we have?'
p4965
aS"\nMuch later, as a student,\nI went to a very different garden,\na zoological garden in Arnhem\nwhere we keep chimpanzees.\nThis is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I discovered there\nthat the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it.\nAnd at that time the focus in a lot of animal research\nwas on aggression and competition.\nI painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom,\nand humanity included,\nwas that deep down we are competitors,\nwe are aggressive,\nwe're all out for our own profit basically.\nThis is the launch of my book.\nI'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it,\nbut they surely seemed interested in the book."
p4966
aS'\nNow in the process\nof doing all this work on power and dominance\nand aggression and so on,\nI discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.\nAnd so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.\nThey ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.\nAnd about a second after I took the picture, they came together in the fork of the tree\nand they kissed and embraced each other.'
p4967
aS"\nNow this is very interesting\nbecause at the time everything was about competition and aggression,\nand so it wouldn't make any sense.\nThe only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose.\nBut why would you reconcile after a fight?\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nThis is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.\nAnd so they also reconcile with sex.\nBut the principle is exactly the same.\nThe principle is that you have\na valuable relationship\nthat is damaged by conflict,\nso you need to do something about it.\nSo my whole picture of the animal kingdom,\nand including humans also,\nstarted to change at that time."
p4968
aS"\nSo we have this image\nin political science, economics, the humanities,\nphilosophy for that matter,\nthat man is a wolf to man.\nAnd so deep down our nature's actually nasty.\nI think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.\nThe wolf is, after all,\na very cooperative animal.\nAnd that's why many of you have a dog at home,\nwhich has all these characteristics also.\nAnd it's really unfair to humanity,\nbecause humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic\nthan given credit for.\nSo I started getting interested in those issues\nand studying that in other animals."
p4969
aS'\nSo these are the pillars of morality.\nIf you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"\nthese are the two factors that always come out.\nOne is reciprocity,\nand associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.\nAnd the other one is empathy and compassion.\nAnd human morality is more than this,\nbut if you would remove these two pillars,\nthere would be not much remaining I think.\nAnd so they\'re absolutely essential.'
p4970
aS"\nSo let me give you a few examples here.\nThis is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center\nwhere they train chimpanzees to cooperate.\nSo this is already about a hundred years ago\nthat we were doing experiments on cooperation.\nWhat you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box,\nand the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.\nAnd of course, there's food on the box.\nOtherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.\nAnd so they're bringing in the box.\nAnd you can see that they're synchronized.\nYou can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.\nIt's already a big advance over many other animals\nwho wouldn't be able to do that.\nAnd now you're going to get a more interesting picture,\nbecause now one of the two chimps has been fed.\nSo one of the two is not really interested\nin the task anymore.\n(Laughter)\n(Laughter)\n(Laughter)\nNow look at what happens at the very end of this.\n(Laughter)\nHe takes basically everything."
p4971
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4972
aS"\nSo there are two interesting parts about this.\nOne is that the chimp on the right\nhas a full understanding he needs the partner --\nso a full understanding of the need for cooperation.\nThe second one is that the partner is willing to work\neven though he's not interested in the food.\nWhy would that be? Well that probably has to do with reciprocity.\nThere's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals\nthat they return favors.\nSo he will get a return favor\nat some point in the future.\nAnd so that's how this all operates."
p4973
aS"\nWe do the same task with elephants.\nNow with elephants, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.\nAnother problem with elephants\nis that you cannot make an apparatus\nthat is too heavy for a single elephant.\nNow you can probably make it,\nbut it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think.\nAnd so what we did in that case --\nwe do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik --\nis we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.\nAnd if you pull on this side of the rope,\nthe rope disappears on the other side.\nSo two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull.\nOtherwise nothing is going to happen\nand the rope disappears."
p4974
aS"\nAnd the first tape you're going to see\nis two elephants who are released together\narrive at the apparatus.\nThe apparatus is on the left with food on it.\nAnd so they come together, they arrive together,\nthey pick it up together and they pull together.\nSo it's actually fairly simple for them.\nThere they are.\nAnd so that's how they bring it in.\nBut now we're going to make it more difficult.\nBecause the whole purpose of this experiment\nis to see how well they understand cooperation.\nDo they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?"
p4975
aS"\nAnd so what we do in the next step\nis we release one elephant before the other,\nand that elephant needs to be smart enough\nto stay there and wait and not pull at the rope --\nbecause if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.\nNow this elephant does something illegal\nthat we did not teach it.\nBut it shows the understanding that he has,\nbecause he puts his big foot on the rope,\nstands on the rope and waits there for the other,\nand then the other is going to do all the work for him.\nSo it's what we call freeloading.\n(Laughter)\nBut it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.\nThey develop several of these alternative techniques\nthat we did not approve of necessarily.\nSo the other elephant is now coming\nand is going to pull it in.\nNow look at the other. The other doesn't forget to eat, of course.\n(Laughter)\nThis was the cooperation, reciprocity part."
p4976
aS'\nNow something on empathy.\nEmpathy is my main topic at the moment of research.\nAnd empathy has sort of two qualities.\nOne is the understanding part of it. This is just a regular definition:\nthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.\nAnd the emotional part.\nAnd so empathy has basically two channels.'
p4977
aS"\nOne is the body channel.\nIf you talk with a sad person,\nyou're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture,\nand before you know it you feel sad.\nAnd that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy,\nwhich many animals have.\nYour average dog has that also.\nThat's actually why people keep mammals in the home\nand not turtles or snakes or something like that\nwho don't have that kind of empathy.\nAnd then there's a cognitive channel,\nwhich is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.\nAnd that's more limited.\nThere's few animals -- I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing --\nbut there are very few animals who can do that."
p4978
aS"\nSo synchronization,\nwhich is part of that whole empathy mechanism\nis a very old one in the animal kingdom.\nAnd in humans, of course, we can study that\nwith yawn contagion.\nHumans yawn when others yawn.\nAnd it's related to empathy.\nIt activates the same areas in the brain.\nAlso, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion\nare highly empathic.\nPeople who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children,\nthey don't have yawn contagion.\nSo it is connected."
p4979
aS"\nAnd we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.\nSo that's what you see on the upper-left,\nan animated head that yawns.\nAnd there's a chimpanzee watching,\nan actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen\non which we play these animations.\n(Laughter)\nSo yawn contagion\nthat you're probably all familiar with --\nand maybe you're going to start yawning soon now --\nis something that we share with other animals.\nAnd that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization\nthat underlies empathy\nand that is universal in the mammals basically."
p4980
aS"\nNow we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation.\nThis is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming,\nand a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him\nand calms him down.\nThat's consolation. It's very similar to human consolation.\nAnd consolation behavior,\nit's empathy driven.\nActually the way to study empathy in human children\nis to instruct a family member to act distressed,\nand then they see what young children do.\nAnd so it is related to empathy,\nand that's the kind of expressions we look at."
p4981
aS"\nWe also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.\nIt's on altruism and chimpanzees\nwhere the question is, do chimpanzees care\nabout the welfare of somebody else?\nAnd for decades it had been assumed\nthat only humans can do that,\nthat only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.\nNow we did a very simple experiment.\nWe do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville,\nin the field station of Yerkes.\nAnd so that's how they live.\nAnd we call them into a room and do experiments with them.\nIn this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side.\nand one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.\nOne kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses,\nthe other one feeds both of them."
p4982
aS"\nSo this is a study we did with Vicky Horner.\nAnd here you have the two color tokens.\nSo they have a whole bucket full of them.\nAnd they have to pick one of the two colors.\nYou will see how that goes.\nSo if this chimp makes the selfish choice,\nwhich is the red token in this case,\nhe needs to give it to us.\nSo we pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards,\nbut in this case only the one on the right gets food.\nThe one on the left walks away because she knows already.\nthat this is not a good test for her.\nThen the next one is the pro-social token."
p4983
aS"\nSo the one who makes the choices -- that's the interesting part here --\nfor the one who makes the choices,\nit doesn't really matter.\nSo she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.\nSo the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.\nSo it doesn't matter whatsoever.\nAnd she should actually be choosing blindly.\nBut what we find\nis that they prefer the pro-social token.\nSo this is the 50 percent line that's the random expectation.\nAnd especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more."
p4984
aS'\nAnd if the partner puts pressure on them --\nso if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them --\nthen the choices go down.\nIt\'s as if they\'re saying,\n"If you\'re not behaving, I\'m not going to be pro-social today."\nAnd this is what happens without a partner,\nwhen there\'s no partner sitting there.\nAnd so we found that the chimpanzees do care\nabout the well-being of somebody else --\nespecially, these are other members of their own group.'
p4985
aS"\nSo the final experiment that I want to mention to you\nis our fairness study.\nAnd so this became a very famous study.\nAnd there's now many more,\nbecause after we did this about 10 years ago,\nit became very well known.\nAnd we did that originally with capuchin monkeys.\nAnd I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.\nIt has now been done with dogs and with birds\nand with chimpanzees.\nBut with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys."
p4986
aS"\nSo what we did\nis we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side.\nAgain, these animals, they live in a group, they know each other.\nWe take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.\nAnd there's a very simple task\nthat they need to do.\nAnd if you give both of them cucumber for the task,\nthe two monkeys side-by-side,\nthey're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.\nSo cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion,\nbut cucumber is perfectly fine for them.\nNow if you give the partner grapes --\nthe food preferences of my capuchin monkeys\ncorrespond exactly with the prices in the supermarket --\nand so if you give them grapes -- it's a far better food --\nthen you create inequity between them.\nSo that's the experiment we did."
p4987
aS"\nRecently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task,\nthinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction,\nand that turned out to be right.\nThe one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.\nThe one on the right is the one who gets grapes.\nThe one who gets cucumber,\nnote that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.\nThe first piece she eats.\nThen she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.\nSo she gives a rock to us. That's the task.\nAnd we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.\nThe other one needs to give a rock to us.\nAnd that's what she does.\nAnd she gets a grape and she eats it.\nThe other one sees that.\nShe gives a rock to us now,\ngets, again, cucumber.\n(Laughter)\nShe tests a rock now against the wall.\nShe needs to give it to us.\nAnd she gets cucumber again.\n(Laughter)\nSo this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here."
p4988
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p4989
aS'\n(Applause)'
p4990
aS"\nLet me tell you --\nI still have two minutes left, let me tell you a funny story about this.\nThis study became very famous\nand we got a lot of comments,\nespecially anthropologists, economists,\nphilosophers.\nThey didn't like this at all.\nBecause they had decided in their minds, I believe,\nthat fairness is a very complex issue\nand that animals cannot have it.\nAnd so one philosopher even wrote us\nthat it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness\nbecause fairness was invented during the French Revolution.\n(Laughter)"
p4991
aS"\nNow another one wrote a whole chapter\nsaying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness\nif the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.\nNow the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,\nwho's been doing this with chimpanzees,\nhad a couple of combinations of chimpanzees\nwhere, indeed, the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape\nuntil the other guy also got a grape.\nSo we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.\nAnd I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile."
p4992
aS"\nSo let me summarize.\nI believe there's an evolved morality.\nI think morality is much more than what I've been talking about,\nbut it would be impossible without these ingredients\nthat we find in other primates,\nwhich are empathy and consolation,\npro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.\nAnd so we work on these particular issues\nto see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak,\nwithout necessarily God and religion involved,\nand to see how we can get to an evolved morality."

p4997
aS"\nAbout six years ago\nI decided that I would learn Arabic,\nwhich turns out to be a supremely logical language.\nTo write a word or a phrase\nor a sentence in Arabic\nis like crafting an equation,\nbecause every part is extremely precise\nand carries a lot of information.\nThat's one of the reasons\nso much of what we've come to think of\nas Western science and mathematics and engineering\nwas really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era\nby the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks."
p4998
aS'\nThis includes the little system in Arabic\ncalled al-jebra.\nAnd al-jebr roughly translates to\n"the system for reconciling disparate parts."\nAl-jebr finally came into English as algebra.\nOne example among many.'
p4999
aS'\nThe Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom\nfinally made their way to Europe --\nwhich is to say Spain --\nin the 11th and 12th centuries.\nAnd when they arrived\nthere was tremendous interest\nin translating this wisdom\ninto a European language.'
p5000
aS"\nBut there were problems.\nOne problem\nis there are some sounds in Arabic\nthat just don't make it through a European voice box\nwithout lots of practice.\nTrust me on that one.\nAlso, those very sounds\ntend not to be represented\nby the characters that are available in European languages."
p5001
aS'\nHere\'s one of the culprits.\nThis is the letter SHeen,\nand it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."\nIt\'s also the very first letter\nof the word shalan,\nwhich means "something"\njust like the the English word "something" --\nsome undefined, unknown thing.'
p5002
aS'\nNow in Arabic,\nwe can make this definite\nby adding the definite article "al."\nSo this is al-shalan --\nthe unknown thing.\nAnd this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,\nsuch as this 10th century derivation of proofs.'
p5003
aS'\nThe problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars\nwho were tasked with translating this material\nis that the letter SHeen and the word shalan\ncan\'t be rendered into Spanish\nbecause Spanish doesn\'t have that SH,\nthat "sh" sound.\nSo by convention,\nthey created a rule in which\nthey borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound,\nfrom the classical Greek\nin the form of the letter Kai.'
p5004
aS'\nLater when this material was translated\ninto a common European language,\nwhich is to say Latin,\nthey simply replaced the Greek Kai\nwith the Latin X.\nAnd once that happened,\nonce this material was in Latin,\nit formed the basis for mathematics textbooks\nfor almost 600 years.'
p5005
aS'\nBut now we have the answer to our question.\nWhy is it that X is the unknown?\nX is the unknown\nbecause you can\'t say "sh" in Spanish.\n(Laughter)\nAnd I thought that was worth sharing.'

aS'\nIn 2001,\nmy mom, who had moved to San Francisco,\ncalled me and told me that my\ngreen card petition came through,\nthat I could now move to the United States.\nI resisted it.\nI told my mom, "Mom, I\'m having fun.\nI\'m here with my friends,\nI love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."\nBut then two weeks later she called me, she said,\n"Did you know that if you move to the United States\nyou could change your name and gender marker?"\nThat was all I needed to hear.\nMy mom also told me to put two E\'s\nin the spelling of my name.\nShe also came with me when I had my surgery\nin Thailand at 19 years old.\nIt\'s interesting, in some of the\nmost rural cities in Thailand,\nthey perform some of the most prestigious,\nsafe and sophisticated surgery.\nAt that time in the United States,\nyou needed to have surgery\nbefore you could change your\nname and gender marker.\nSo in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,\nand I remember looking at\nmy California driver\'s license\nwith the name Geena\nand gender marker F.\nThat was a powerful moment.\nFor some people,\ntheir I.D. is their license to drive\nor even to get a drink,\nbut for me, that was my license to live,\nto feel dignified.\nAll of a sudden, my fears were minimized.\nI felt that I could conquer my dream\nand move to New York and be a model.'

S"\nI want you to, for a moment,\nthink about playing a game of Monopoly,\nexcept in this game, that combination\nof skill, talent and luck\nthat help earn you success in games, as in life,\nhas been rendered irrelevant,\nbecause this game's been rigged,\nand you've got the upper hand.\nYou've got more money,\nmore opportunities to move around the board,\nand more access to resources.\nAnd as you think about that experience,\nI want you to ask yourself,\nhow might that experience of being\na privileged player in a rigged game\nchange the way that you think about yourself\nand regard that other player?"
p5072
aS"\nSo we ran a study on the U.C. Berkeley campus\nto look at exactly that question.\nWe brought in more than 100 pairs\nof strangers into the lab,\nand with the flip of a coin\nrandomly assigned one of the two\nto be a rich player in a rigged game.\nThey got two times as much money.\nWhen they passed Go,\nthey collected twice the salary,\nand they got to roll both dice instead of one,\nso they got to move around the board a lot more.\n(Laughter)\nAnd over the course of 15 minutes,\nwe watched through hidden\ncameras what happened.\nAnd what I want to do today, for the first time,\nis show you a little bit of what we saw.\nYou're going to have to pardon the sound quality,\nin some cases, because again,\nthese were hidden cameras.\nSo we've provided subtitles.\nRich Player: How many 500s did you have?\nPoor Player: Just one."
p5073
aS'\nRich Player: Are you serious.\nPoor Player: Yeah.'
p5074
aS"\nRich Player: I have three. (Laughs)\nI don't know why they gave me so much."
p5075
aS'\nPaul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players\nthat something was up.\nOne person clearly has a lot more money\nthan the other person, and yet,\nas the game unfolded,\nwe saw very notable differences\nand dramatic differences begin to emerge\nbetween the two players.\nThe rich player\nstarted to move around the board louder,\nliterally smacking the board with their piece\nas he went around.\nWe were more likely to see signs of dominance\nand nonverbal signs,\ndisplays of power\nand celebration among the rich players.'
p5076
aS"\nWe had a bowl of pretzels\npositioned off to the side.\nIt's on the bottom right corner there.\nThat allowed us to watch\nparticipants' consummatory behavior.\nSo we're just tracking how\nmany pretzels participants eat."
p5077
aS'\nRich Player: Are those pretzels a trick?'
p5078
aS"\nPoor Player: I don't know."
p5079
aS'\nPP: Okay, so no surprises, people are onto us.\nThey wonder what that bowl of pretzels\nis doing there in the first place.\nOne even asks, like you just saw,\nis that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?\nAnd yet, despite that, the power of the situation\nseems to inevitably dominate,\nand those rich players start to eat more pretzels.'
p5080
aS'\nRich Player: I love pretzels.'
p5081
aS'\n(Laughter)'
p5082
aS"\nPP: And as the game went on,\none of the really interesting and dramatic patterns\nthat we observed begin to emerge\nwas that the rich players actually\nstarted to become ruder toward the other person,\nless and less sensitive to the plight\nof those poor, poor players,\nand more and more demonstrative\nof their material success,\nmore likely to showcase how well they're doing.\nRich Player: I have money for everything.\nPoor Player: How much is that?\nRich Player: You owe me 24 dollars.\nYou're going to lose all your money soon.\nI'll buy it. I have so much money.\nI have so much money, it takes me forever.\nRich Player 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.\nRich Player 3: You're going\nto run out of money soon.\nI'm pretty much untouchable at this point."
p5083
aS"\nPP: Okay, and here's what I think\nwas really, really interesting,\nis that at the end of the 15 minutes,\nwe asked the players to talk about\ntheir experience during the game.\nAnd when the rich players talked about\nwhy they had inevitably won\nin this rigged game of Monopoly --\n(Laughter) \nthey talked about what they'd done\nto buy those different properties\nand earn their success in the game,\nand they became far less attuned\nto all those different features of the situation,\nincluding that flip of a coin\nthat had randomly gotten them into\nthat privileged position in the first place.\nAnd that's a really, really incredible insight\ninto how the mind makes sense of advantage."
p5084
aS"\nNow this game of Monopoly can be used\nas a metaphor for understanding society\nand its hierarchical structure, wherein some people\nhave a lot of wealth and a lot of status,\nand a lot of people don't.\nThey have a lot less wealth and a lot less status\nand a lot less access to valued resources.\nAnd what my colleagues and I for\nthe last seven years have been doing\nis studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.\nWhat we've been finding across dozens of studies\nand thousands of participants across this country\nis that as a person's levels of wealth increase,\ntheir feelings of compassion and empathy go down,\nand their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,\nand their ideology of self-interest increases.\nIn surveys, we found that it's actually\nwealthier individuals who are more likely\nto moralize greed being good,\nand that the pursuit of self-interest\nis favorable and moral.\nNow what I want to do today is talk about\nsome of the implications\nof this ideology self-interest,\ntalk about why we should\ncare about those implications,\nand end with what might be done."
p5085
aS"\nSome of the first studies that we ran in this area\nlooked at helping behavior,\nsomething social psychologists call\npro-social behavior.\nAnd we were really interested in who's more likely\nto offer help to another person,\nsomeone who's rich or someone who's poor.\nIn one of the studies, we bring in rich and poor\nmembers of the community into the lab\nand give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.\nWe told the participants\nthat they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves,\nor they could share a portion of it,\nif they wanted to, with a stranger\nwho is totally anonymous.\nThey'll never meet that stranger and\nthe stranger will never meet them.\nAnd we just monitor how much people give.\nIndividuals who made 25,000 sometimes\nunder 15,000 dollars a year,\ngave 44 percent more of their money\nto the stranger\nthan did individuals making 150,000\nor 200,000 dollars a year."
p5086
aS"\nWe've had people play games\nto see who's more or less likely to cheat\nto increase their chances of winning a prize.\nIn one of the games, we actually rigged a computer\nso that die rolls over a certain score\nwere impossible.\nYou couldn't get above 12 in this game,\nand yet, the richer you were,\nthe more likely you were to cheat in this game\nto earn credits toward a $50 cash prize,\nsometimes by three to four times as much."
p5087
aS"\nWe ran another study where we looked at whether\npeople would be inclined to take candy\nfrom a jar of candy that we explicitly identified\nas being reserved for children --\n(Laughter) \nparticipating -- I'm not kidding.\nI know it sounds like I'm making a joke.\nWe explicitly told participants\nthis jar of candy's for children participating\nin a developmental lab nearby.\nThey're in studies. This is for them.\nAnd we just monitored how\nmuch candy participants took.\nParticipants who felt rich\ntook two times as much candy\nas participants who felt poor."
p5088
aS"\nWe've even studied cars,\nnot just any cars,\nbut whether drivers of different kinds of cars\nare more or less inclined to break the law.\nIn one of these studies, we looked at\nwhether drivers would stop for a pedestrian\nthat we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.\nNow in California, as you all know,\nbecause I'm sure we all do this,\nit's the law to stop for a pedestrian\nwho's waiting to cross.\nSo here's an example of how we did it.\nThat's our confederate off to the left\nposing as a pedestrian.\nHe approaches as the red truck successfully stops.\nIn typical California fashion, it's overtaken\nby the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.\n(Laughter)\nNow here's an example of a more expensive car,\na Prius, driving through,\nand a BMW doing the same.\nSo we did this for hundreds of vehicles\non several days,\njust tracking who stops and who doesn't.\nWhat we found was that as the expensiveness\nof a car increased,\nthe driver's tendencies to break the law\nincreased as well.\nNone of the cars, none of the cars\nin our least expensive car category\nbroke the law.\nClose to 50 percent of the cars\nin our most expensive vehicle category\nbroke the law.\nWe've run other studies finding that\nwealthier individuals are more\nlikely to lie in negotiations,\nto endorse unethical behavior at work\nlike stealing cash from the cash register,\ntaking bribes, lying to customers."
p5089
aS"\nNow I don't mean to suggest\nthat it's only wealthy people\nwho show these patterns of behavior.\nNot at all. In fact, I think that we all,\nin our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,\nstruggle with these competing motivations\nof when, or if, to put our own interests\nabove the interests of other people.\nAnd that's understandable because\nthe American dream is an idea\nin which we all have an equal opportunity\nto succeed and prosper,\nas long as we apply ourselves and work hard,\nand a piece of that means that sometimes,\nyou need to put your own interests\nabove the interests and well-being\nof other people around you.\nBut what we're finding is that,\nthe wealthier you are, the more likely you are\nto pursue a vision of personal success,\nof achievement and accomplishment,\nto the detriment of others around you.\nHere I've plotted for you the mean household income\nreceived by each fifth and top\nfive percent of the population\nover the last 20 years.\nIn 1993, the differences between the different\nquintiles of the population, in terms of income,\nare fairly egregious.\nIt's not difficult to discern that there are differences.\nBut over the last 20 years, that significant difference\nhas become a grand canyon of sorts\nbetween those at the top and everyone else.\nIn fact, the top 20 percent of our population\nown close to 90 percent of the\ntotal wealth in this country.\nWe're at unprecedented levels\nof economic inequality.\nWhat that means is that wealth is not only becoming\nincreasingly concentrated in the hands\nof a select group of individuals,\nbut the American dream is becoming\nincreasingly unattainable\nfor an increasing majority of us.\nAnd if it's the case, as we've been finding,\nthat the wealthier you are,\nthe more entitled you feel to that wealth,\nand the more likely you are\nto prioritize your own interests\nabove the interests of other people,\nand be willing to do things to serve that self-interest,\nwell then there's no reason to think\nthat those patterns will change.\nIn fact, there's every reason to think\nthat they'll only get worse,\nand that's what it would look like\nif things just stayed the same,\nat the same linear rate, over the next 20 years."
p5090
aS"\nNow, inequality, economic inequality,\nis something we should all be concerned about,\nand not just because of those at the bottom\nof the social hierarchy,\nbut because individuals and groups\nwith lots of economic inequality do worse,\nnot just the people at the bottom, everyone.\nThere's a lot of really compelling research\ncoming out from top labs all over the world\nshowcasing the range of things\nthat are undermined\nas economic inequality gets worse.\nSocial mobility, things we really care about,\nphysical health, social trust,\nall go down as inequality goes up.\nSimilarly, negative things\nin social collectives and societies,\nthings like obesity, and violence,\nimprisonment, and punishment,\nare exacerbated as economic inequality increases.\nAgain, these are outcomes not just experienced\nby a few, but that resound\nacross all strata of society.\nEven people at the top experience these outcomes."
p5091
aS"\nSo what do we do?\nThis cascade of self-perpetuating,\npernicious, negative effects\ncould seem like something that's spun out of control,\nand there's nothing we can do about it,\ncertainly nothing we as individuals could do.\nBut in fact, we've been finding\nin our own laboratory research\nthat small psychological interventions,\nsmall changes to people's values,\nsmall nudges in certain directions,\ncan restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.\nFor instance, reminding people\nof the benefits of cooperation,\nor the advantages of community,\ncause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian\nas poor people.\nIn one study, we had people watch a brief video,\njust 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty\nthat served as a reminder of the needs of others\nin the world around them,\nand after watching that,\nwe looked at how willing people were\nto offer up their own time to a stranger\npresented to them in the lab who was in distress.\nAfter watching this video, an hour later,\nrich people became just as generous\nof their own time to help out this other person,\na stranger, as someone who's poor,\nsuggesting that these differences are not\ninnate or categorical,\nbut are so malleable\nto slight changes in people's values,\nand little nudges of compassion\nand bumps of empathy."
p5092
aS'\nAnd beyond the walls of our lab,\nwe\'re even beginning to see \nsigns of change in society.\nBill Gates, one of our nation\'s wealthiest individuals,\nin his Harvard commencement speech,\ntalked about the problem facing society\nof inequality as being the most daunting challenge,\nand talked about what must be done to combat it,\nsaying, "Humanity\'s greatest advances\nare not in its discoveries,\nbut in how those discoveries are applied\nto reduce inequity."\nAnd there\'s the Giving Pledge,\nin which more than 100 of our nation\'s\nwealthiest individuals\nare pledging half of their fortunes to charity.\nAnd there\'s the emergence\nof dozens of grassroots movements,\nlike We are the One Percent,\nthe Resource Generation,\nor Wealth for Common Good,\nin which the most privileged\nmembers of the population,\nmembers of the one percent and elsewhere,\npeople who are wealthy,\nare using their own economic resources,\nadults and youth alike, that\'s\nwhat\'s most striking to me,\nleveraging their own privilege,\ntheir own economic resources,\nto combat inequality\nby advocating for social policies,\nchanges in social values,\nand changes in people\'s behavior,\nthat work against their own economic interests\nbut that may ultimately restore the American dream.'

S"\nI wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,\nsharing some of the problems.\nAnd Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --\nbeing honest about what was going well, what wasn't,\nand making it kind of an annual thing.\nA goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,\nbecause I think there are some very important problems\nthat don't get worked on naturally.\nThat is, the market does not drive the scientists,\nthe communicators, the thinkers, the governments\nto do the right things.\nAnd only by paying attention to these things\nand having brilliant people who care and draw other people in\ncan we make as much progress as we need to."
p5097
aS"\nSo this morning I'm going to share two of these problems\nand talk about where they stand.\nBut before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.\nAny tough problem, I think it can be solved.\nAnd part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.\nOver the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.\nAnother statistic, perhaps my favorite,\nis to look at childhood deaths.\nAs recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,\nand 20 million of those died before the age of five.\nFive years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --\nand less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.\nSo that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.\nIt's a phenomenal thing.\nEach one of those lives matters a lot."
p5098
aS"\nAnd the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes\nbut also a few key breakthroughs:\nvaccines that were used more widely.\nFor example, measles was four million of the deaths\nback as recently as 1990\nand now is under 400,000.\nSo we really can make changes.\nThe next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.\nAnd I think that's doable in well under 20 years.\nWhy? Well there's only a few diseases\nthat account for the vast majority of those deaths:\ndiarrhea, pneumonia and malaria."
p5099
aS"\nSo that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,\nwhich is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?"
p5100
aS"\nWell, what's the history of this disease?\nIt's been a severe disease for thousands of years.\nIn fact, if we look at the genetic code,\nit's the only disease we can see\nthat people who lived in Africa\nactually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.\nDeaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.\nSo it was absolutely gigantic.\nAnd the disease was all over the world.\nA terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.\nPeople didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,\nwhen a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.\nSo it was everywhere.\nAnd two tools helped bring the death rate down.\nOne was killing the mosquitos with DDT.\nThe other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.\nAnd so that's why the death rate did come down."
p5101
aS"\nNow, ironically, what happened was\nit was eliminated from all the temperate zones,\nwhich is where the rich countries are.\nSo we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.\n1945, it's still most places.\n1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.\n1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.\nAnd more recently you can see it's just around the equator."
p5102
aS"\nAnd so this leads to the paradox that\nbecause the disease is only in the poorer countries,\nit doesn't get much investment.\nFor example, there's more money put into baldness drugs\nthan are put into malaria.\nNow, baldness, it's a terrible thing.\n(Laughter)\nAnd rich men are afflicted.\nAnd so that's why that priority has been set."
p5103
aS"\nBut, malaria --\neven the million deaths a year caused by malaria\ngreatly understate its impact.\nOver 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.\nIt means that you can't get the economies in these areas going\nbecause it just holds things back so much.\nNow, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.\nI brought some here, just so you could experience this.\nWe'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.\n(Laughter)\nThere's no reason only poor people should have the experience.\n(Laughter) (Applause)\nThose mosquitos are not infected."
p5104
aS"\nSo we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.\nAnd bed nets are a great tool.\nWhat it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,\nso the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.\nAnd when you use indoor spraying with DDT\nand those nets\nyou can cut deaths by over 50 percent.\nAnd that's happened now in a number of countries.\nIt's great to see."
p5105
aS"\nBut we have to be careful because malaria --\nthe parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.\nSo every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.\nAnd so you end up with two choices.\nIf you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,\nyou do it vigorously,\nyou can actually get a local eradication.\nAnd that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.\nOr, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,\nfor a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,\nbut eventually those tools will become ineffective,\nand the death rate will soar back up again.\nAnd the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention."
p5106
aS"\nNow we're on the upswing.\nBed net funding is up.\nThere's new drug discovery going on.\nOur foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial\nthat starts in a couple months.\nAnd that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.\nSo we're going to have these new tools."
p5107
aS"\nBut that alone doesn't give us the road map.\nBecause the road map to get rid of this disease\ninvolves many things.\nIt involves communicators to keep the funding high,\nto keep the visibility high,\nto tell the success stories.\nIt involves social scientists,\nso we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,\nbut 90 percent.\nWe need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,\nto do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.\nOf course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.\nWe need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.\nAnd so as these elements come together,\nI'm quite optimistic\nthat we will be able to eradicate malaria."
p5108
aS"\nNow let me turn to a second question,\na fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.\nAnd this is: How do you make a teacher great?\nIt seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,\nand we'd understand very well.\nAnd the answer is, really, that we don't.\nLet's start with why this is important.\nWell, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.\nWe all had a wonderful education.\nThat's part of the reason we're here today,\npart of the reason we're successful.\nI can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.\nI had great teachers."
p5109
aS"\nIn fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.\nThere are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.\nSo the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.\nAnd those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,\nif you measure them against the other top 20 percent.\nAnd they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology\nand keep the U.S. at the forefront."
p5110
aS"\nNow, the strength for those top 20 percent\nis starting to fade on a relative basis,\nbut even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.\nNot only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.\nAnd if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now\nto people with a better education.\nAnd we have to change this.\nWe have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.\nWe have to change it so that the country is strong\nand stays at the forefront\nof things that are driven by advanced education,\nlike science and mathematics."
p5111
aS"\nWhen I first learned the statistics,\nI was pretty stunned at how bad things are.\nOver 30 percent of kids never finish high school.\nAnd that had been covered up for a long time\nbecause they always took the dropout rate as the number\nwho started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.\nBecause they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.\nBut most of the dropouts had taken place before that.\nThey had to raise the stated dropout rate\nas soon as that tracking was done\nto over 30 percent.\nFor minority kids, it's over 50 percent.\nAnd even if you graduate from high school,\nif you're low-income,\nyou have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.\nIf you're low-income in the United States,\nyou have a higher chance of going to jail\nthan you do of getting a four-year degree.\nAnd that doesn't seem entirely fair."
p5112
aS'\nSo, how do you make education better?'
p5113
aS"\nNow, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.\nThere's many people working on it.\nWe've worked on small schools,\nwe've funded scholarships,\nwe've done things in libraries.\nA lot of these things had a good effect.\nBut the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers\nwas the very key thing.\nAnd we hooked up with some people studying\nhow much variation is there between teachers,\nbetween, say, the top quartile -- the very best --\nand the bottom quartile.\nHow much variation is there within a school or between schools?\nAnd the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.\nA top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --\nbased on test scores --\nby over 10 percent in a single year.\nWhat does that mean?\nThat means that if the entire U.S., for two years,\nhad top quartile teachers,\nthe entire difference between us and Asia would go away.\nWithin four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away."
p5114
aS'\nSo, it\'s simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.\nAnd so you\'d say, "Wow, we should reward those people.\nWe should retain those people.\nWe should find out what they\'re doing and transfer that skill to other people."\nBut I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.'
p5115
aS"\nWhat are the characteristics of this top quartile?\nWhat do they look like?\nYou might think these must be very senior teachers.\nAnd the answer is no.\nOnce somebody has taught for three years\ntheir teaching quality does not change thereafter.\nThe variation is very, very small.\nYou might think these are people with master's degrees.\nThey've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.\nThis chart takes four different factors\nand says how much do they explain teaching quality.\nThat bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,\nis a master's degree."
p5116
aS"\nNow, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.\nOne is seniority.\nBecause your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.\nThe second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.\nBut it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.\nTeach for America: slight effect.\nFor math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.\nBut, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.\nThere are some people who are very good at this.\nAnd we've done almost nothing\nto study what that is\nand to draw it in and to replicate it,\nto raise the average capability --\nor to encourage the people with it to stay in the system."
p5117
aS'\nYou might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher\'s leave?"\nThe answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.\nAnd it\'s a system with very high turnover.'
p5118
aS'\nNow, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.\nA good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.\nKIPP means Knowledge Is Power.\nIt\'s an unbelievable thing.\nThey have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --\nand what goes on is great teaching.\nThey take the poorest kids,\nand over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.\nAnd the whole spirit and attitude in those schools\nis very different than in the normal public schools.\nThey\'re team teaching. They\'re constantly improving their teachers.\nThey\'re taking data, the test scores,\nand saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."\nThey\'re deeply engaged in making teaching better.'
p5119
aS'\nWhen you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,\nat first it\'s very bizarre.\nI sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"\nThe teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.\nI thought, "I\'m in the sports rally or something.\nWhat\'s going on?"\nAnd the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren\'t paying attention,\nwhich kids were bored,\nand calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.\nIt was a very dynamic environment,\nbecause particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --\nkeeping people engaged and setting the tone\nthat everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,\nnobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn\'t want to be there.\nEverybody needs to be involved.\nAnd so KIPP is doing it.'
p5120
aS'\nHow does that compare to a normal school?\nWell, in a normal school, teachers aren\'t told how good they are.\nThe data isn\'t gathered.\nIn the teacher\'s contract,\nit will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --\nsometimes to once per year.\nAnd they need advanced notice to do that.\nSo imagine running a factory where you\'ve got these workers,\nsome of them just making crap\nand the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,\nbut you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,\nand try and do a good job in that one brief moment."'
p5121
aS"\nEven a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.\nThey don't have the test scores,\nand there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.\nFor example, New York passed a law\nthat said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used\nin the tenure decision for the teachers.\nAnd so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.\nBut I'm optimistic about this,\nI think there are some clear things we can do."
p5122
aS'\nFirst of all, there\'s a lot more testing going on,\nand that\'s given us the picture of where we are.\nAnd that allows us to understand who\'s doing it well,\nand call them out, and find out what those techniques are.\nOf course, digital video is cheap now.\nPutting a few cameras in the classroom\nand saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis\nis very practical in all public schools.\nAnd so every few weeks teachers could sit down\nand say, "OK, here\'s a little clip of something I thought I did well.\nHere\'s a little clip of something I think I did poorly.\nAdvise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"\nAnd they could all sit and work together on those problems.\nYou can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,\nhave it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.'
p5123
aS"\nYou can take those great courses and make them available\nso that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.\nIf you have a kid who's behind,\nyou would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.\nAnd in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,\nbut you could make it so that DVDs were always available,\nand so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.\nAnd so by thinking of this as a personnel system,\nwe can do it much better."
p5124
aS'\nNow there\'s a book actually, about KIPP --\nthe place that this is going on --\nthat Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."\nAnd I thought it was so fantastic.\nIt gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.\nI\'m going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.\n(Applause)'
p5125
aS"\nNow, we put a lot of money into education,\nand I really think that education is the most important thing to get right\nfor the country to have as strong a future as it should have.\nIn fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --\nthe House version actually had money in it for these data systems,\nand it was taken out in the Senate\nbecause there are people who are threatened by these things."
p5126
aS"\nBut I -- I'm optimistic.\nI think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,\nand it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.\nI only had time to frame those two problems.\nThere's a lot more problems like that --\nAIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,\njust at the very name of these things.\nAnd the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.\nYou know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.\nGovernments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.\nThe private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things."
p5127
aS"\nSo it's going to take brilliant people like you\nto study these things, get other people involved --\nand you're helping to come up with solutions.\nAnd with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it."
p5128
aS'\nThank you.\n(Applause)'
p5129
aa(lp5130
S"\nImagine, if you will -- a gift.\nI'd like for you to picture it in your mind.\nIt's not too big --\nabout the size of a golf ball.\nSo envision what it looks like all wrapped up.\nBut before I show you what's inside,\nI will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.\nIt will bring all of your family together.\nYou will feel loved and appreciated like never before\nand reconnect with friends and acquaintances\nyou haven't heard from in years.\nAdoration and admiration\nwill overwhelm you.\nIt will recalibrate what's most important in your life."
p5131
aS'\nIt will redefine your sense\nof spirituality and faith.\nYou\'ll have a new understanding\nand trust in your body.\nYou\'ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.\nYou\'ll expand your vocabulary,\nmeet new people,\nand you\'ll have a healthier lifestyle.\nAnd get this --\nyou\'ll have an eight-week vacation\nof doing absolutely nothing.\nYou\'ll eat countless gourmet meals.\nFlowers will arrive by the truckload.\nPeople will say to you,\n"You look great.

aS"\nYou'll be challenged, inspired,\nmotivated and humbled.\nYour life will have new meaning.\nPeace, health,\nserenity, happiness,\nnirvana.\nThe price?\n$55,000,\nand that's an incredible deal."
p5133
aS"\nBy now I know you're dying to know\nwhat it is and where you can get one.\nDoes Amazon carry it?\nDoes it have the Apple logo on it?\nIs there a waiting list?\nNot likely.\nThis gift came to me about five months ago.\nIt looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --\nnot quite so pretty.\nAnd this,\nand then this.\nIt was a rare gem --\na brain tumor,\nhemangioblastoma --\nthe gift that keeps on giving."
p5134
aS"\nAnd while I'm okay now,\nI wouldn't wish this gift for you.\nI'm not sure you'd want it.\nBut I wouldn't change my experience.\nIt profoundly altered my life\nin ways I didn't expect\nin all the ways I just shared with you."
p5135
aS"\nSo the next time you're faced\nwith something that's unexpected,\nunwanted and uncertain,\nconsider\nthat it just may be a gift."
p5136
aS'\n(Applause)'
p5137
aa(lp5138
S"\nIn the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.\nAnd it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,\nand it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.\nAnd in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,\nbut we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --\nand we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,\nand, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,\nthe body formerly known as a planet.\nAnd all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:\na voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,\nto understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,\nand we, living on it, came to be."
p5139
aS"\nAnd of all the places in the solar system that we might go to\nand search for answers to questions like this,\nthere's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --\nwe visited Saturn in the early 1980s --\nbut our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail\nsince the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space\nfor seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,\nand became at that point the farthest robotic outpost\nthat humanity had ever established around the Sun."
p5140
aS"\nNow, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.\nIt offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,\nand the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.\nIn fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot\nabout the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.\nAnd here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,\nwhich is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.\nAnd then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,\ntaken by the Hubble Space Telescope."
p5141
aS"\nSo the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor\nfor a much larger human voyage\nto understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,\nand also how humans fit into that picture.\nAnd it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.\nI can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken\nin the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.\nSo I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories\nthat have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition\nthat we are conducting around Saturn,\nand have been for the past two and a half years."
p5142
aS"\nSaturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.\nThey range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.\nMost of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,\nshow Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,\nand then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,\nshowing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.\nNow, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts."
p5143
aS"\nAnd those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,\nand, until Cassini had arrived there,\nwas the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain\nthat we had remaining in our solar system.\nAnd it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.\nIt has a very large, thick atmosphere,\nand in fact, its surface environment was believed to be\nmore like the environment we have here on the Earth,\nor at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.\nIts atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,\nexcept that its atmosphere is suffused with\nsimple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.\nAnd these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan\nget broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.\nThis haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.\nAnd that's why you cannot see down to the surface\nwith our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum."
p5144
aS"\nBut these haze particles, it was surmised,\nbefore we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,\ngently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface\nin a thick organic sludge.\nSo like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.\nBut this is what we suspected. And these molecules,\nespecially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.\nAnd so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.\nIt's a condensable in the atmosphere,\nand so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore\na whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,\nand above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,\nwhich prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.\nThe temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit."
p5145
aS"\nBut despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.\nAnd doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers\nand cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.\nIt can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,\ndown into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.\nTry to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.\nIt's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.\nIt's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,\nit might be raining, and you might be standing\non the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)"
p5146
aS"\nThat is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,\nand I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,\nis every bit as fascinating as that story is.\nAnd for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --\nit has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.\nAs I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.\nThis is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.\nAnd yet another moon there --\nI don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.\nWe have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface\nthrough this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.\nAnd we have taken pictures like this.\nAnd what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.\nIt was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.\nWhen you look closer at this region, you start to see things\nlike sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.\nThis, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,\nbut there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,\nmeaning it's a very young surface.\nAnd there are features that look tectonic.\nThey look like they've been pulled apart.\nWhenever you see anything linear on a planet,\nit means there's been a fracture, like a fault.\nAnd so it's been tectonically altered."
p5147
aS"\nBut we couldn't make sense of our images,\nuntil, six months after we got into orbit,\nan event occurred that many have regarded\nas the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.\nAnd that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,\nthe European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried\nfor seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,\nit took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.\nAnd I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.\nThis is a device of human making,\nand it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.\nIt is so significant that, in my mind,\nthis was an event that should have been celebrated\nwith ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,\nand sadly, that wasn't the case.\n(Laughter)."
p5148
aS'\nIt was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,\nand this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,\nand the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,\nand American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.\nIt was a moving demonstration of what the words\n"united nations" are supposed to mean:\na true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.\nAnd, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,\nand to come to understand a planetary system\nthat, for all of human history, had been unreachable,\nand now humans had actually touched it.\nSo it was -- I mean, I\'m getting goose bumps just talking about it.\nIt was a tremendously emotional event,\nand it\'s something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn\'t either.\n(Applause).'
p5149
aS"\nBut anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,\nand it also took panoramic pictures.\nAnd I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures\nof Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.\nAnd it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted\nthose other pictures taken from orbit to be.\nIt was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.\nIt's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.\nAnd you can follow these channels\nand you can see how they all converge.\nAnd they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.\nYou are looking at a shoreline.\nWas this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.\nBut this is somewhat of a shoreline."
p5150
aS'\nThis picture is taken at 16 kilometers.\nThis is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.\nOkay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.\nIf you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,\nyou would be flying at these altitudes.\nSo, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines\nas you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)'
p5151
aS"\nAnd then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,\nand I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,\nthe first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.\nAnd here is the horizon, OK?\nThese are probably water ice pebbles, yes?\n(Applause).\nAnd obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions\nand it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.\nWhat the probe came down in was basically\nthe Titan equivalent of a mud flat.\nThis is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.\nAnd it's probably the case that this material\nhas washed off the highlands of Titan\nthrough these channels that we saw,\nand has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.\nAnd that is what the Huygens probe landed in."
p5152
aS"\nBut still, there was no sign in our images,\nor even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.\nWhere were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.\nOK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,\nshowing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,\nseparated by a few kilometers,\nand they go on for miles and miles and miles.\nThere's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.\nThis is the Saharan desert of Titan.\nIt's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes."
p5153
aS"\nSo again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,\nuntil finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.\nAnd there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.\nIt's about the size of Lake Ontario.\nAnd then, only a week and a half ago,\nwe flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,\nwe found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.\nSo it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,\nor during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.\nAnd I think you would agree that we have found Titan\nis a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,\nand having Earth-like geological formations\nand a tremendous geographical diversity,\nand is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system\nfor complexity and richness is the Earth itself."
p5154
aS"\nAnd so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,\nit's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,\njust to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.\n(Laughter).\nAnd Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,\nand its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.\nIt is a very geologically active body.\nBut the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus\nwas found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --\nwhere we found this system of fractures.\nAnd they're a different color because they're a different composition.\nThey are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.\nMoreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,\nhas elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.\nThat's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics."
p5155
aS'\nAnd then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered\nthat from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles\nextending hundreds of miles into space.\nAnd when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,\nwe see that these jets feed a plume\nthat, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles\ninto the space above Enceladus.\nMy team and I have examined images like this,\nand like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.\nAnd we have arrived at the conclusion\nthat these jets may be erupting from pockets\nof liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.'
p5156
aS"\nSo we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.\nIn other words, we have possibly stumbled upon\nthe holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,\nor in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.\nAnd I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life\nelsewhere in our solar system,\nwhether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,\nwould have enormous cultural and scientific implications.\nBecause if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred\nnot once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,\nthen that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times\nthroughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history."
p5157
aS"\nRight now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.\nIt is precious, it is unique,\nit is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.\nAnd if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --\nand we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --\nyou would remember this very famous picture\ntaken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.\nIt was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,\nand it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,\nand our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet."
p5158
aS"\nWell, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,\na picture that no human eye has ever seen before.\nIt is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.\nAnd in this impossibly beautiful picture,\nyou see the main rings backlit by the Sun,\nyou see the refracted image of the Sun\nand you see this ring created, in fact,\nby the exhalations of Enceladus.\nBut as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,\nsight of our own planet,\ncradled in the arms of Saturn's rings."
p5159
aS'\nNow, there is something deeply moving\nabout seeing ourselves from afar,\nand capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet\nin the skies of other worlds.\nAnd that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,\nmay be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn\nfrom this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.\nAnd thank you very much.\n(Applause)'

S'\nToday I\'m going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.\nAnd the problem I\'m going to talk about\nis not the familiar one from philosophy,\nwhich is, "How can we know\nwhether other people have minds?"\nThat is, maybe you have a mind,\nand everyone else is just a really convincing robot.\nSo that\'s a problem in philosophy,\nbut for today\'s purposes I\'m going to assume\nthat many people in this audience have a mind,\nand that I don\'t have to worry about this.'
p5162
aS'\nThere is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us\nas parents and teachers and spouses\nand novelists,\nwhich is, "Why is it so hard\nto know what somebody else wants or believes?"\nOr perhaps, more relevantly,\n"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"'
p5163
aS'\nI think novelists put this best.\nLike Philip Roth, who said,\n"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business\nof other people?\nSo ill equipped are we all,\nto envision one another\'s interior workings\nand invisible aims."\nSo as a teacher and as a spouse,\nthis is, of course, a problem I confront every day.\nBut as a scientist, I\'m interested in a different problem of other minds,\nand that is the one I\'m going to introduce to you today.\nAnd that problem is, "How is it so easy\nto know other minds?"'
p5164
aS'\nSo to start with an illustration,\nyou need almost no information,\none snapshot of a stranger,\nto guess what this woman is thinking,\nor what this man is.\nAnd put another way, the crux of the problem is\nthe machine that we use for thinking about other minds,\nour brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,\nthat we share with all other animals, with monkeys\nand mice and even sea slugs.\nAnd yet, you put them together in a particular network,\nand what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.\nOr to say, as Alan Greenspan did,\n"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,\nbut I\'m not sure you realize that what you heard\nis not what I meant."\n(Laughter)'
p5165
aS"\nSo, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience\nis to stand with these ideas,\none in each hand.\nAnd to try to understand how you can put together\nsimple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,\nand get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.\nSo I'm going to tell you three things about this today.\nObviously the whole project here is huge.\nAnd I'm going to tell you just our first few steps\nabout the discovery of a special brain region\nfor thinking about other people's thoughts.\nSome observations on the slow development of this system\nas we learn how to do this difficult job.\nAnd then finally, to show that some of the differences\nbetween people, in how we judge others,\ncan be explained by differences in this brain system."
p5166
aS"\nSo first, the first thing I want to tell you is that\nthere is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,\nwhose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.\nThis is a picture of it.\nIt's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.\nIt's above and behind your right ear.\nAnd this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,\nor when you read Romeo and Juliet\nor when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.\nAnd you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.\nSo this brain region is called the Right TPJ.\nAnd this picture shows the average activation\nin a group of what we call typical human adults.\nThey're MIT undergraduates.\n(Laughter)"
p5167
aS"\nThe second thing I want to say about this brain system\nis that although we human adults\nare really good at understanding other minds,\nwe weren't always that way.\nIt takes children a long time to break into the system.\nI'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.\nThe first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,\nas kids learn to understand\nthat somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.\nSo I'm going to show you a five-year-old\nwho is getting a standard kind of puzzle\nthat we call the false belief task."
p5168
aS'\nRebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.\nAnd you know what pirates really like?'
p5169
aS'\nChild: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.'
p5170
aS'\nChild: Cheese? I love cheese!'
p5171
aS'\nRS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,\nand he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!\nI really love cheese sandwiches."\nAnd Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.\nAnd Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."\nAnd so Ivan goes to get a drink.\nAnd while Ivan is away\nthe wind comes,\nand it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.\nAnd now, here comes the other pirate.\nThis pirate is called Joshua.\nAnd Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.\nSo Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,\n"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."\nAnd he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.'
p5172
aS'\nChild: So, that one is his.'
p5173
aS"\nRS: That one is Joshua's. That's right."
p5174
aS'\nChild: And then his went on the ground.'
p5175
aS"\nRS: That's exactly right."
p5176
aS"\nChild: So he won't know which one is his."
p5177
aS'\nRS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.\nIvan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."\nSo which one do you think Ivan is going to take?'
p5178
aS'\nChild: I think he is going to take that one.'
p5179
aS"\nRS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.\nOh yeah, you were right. He took that one."
p5180
aS"\nSo that's a five-year-old who clearly understands\nthat other people can have false beliefs\nand what the consequences are for their actions.\nNow I'm going to show you a three-year-old\nwho got the same puzzle."
p5181
aS'\nRS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."\nWhich sandwich is he going to take?\nDo you think he\'s going to take that one? Let\'s see what happens.\nLet\'s see what he does. Here comes Ivan.\nAnd he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."\nAnd he takes this one.\nUh-oh. Why did he take that one?'
p5182
aS'\nChild: His was on the grass.'
p5183
aS"\nSo the three-year-old does two things differently.\nFirst, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich\nthat's really his.\nAnd second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,\nwhere we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,\nthe three-year-old comes up with another explanation:\nHe's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,\nbecause now it's dirty, on the ground.\nSo that's why he's taking the other sandwich.\nNow of course, development doesn't end at five.\nAnd we can see the continuation of this process\nof learning to think about other people's thoughts\nby upping the ante\nand asking children now, not for an action prediction,\nbut for a moral judgment.\nSo first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again."
p5184
aS"\nRS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?"
p5185
aS'\nChild: Yeah.'
p5186
aS"\nRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?"
p5187
aS'\nChild: Yeah.'
p5188
aS"\nSo it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan\nto take Joshua's sandwich,\nsince he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich\nto avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.\nBut now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.\nRemember the five-year-old completely understood\nwhy Ivan took Joshua's sandwich."
p5189
aS"\nRS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty\nfor taking Joshua's sandwich?"
p5190
aS'\nChild: Um, yeah.'
p5191
aS'\nAnd so, it is not until age seven\nthat we get what looks more like an adult response.'
p5192
aS"\nRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?"
p5193
aS'\nChild: No, because the wind should get in trouble.'
p5194
aS'\nHe says the wind should get in trouble\nfor switching the sandwiches.\n(Laughter)'
p5195
aS"\nAnd now what we've started to do in my lab\nis to put children into the brain scanner\nand ask what's going on in their brain\nas they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.\nSo the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,\nbeing used while children are thinking about other people.\nBut it's not quite like the adult brain."
p5196
aS"\nSo whereas in the adults, as I told you,\nthis brain region is almost completely specialized --\nit does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --\nin children it's much less so,\nwhen they are age five to eight,\nthe age range of the children I just showed you.\nAnd actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,\ngetting into early adolescence,\nthey still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.\nAnd so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood\nand even into adolescence,\nboth the cognitive system,\nour mind's ability to think about other minds,\nand the brain system that supports it\nare continuing, slowly, to develop."
p5197
aS"\nBut of course, as you're probably aware,\neven in adulthood,\npeople differ from one another in how good they are\nat thinking of other minds, how often they do it\nand how accurately.\nAnd so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults\nin how they think about other people's thoughts\nbe explained in terms of differences in this brain region?\nSo, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version\nof the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.\nAnd I'm going to give that to you now."
p5198
aS'\nSo Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,\nand they take a break for coffee.\nAnd Grace\'s friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.\nGrace goes to make the coffee\nand finds by the coffee a pot\ncontaining a white powder, which is sugar.\nBut the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"\nso Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.\nAnd she puts it in her friend\'s coffee.\nAnd her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.'
p5199
aS'\nHow many people think it was morally permissible\nfor Grace to put the powder in the coffee?\nOkay. Good. (Laughter)\nSo we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed\nin this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?'
p5200
aS"\nAnd we can compare that to another case,\nwhere everything in the real world is the same.\nThe powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.\nNow she thinks the powder is sugar.\nAnd perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar\nand puts it in her friend's coffee,\npeople say she deserves no blame at all.\nWhereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,\nnow people say she deserves a lot of blame,\neven though what happened in the real world was exactly the same."
p5201
aS'\nAnd in fact, they say she deserves more blame\nin this case, the failed attempt to harm,\nthan in another case,\nwhich we call an accident.\nWhere Grace thought the powder was sugar,\nbecause it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,\nbut actually the powder was poison.\nSo even though when the powder was poison,\nthe friend drank the coffee and died,\npeople say Grace deserves less blame in that case,\nwhen she innocently thought it was sugar,\nthan in the other case, where she thought it was poison\nand no harm occurred.'
p5202
aS"\nPeople, though, disagree a little bit\nabout exactly how much blame Grace should get\nin the accident case.\nSome people think she should deserve more blame,\nand other people less.\nAnd what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside\nthe brains of people while they're making that judgment.\nSo what I'm showing you, from left to right,\nis how much activity there was in this brain region,\nand from top to bottom, how much blame\npeople said that Grace deserved."
p5203
aS'\nAnd what you can see is, on the left\nwhen there was very little activity in this brain region,\npeople paid little attention to her innocent belief\nand said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.\nWhereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,\npeople paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,\nand said she deserved a lot less blame\nfor causing the accident.'
p5204
aS"\nSo that's good, but of course\nwhat we'd rather is have a way to interfere\nwith function in this brain region,\nand see if we could change people's moral judgment.\nAnd we do have such a tool.\nIt's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,\nor TMS.\nThis is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse\nthrough somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,\nand temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region."
p5205
aS"\nSo I'm going to show you a demo of this.\nFirst, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.\nI'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.\nWhen you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.\nSo now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,\nto the part of my brain that controls my hand.\nSo there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse."
p5206
aS'\nWoman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.'
p5207
aS"\nOkay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand\nby putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.\nAnd we can use that same pulse,\nnow applied to the RTPJ,\nto ask if we can change people's moral judgments.\nSo these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.\nAnd then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ\nand ask how people's judgments change.\nAnd the first thing is, people can still do this task overall."
p5208
aS'\nSo their judgments of the case when everything was fine\nremain the same. They say she deserves no blame.\nBut in the case of a failed attempt to harm,\nwhere Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,\npeople now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame\nfor putting the powder in the coffee.'
p5209
aS"\nAnd in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,\nbut it was really poison and so she caused a death,\npeople say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.\nSo what I've told you today is that\npeople come, actually, especially well equipped\nto think about other people's thoughts."
p5210
aS'\nWe have a special brain system\nthat lets us think about what other people are thinking.\nThis system takes a long time to develop,\nslowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.\nAnd even in adulthood, differences in this brain region\ncan explain differences among adults\nin how we think about and judge other people.'
p5211
aS'\nBut I want to give the last word back to the novelists,\nand to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,\n"The fact remains that getting people right\nis not what living is all about anyway.\nIt\'s getting them wrong that is living.\nGetting them wrong and wrong and wrong,\nand then on careful reconsideration,\ngetting them wrong again."\nThank you.\n(Applause)'
p5212
aS"\nChris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using\nmagnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,\nthat sounds alarming.\n(Laughter)\nPlease tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say."
p5213
aS"\nRS: I'm not.\nI mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.\n(Laughter)"
p5214
aS"\nCA: They really are calling?\nSo then seriously,\nyou must lie awake at night sometimes\nwondering where this work leads.\nI mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,\nbut someone could take this knowledge\nand in some future\nnot-torture chamber,\ndo acts that people here might be worried about."
p5215
aS"\nRS: Yeah, we worry about this.\nSo, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.\nOne is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.\nSo it's not a surreptitious technology.\nIt's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.\nThe changes I showed you are impressive to me\nbecause of what they tell us about the function of the brain,\nbut they're small on the scale\nof the moral judgments that we actually make."
p5216
aS"\nAnd what we changed was not people's\nmoral judgments when they're deciding what to do,\nwhen they're making action choices.\nWe changed their ability to judge other people's actions.\nAnd so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as\nstudying the defendant in a criminal trial,\nbut studying the jury."
p5217
aS'\nCA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations\nin education, to perhaps bring up\na generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?'
p5218
aS"\nRS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.\nThe whole research program here of studying\nthe distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.\nUntil recently, what we knew about the brain\nwere the things that any other animal's brain could do too,\nso we could study it in animal models.\nWe knew how brains see, and how they control the body\nand how they hear and sense.\nAnd the whole project of understanding\nhow brains do the uniquely human things --\nlearn language and abstract concepts,\nand thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.\nAnd we don't know yet what the implications will be\nof understanding it."
p5219
aS"\nCA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called\nthe hard problem of consciousness,\nthat puzzles a lot of people.\nThe notion that you can understand\nwhy a brain works, perhaps.\nBut why does anyone have to feel anything?\nWhy does it seem to require these beings who sense things\nfor us to operate?\nYou're a brilliant young neuroscientist.\nI mean, what chances do you think there are\nthat at some time in your career,\nsomeone, you or someone else,\nis going to come up with some paradigm shift\nin understanding what seems an impossible problem?"
p5220
aS"\nRS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't."
p5221
aS'\nCA: Why?'
p5222
aS"\nRS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.\n(Laughter)"
p5223
aS"\nCA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.\n(Applause)"
p5224
aa(lp5225
S'\nIn his inaugural address,\nBarack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best\nas we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.\nBut what did he appeal to?\nHe did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,\nand tell us to just go shopping.\nNor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.\nInvest, invest, invest."\nInstead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.\nAnd he appealed to virtue.\nVirtue is an old-fashioned word.\nIt seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.\nAnd besides, some of you might be wondering,\nwhat the hell does it mean?'
p5226
aS"\nLet me begin with an example.\nThis is the job description of a hospital janitor\nthat is scrolling up on the screen.\nAnd all of the items on it are unremarkable.\nThey're the things you would expect:\nmop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.\nIt may be a little surprising how many things there are,\nbut it's not surprising what they are.\nBut the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:\neven though this is a very long list,\nthere isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.\nNot one.\nThe janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital."
p5227
aS"\nAnd yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors\nto get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,\nthey encountered Mike,\nwho told them about how he stopped mopping the floor\nbecause Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,\ntrying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.\nAnd Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition\nand didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge\nbecause there were some family members who were there all day, every day\nwho, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.\nAnd then there was Luke,\nwho washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice\nbecause the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,\ndidn't see Luke do it the first time,\nand his father was angry.\nAnd behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses\nand, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,\ndoesn't just make people feel a little better,\nit actually improves the quality of patient care\nand enables hospitals to run well."
p5228
aS'\nNow, not all janitors are like this, of course.\nBut the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions\ninvolving kindness, care and empathy\nare an essential part of the job.\nAnd yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.\nThese janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.\nAnd beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.'
p5229
aS'\n"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,\n"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."\nA wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,\nas the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.\nA wise person knows how to improvise,\nas Luke did when he re-washed the floor.\nReal-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined\nand the context is always changing.\nA wise person is like a jazz musician --\nusing the notes on the page, but dancing around them,\ninventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.\nA wise person knows how to use these moral skills\nin the service of the right aims.\nTo serve other people, not to manipulate other people.\nAnd finally, perhaps most important,\na wise person is made, not born.\nWisdom depends on experience,\nand not just any experience.\nYou need the time to get to know the people that you\'re serving.\nYou need permission to be allowed to improvise,\ntry new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.\nAnd you need to be mentored by wise teachers.'
p5230
aS"\nWhen you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described\nhow hard it is to learn to do their job,\nthey tell you that it takes lots of experience.\nAnd they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.\nIt takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.\nAt TED, brilliance is rampant.\nIt's scary.\nThe good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.\nThe bad news is that without wisdom,\nbrilliance isn't enough.\nIt's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.\n(Applause)"
p5231
aS"\nNow, I hope that we all know this.\nThere's a sense in which it's obvious,\nand yet, let me tell you a little story.\nIt's a story about lemonade.\nA dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.\nHis son asked him for some lemonade\nand Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.\nAll they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,\nwhich was five percent alcohol.\nDad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.\nSo he brought it back.\nAnd the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,\nand called the police, who called an ambulance\nthat rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.\nThe emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.\nAnd they were ready to let the kid go."
p5232
aS'\nBut not so fast.\nThe Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.\nAnd the child was sent to a foster home for three days.\nAt that point, can the child go home?\nWell, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.\nAfter two weeks, I\'m happy to report,\nthe family was reunited.\nBut the welfare workers and the ambulance people\nand the judge all said the same thing:\n"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."'
p5233
aS'\nHow do things like this happen?\nScott Simon, who told this story on NPR,\nsaid, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,\nbut they spare you from thinking."\nAnd, to be fair, rules are often imposed\nbecause previous officials have been lax\nand they let a child go back to an abusive household.\nFair enough.\nWhen things go wrong, as of course they do,\nwe reach for two tools to try to fix them.'
p5234
aS"\nOne tool we reach for is rules.\nBetter ones, more of them.\nThe second tool we reach for is incentives.\nBetter ones, more of them.\nWhat else, after all, is there?\nWe can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.\nRegulate, regulate, regulate.\nFix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...\nThe truth is that neither rules nor incentives\nare enough to do the job.\nHow could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?\nAnd would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?\nIt's preposterous on its face.\nAnd what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,\nrules and incentives may make things better in the short run,\nbut they create a downward spiral\nthat makes them worse in the long run.\nMoral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules\nthat deprives us of the opportunity\nto improvise and learn from our improvisations.\nAnd moral will is undermined\nby an incessant appeal to incentives\nthat destroy our desire to do the right thing.\nAnd without intending it,\nby appealing to rules and incentives,\nwe are engaging in a war on wisdom."
p5235
aS'\nLet me just give you a few examples,\nfirst of rules and the war on moral skill.\nThe lemonade story is one.\nSecond, no doubt more familiar to you,\nis the nature of modern American education:\nscripted, lock-step curricula.\nHere\'s an example from Chicago kindergarten.\nReading and enjoying literature\nand words that begin with \'B.\'\n"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug\nand give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.\nSay 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.\nAll over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,\nevery teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.\nWe know why these scripts are there.\nWe don\'t trust the judgment of teachers enough\nto let them loose on their own.\nScripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.\nAnd they prevent disaster.\nBut what they assure in its place is mediocrity.\n(Applause)'
p5236
aS"\nDon't get me wrong. We need rules!\nJazz musicians need some notes --\nmost of them need some notes on the page.\nWe need more rules for the bankers, God knows.\nBut too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians\nfrom improvising.\nAnd as a result, they lose their gifts,\nor worse, they stop playing altogether."
p5237
aS"\nNow, how about incentives?\nThey seem cleverer.\nIf you have one reason for doing something\nand I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,\nit seems only logical that two reasons are better than one\nand you're more likely to do it.\nRight?\nWell, not always.\nSometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another\ninstead of complimenting,\nand they make people less likely to do it."
p5238
aS'\nI\'ll just give you one example because time is racing.\nIn Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,\nthey were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.\nThere was going to be a national referendum.\nSome psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.\nAnd they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"\nAstonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.\nThey knew it was dangerous.\nThey thought it would reduce their property values.\nBut it had to go somewhere\nand they had responsibilities as citizens.\nThe psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.\nThey said, "If we paid you six weeks\' salary every year\nwould you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"\nTwo reasons. It\'s my responsibility and I\'m getting paid.\nInstead of 50 percent saying yes,\n25 percent said yes.\nWhat happens is that\nthe second this introduction of incentive gets us\nso that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"\nall we ask is, "What serves my interests?"\nWhen incentives don\'t work,\nwhen CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies\nin pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,\nthe response is always the same.\nGet smarter incentives.'
p5239
aS'\nThe truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise\nthat are ever going to be smart enough.\nAny incentive system can be subverted by bad will.\nWe need incentives. People have to make a living.\nBut excessive reliance on incentives\ndemoralizes professional activity\nin two senses of that word.\nIt causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale\nand it causes the activity itself to lose morality.'
p5240
aS'\nBarack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,\n"We must ask not just \'Is it profitable?\' but \'Is it right?\'"\nAnd when professions are demoralized,\neveryone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives\nand they stop asking "Is it right?"\nWe see this in medicine.\n("Although it\'s nothing serious, let\'s keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn\'t turn into a major lawsuit.")\nAnd we certainly see it in the world of business.\n("In order to remain competitive in today\'s marketplace, I\'m afraid we\'re going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")\n("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")\nIt is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.'
p5241
aS"\nSo what can we do?\nA few sources of hope:\nwe ought to try to re-moralize work.\nOne way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.\n(Applause)\nThere is no better way to show people that you're not serious\nthan to tie up everything you have to say about ethics\ninto a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course."

aS"\nWhat to do instead?\nOne: Celebrate moral exemplars.\nAcknowledge, when you go to law school,\nthat a little voice is whispering in your ear\nabout Atticus Finch.\nNo 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.\nPeople are inspired by moral heroes.\nBut we learn that with sophistication\ncomes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.\nWell, acknowledge them.\nBe proud that you have them.\nCelebrate them.\nAnd demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.\nThat's one thing we can do."
p5243
aS'\nI don\'t know how many of you remember this:\nanother moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,\nwho was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --\nthey made Polartec --\nThe factory burned down.\n3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.\nWhy? Because it would have been a disaster for them\nand for the community if he had let them go.\n"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,\nbut I can tell you it\'s worth more. We\'re doing fine."'
p5244
aS"\nJust at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.\nTwo were particularly inspiring to me.\nOne was Ray Anderson, who turned --\n(Applause)\n-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire\ninto a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.\nWhy? Because it was the right thing to do.\nAnd a bonus he's discovering is\nhe's actually going to make even more money.\nHis employees are inspired by the effort.\nWhy? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.\nYesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.\n(Applause)"
p5245
aS"\nIn many ways this is the perfect example.\nBecause it took the will to do the right thing.\nGod knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.\nI'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know\nin order to plot this out.\nBut most important to make it work --\nand he emphasized this --\nis that it took knowing the people in the communities.\nUnless the people you're working with are behind you,\nthis will fail.\nAnd there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,\nbecause different people in different communities\norganize their lives in different ways."
p5246
aS"\nSo there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.\nAnd you don't have to be a mega-hero.\nThere are ordinary heroes.\nOrdinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.\nAs practitioners each and every one of us should strive\nto be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.\nAs heads of organizations,\nwe should strive to create environments\nthat encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.\nEven the wisest and most well-meaning people\nwill give up if they have to swim against the current\nin the organizations in which they work."
p5247
aS'\nIf you run an organization, you should be sure\nthat none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --\nhave job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.\nBecause the truth is that\nany work that you do that involves interaction with other people\nis moral work.\nAnd any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.'
p5248
aS'\nAnd, perhaps most important,\nas teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,\nthe moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.\nAnd there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.\nOne is that we are always teaching.\nSomeone is always watching.\nThe camera is always on.\nBill Gates talked about the importance of education\nand, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:\n"Knowledge is power."\nAnd he talked about a lot of the wonderful things\nthat KIPP is doing\nto take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.'
p5249
aS"\nI want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing\nthat Bill didn't mention.\nThat is that they have come to the realization\nthat the single most important thing kids need to learn\nis character.\nThey need to learn to respect themselves.\nThey need to learn to respect their schoolmates.\nThey need to learn to respect their teachers.\nAnd, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.\nThat's the principle objective.\nIf you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.\nAnd the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids\nis by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day."
p5250
aS"\nObama appealed to virtue.\nAnd I think he was right.\nAnd the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,\nbecause it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --\nto be displayed at the right time and in the right way.\nHe also appealed to hope.\nRight again.\nI think there is reason for hope.\nI think people want to be allowed to be virtuous."
p5251
aS"\nIn many ways, it's what TED is all about.\nWanting to do the right thing\nin the right way\nfor the right reasons.\nThis kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us\nif only we start paying attention.\nPaying attention to what we do,\nto how we do it,\nand, perhaps most importantly,\nto the structure of the organizations within which we work,\nso as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom\nrather than having it suppressed."
